201201,Verizon Crosses Web Lines --- Wireless Arm Touts Comcast Even as Phone Giant's FiOS Battles Cable,"As Verizon Communications Inc. pushes for more cable-television and high-speed Internet subscribers, a new competitor is emerging: its own subsidiary, Verizon Wireless. This month, Verizon Wireless stores in Seattle and Portland, Ore., began offering home Internet, cable and telephone service from Comcast Corp. as part of a new joint marketing deal between the cellphone provider and several cable companies. Verizon doesn't offer its competing FiOS broadband and TV service in those markets, but the marketing deal may eventually encroach into FiOS territory, people familiar with the deal say -- setting up an awkward clash within the telephone giant. The joint effort with cable companies was unveiled by Verizon Wireless last month as part of a $3.6 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from Comcast, Time Warner Cable Inc., and Bright House Networks. The Justice Department is investigating whether the deal will hurt competition and raise prices for cable customers, people familiar with the matter said. The deal surprised the telecom industry because it appeared to signal a truce between longtime rivals. Verizon is spending more than $20 billion rolling out FiOS to compete with cable, and cable companies had amassed spectrum to potentially get into the wireless business. Verizon insists it's committed to FiOS, a fiber-optic-cable-based service that reaches about 14% of U.S. households. But for longtime observers of the rivalry between Verizon and cable providers, the companies' marketing moves in past weeks may have prompted some double-takes. In test markets Seattle and Portland, people walking into some Verizon Wireless stores are now being greeted by employees asking whether they'd heard about ""our amazing new offer with Comcast,"" according to Troy Fairchild, retail store director in the Pacific Northwest for Verizon Wireless. Further illustrating the conflict: While Verizon claims on its website that FiOS ""beats every other cable provider in speed reliability,"" a page on the Verizon Wireless website now touts Comcast as ""the fastest Internet service in the nation."" Verizon Wireless will continue to expand its Comcast offering to new markets, likely those where Verizon doesn't offer FiOS, ""at least initially,"" a Verizon spokeswoman said. Yet the deal with the cable companies does allow joint marketing in territories with FiOS, and people close to Time Warner Cable and Comcast said they expect to be cross-selling in those areas eventually. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said he needed to do the joint-marketing deal to give Verizon Wireless the ability to offer packages including video nationwide at a time when consumers are increasingly expecting content to move seamlessly between devices like TVs, tablets and smartphones. ""Wireless is a national asset, and I needed to look for an opportunity to expand that scale,"" Mr. McAdam said at a conference last month. Consumer groups have questioned whether the new partnership means Verizon and the cable companies have agreed not to encroach further into each other's markets and whether the two will no longer compete as intensively in areas where their broadband and television offerings overlap. ""It appears that this is a ceasefire,"" said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, policy director for the Media Access Project, a consumer group. ""If so, it poses very serious questions."" Both Verizon and the cable companies say they will continue to compete intensively in Verizon's FiOS markets. The Federal Communications Commission still needs to approve Verizon's spectrum purchase. Comcast Cable Chief Executive Neil Smit said at a conference last month that his company will work with Verizon Wireless to develop and integrate new products, giving Comcast ""a very important strategic competitive advantage,"" according to a transcript. Asked to confirm that Comcast would be able to use that advantage against Verizon by selling bundles of Comcast and Verizon Wireless products in territories where Verizon sells FiOS, Mr. Smit replied, ""That's correct."" Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable's chief operating officer, said on an earnings call last week that Verizon FiOS had been ""tough competitors"" in New York and said Time Warner Cable was ready to match Verizon's aggressive marketing of the service. But on the same call, Mr. Marcus praised the deal with Verizon Wireless. The potential competitive advantage for the cable companies has underscored concerns in Verizon's landline work force that the company is marginalizing its landline business in favor of the far more lucrative wireless part of the company, several current and past employees said. Verizon declined to comment. The relationship between Verizon's landline and wireless businesses is complicated by Verizon's ownership structure -- Verizon Wireless is a joint venture between Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group PLC of the U.K. -- and by the fact that many of Verizon's landline workers are union members, while their wireless counterparts aren't. ""Until this deal, Comcast is Public Enemy Number One,"" said Myles Calvey, a Boston-area leader of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 15,000 Verizon Communications employees. ""Now, they jump in bed together. It's unbelievable."" Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in a conference call last week the company would continue to use FiOS to ""compete vigorously"" with cable companies despite the new partnership.

201201,UPDATE 4-Sharp sees record net loss as TV woes spur LCD cuts,"* Forecasts $3.8 bln net loss for year to March * To cut production in half at west Japan LCD plant * Falls into operating, net loss in Oct-Dec quarter * Japan TV makers struggle with weak demand, S.Korea rivals * Sharp shares fall 4.3 pct on Thursday vs flat benchmark (Adds President comment, details) By James Topham TOKYO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Sharp Corp forecast a record 290 billion yen ($3.8 billion) net loss for the year to March after posting surprise quarterly losses as a slump in TV sales forced it to halve output at a western Japan LCD plant. The Japanese electronics maker said it was confronting a slump in both its LCD business, where it trimmed its full-year forecast for LCD TV sales to 12.8 million from 13.5 million, and in solar cells, which are also showing widening losses. ""There had already been reports that it would slip into a loss, but the amount seems to be bigger than had been expected,"" said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Inc, adding there would be a strong negative impact on the stock after a market consensus for a net loss of about 15 billion yen. ""Japan's manufacturing sector is facing a period of transition, so if Sharp goes ahead with structural reform of its operations, we can hold some hope of improvement in its results next year and beyond,"" added Hiroki. Sharp had been expected to fare better than its bigger Japanese rivals Sony Corp and Panasonic Corp, which report earnings later this week, by focusing on premium big-screen TVs that have proved popular in the U.S. market. But the company said its Sakai LCD plant would halve output for the January-March quarter, with the reduction likely to remain in place for the first half of the next financial year. Japanese electronics makers are languishing in a TV market they once dominated as they confront sluggish demand and fierce competition from South Korean manufacturers that benefit from favourable exchange rates and aggressive investments. In their home market, the Japanese have struggled with a stagnant economy, losing the boost they once got from a transition to terrestrial digital broadcasting and from subsidies for purchases of energy-efficient goods. Sales of LCD TVs nearly halved in the October-December quarter, Sharp said, although sales of TV models with screens 60 inches or bigger in the United States continued to stay robust. Sharp's Sakai facility in Osaka, capable of making the equivalent of 1.3 million panels a month for 40-inch TVs, was idled for about a month from April 2011. The Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday that the facility would cut output in half due to building inventories, spurring a slump in Sharp's share price. Shares of the maker of Aquos LCD TVs ended Wednesday trade down 4.3 percent at 628 yen, compared with a flat benchmark Nikkei average. Since the start of last year, Sharp's shares have fallen 25 percent, compared with a 14 percent drop in the Nikkei. For the full financial year to March, Sharp cut its operating profit forecast to zero from 85 billion yen. That compares with the 68.6 billion yen consensus forecast of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The manufacturer of a slew of electronics products and their components also reported quarterly sales of solar cells fell by a third from a year ago, amid price declines, slowing demand and increased competition from Chinese makers adding to its woes. ""The problems we faced this financial year from lower demand, as the euro debt crisis slowed growth in the global economy, and the strong yen, are expected to make for a bad January-March quarter,"" Sharp President Mikio Katayama said at a results briefing. For the October-December quarter, Sharp posted an operating loss of 24.45 billion yen, compared with a 23.03 billion yen operating profit in the year-ago period. Rival Toshiba Corp booked a 72 percent fall in quarterly operating profit on Tuesday and cut its annual television sales forecast. Sony said last month it had extricated itself from its LCD panel-making venture with Samsung Electronics, allowing it to source cheaper panels from the open market to try to keep pace with falling TV prices. Panasonic is also in the process of consolidating five TV panel plants into two locations. Sharp is aiming to turn its LCD panel business profitable in its next business year starting April, Katayama told reporters, by promoting its small- and medium-sized screens. The firm has been switching most production at its Kameyama LCD panel plant in western Japan to smaller panels used in popular devices such as Apple's iPad as part of a plan aimed at tapping the booming tablet and smartphone market.

201201,UPDATE 6-Apple hires Dixons chief to drive global retail,"* Browett leaving Dixons in April to lead Apple retail * Sebastian James to be new Dixons CEO * Dixons shares down nearly 9 percent; Apple up (Adds link to Breakingviews column) By James Davey and Poornima Gupta LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has hired Dixons Chief Executive John Browett, who revived the British electronics retailer by emphasizing customer service, to lead the iPad maker's global retail expansion. Apple chief Tim Cook, making his first high-profile hire since taking the helm of the world's largest technology company, lured the well-regarded industry executive to fill a critical post once held by Ron Johnson, another outsider who left Target Corp to join Apple in 2000. Johnson resigned from Apple last November to join retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc as chief executive. Browett, Dixons' CEO since 2007, was previously chief executive of Tesco Plc's successful online shopping site. He will oversee Apple's retail strategy and the expansion of its stores around the world, from the current total of around 300. The executive, credited with freshening Dixons' image with innovative marketing -- including an advertising campaign featuring Darth Vader -- joins Apple as the Silicon Valley giant eyes markets abroad to sustain its growth. ""An outsider with international experience will help guide Apple's global expansion strategy,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Abramsky. ""His experience includes localizing stores for multiple countries."" On Johnson's watch, Apple opened its first retail outlet -- in McLean, Virginia -- in May 2001. It now has a chain of more than 300 stores, which generated an average of $34.1 million each in fiscal 2010 and accounted for 15 percent of the company's net sales. ""(Browett)'s got big shoes to fill,"" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. ""Ron Johnson drove the Apple store as a customer experience with a positive halo effect for the business."" Wall Street views Apple's stores as an important advantage in competing with rivals Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc as well as other traditional PC makers. ""Our retail stores are all about customer service, and John shares that commitment like no one else we've met,"" said Cook. Click between the brackets for Breakingviews Column INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION Apple's retail success is likely to keep growing over the next few quarters as huge numbers of consumers continue to snap up the company's popular iPhones and iPads. Apple sold 37 million iPhones and more than 15 million iPads during the last quarter, and its cash balance swelled to nearly $100 billion by the end of 2011. Last week, Apple posted quarterly results ahead of market expectations. Browett's appointment has sparked speculation in some quarters that Apple may be planning a push in its retail operations in Europe, where his expertise is greatest. But Gillis said that while Browett's international experience is helpful, he did not appear to have the relevant expertise in Apple's key growth markets in Asia. In October, Best Buy abandoned plans for a chain of European megastores, while Kesa Electricals, Europe's No. 3 player, effectively paid a bidder to take the British money-losing Comet chain off its hands. Both companies, as well as Home Retail's Argos business, have struggled to compete with Dixons in the UK as Browett revamped stores, focused on more popular megastores and improved product ranges with a mantra of improving the shopping trip for customers. Shares of Dixons Retail, Europe's second-largest electronics retailer and owner of the Currys and PC World chains in Britain, fell on Tuesday following the news that Browett would leave in April to join the world's leading smartphone maker as senior vice president of retail, based in California. Dixons, which also runs Elkjop in Nordic countries, UniEuro in Italy and Kotsovolos in Greece, said Sebastian James would succeed Browett. James, who was instrumental in executing much of Dixons' turnaround plan, is the company's operations director and a former strategy director at mother and baby products retailer Mothercare. ""We understand that the (Dixons) board had already carried out external bench-marking as part of its succession plans, and had decided that internal candidates would provide the best solution,"" said Investec analyst David Jeary. Dixons shares, which rose more than 50 percent in the last month after the well-received Christmas trading update, were down 8.7 percent at 13.95 pence. Apple was up 0.25 percent at $454.12 in afternoon Nasdaq trading in New York.

201201,EXCLUSIVE-Europe sets sights on deeper mobile roaming cuts,"(Refiles to add Exclusive tag) * EU Parliament seeks lower roaming caps than July proposal * Negotiations ongoing amid intense telco lobbying * Lower roaming caps could dent telcos profits-analyst By Claire Davenport and Leila Abboud BRUSSELS/PARIS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers are seeking to further ratchet down the fees mobile operators charge users when they travel abroad, according to a draft plan seen by Reuters, taking aim at a lucrative source of industry profit. The EU Parliament is pushing for much steeper reductions in so-called roaming fees than those proposed last year by European Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The charge for a one-minute outgoing call when abroad would be 15 cents compared with Kroes's plan for a one-third cut to 24 cents. The cost of surfing the Internet would be slashed to 20 cents per megabyte from 50 cents. If the parliament's tougher caps are adopted, it would be a blow to mobile operators, which generate some 5 percent of sales and 7 percent of operating profit from roaming fees. Angelika Niebler, a German politician steering the proposed regulation through the parliament, said mobile operators should not charge customers differently depending on where they are. ""There should really be no roaming (fees) at a time when we are supposed to have a single market,"" Niebler said in an interview. The two sides are set to debate the measures in the coming months with the aim of arriving at a compromise law that would be phased in over three years starting in 2012. The tough approach from Brussels comes as large incumbent operators like Vodafone, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom face strong competition and lower mobile prices in many markets. They have yet to figure out how to translate consumers' growing appetite for smartphones and tablet computers into profits, while the need to invest heavily in fibre broadband buildouts and new fourth generation mobile networks is pressing. Stephane Beyazian, telecoms analyst at investment bank Raymond James, said the industry would not welcome steeper cuts to roaming charges but could absorb them. ""It would be a bad surprise, but it would not be catastrophic,"" he said, adding that industry was satisfied with the Kroes proposal made last summer. A telecom operator source said the measures would mean a major change to the industry's business model. ""This is the first credible step towards a roaming-free Europe,"" said the source, who favours the parliament's approach. FIRST DRAFT In her proposal last July, Kroes proposed two ways to bring down roaming charges: caps on the cost of texts, calls, and Web surfing while abroad and 'decoupling', which allows consumers to choose their provider when they cross borders. She said this would boost competition across Europe by making it easier for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which do not have their own infrastructure or spectrum, to piggyback on large operators' networks. This would allow a big retailer like Britain's Tesco to sell a cheaper mobile roaming service to a tourist visiting London. Large telecom operators operating in many European countries, such as Vodafone in Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany, tend to support ""decoupling"" because it will allow them to offer cross-border services to more customers. But smaller operators and MVNOs argue they need more help -in the form of lower rents to use other operators' networks - to be able to compete with the bigger players. ""MVNOs are concerned about high wholesale access charges, which will make it impossible for them to enter the roaming market and compete,"" said Innocenzo Genna, a consultant representing a group of independent Italian virtual operators. HORSE TRADING The parliament and the Commission are now trying to reconcile their proposals, with telecoms firms lobbying intensely in Brussels for concessions. Under the parliament's proposal, the caps proposed by Kroes would come into force in July 2012, with its steeper cuts implemented in 2013 and 2014. Niebler's draft proposal would lower the cost of incoming calls to 5 cents per minute by 2014, half the rate proposed by Kroes, and cut the price of a text message by 50 percent to 5 cents. The current caps are 35 cents for outgoing calls and 11 cents for incoming calls respectively. There are no caps in effect for what operators can charge customers using the mobile Internet while abroad.

201201,UPDATE 1-German court upholds ban of Samsung's older tablet,"* Duesseldorf court says Samsung may not sell Galaxy 10.1 * Court upholds earlier ruling * Samsung, Apple embroiled in legal battles around world (Adds details, background) FRANKFURT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics lost a bid to overturn a ruling barring its local unit from selling its Galaxy 10.1 tablets in Germany, handing a symbolic legal victory to Apple Inc in efforts to keep its lead spot in the tablet computer market. A higher regional court in Duesseldorf, Germany, said on Tuesday that Samsung may not sell the older version of its Galaxy tablet in Europe's biggest economy. Apple is fighting several rival makers of smartphones and tablet PCs in courts worldwide over intellectual property. Its battle with Samsung, whose tablets are based on Google Inc's Android software, has been especially bitter, with the Galaxy range of devices seen as among the biggest challengers to Apple's mobile products. Apple has claimed the Galaxy line of mobile phones and tablets ""slavishly"" copied the iPhone and iPad and has sued the Korean company in the United States, Australia, Japan and Korea as well as in Europe. In September, Apple won a temporary injunction barring Samsung Germany from selling the Galaxy 10.1 tablet in most of Europe, as the court found the overall design of the tablet was too similar to Apple's iPad. Since then, several countries including the Netherlands, the United States and Australia have decided to allow Samsung to sell the Galaxy tablet. Samsung, which is Apple's supplier as well as a competitor, has been trying to have the German decision overturned while also seeking other means to fight Apple. It redesigned the Galaxy Tab 10.1 for the German market only and named it Galaxy Tab 10.1N to get around the sales ban. Apple challenged the reworked version but a German court last month rejected Apple's claims in a preliminary judgment. A final ruling in that cases is expected on Feb. 9. Samsung also counter-sued Apple in Germany, claiming infringements of mobile technology patents. A court in Mannheim has ruled against Samsung in cases concerning two of the patents and is due to decide on a third on March 2.

201201,UPDATE 2-Taiwan trims 2012 GDP forecast after Q4 shrinkage,"* 2012 forecast trimmed as external demand seen weak * CPI forecast upped, could rule out rate cut * Q4 hit by tumble in investment by tech firms (Adds information, context) By Jonathan Standing TAIPEI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan trimmed its forecast for economic growth this year for a third time amid a gloomy outlook for exports, after a sharp slowdown in investment by tech companies helped push the island into a mild recession in the fourth quarter. In a sign that this year will be a tough one for Asia's exporters, the government put 2012 growth at 3.91 percent, less than the 4.19 percent it forecast late last year and the third cut since an initial forecast of 4.51 percent made in mid-2011. The economy shrank 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter on a seasonally-adjusted quarterly basis, after contracting 0.21 percent in the June-September period. Most economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of shrinkage. Taiwan is one of the most open of Asia's exporters, with an exports-to-GDP ratio of 74 percent, making it extra-vulnerable to declines in external demand. With Europe mired in a crisis of debt, austerity and rising unemployment, the U.S. recovery uncertain and China's red-hot growth slowing down, demand for Taiwan's exports is slowing sharply, and a rebound may take some time. ""I don't think there will be a substantial recovery in the current quarter,"" said Ma Tieying, economist at DBS in Singapore. ""For us to see a substantial recovery, it would be only in the second quarter. One reason is that the global uncertainty is still there. We expect first-quarter GDP growth to decline further from the previous quarter."" The Taiwan's government trimmed 2012 forecast remains more upbeat than the 3.2 percent median in a Reuters poll of 24 economists this month. Forecasts in that polled ranged from as low as 0.9 percent to as high as 4.1 percent. ""The government remains optimistic even after revising down the 2012 forecast,"" said Cheng Cheng-mount, economist at Citi in Taipei. ""It may be more bullish in the recovery in H2 because of stimulus policies it can make use of, such as attracting more investment from China by opening up the markets more."" BLEAK PERIOD FOR HI-TECH The government estimated real GDP grew 4.03 percent in 2011, less than half the 10.72 percent growth rate seen in 2010. The 0.25 percent contraction in the last quarter of 2011, compared to the previous three months, reflected a bleak period for many of the hi-tech exporters that drive Taiwan's growth. Companies such as smartphone giant HTC reported poor sales at the end of last year as the global slowdown sapped demand. TSMC, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, said this month it will reduce capital spending in 2012 as it sees slower industry growth and lower margins than expected amid a stuttering global economy. Investment was the biggest drag on the quarter, falling 19.2 percent and mirroring the drop in exports, since most private investment in Taiwan goes on its export industries. ""By industry, a number of sectors saw a YoY contraction, including manufacturing, construction, finance, insurance and real estate,"" said Frances Cheung, senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. ""It is a disappointing set of data. The road ahead should continue to be tough, and we forecast 2012 GDP growth at 3.4 percent."" Orders for Taiwan's exports, a leading indicator of actual export demand, contracted in December for the first time in two years, while growth in actual exports in the month was the slowest in more than two years. MIXED REGIONAL PICTURE The fourth-quarter figure came amid a mixed growth picture for other Asian exporters, with Philippine Q4 GDP slightly above forecasts but South Korea's well below and Singapore's contracted, signalling it could slip into recession. China meanwhile, Taiwan's top trading partner, posted above-forecast Q4 GDP but the pace of growth was still a two and half year low. For full coverage of Asian GDP, see . Taiwan's central bank is expected to hold rates steady at 1.875 percent at its next policy meeting in March, with economists noting that the government on Tuesday revised up its forecast for inflation this year to 1.29 percent from 1.14 percent. It did not cut rates at the last meeting in December, as some had expected, as it still saw danger from inflation. While the central bank has room to cut in March to give exporters a boost, its vigilance on prices may stay its hand. Some economists in fact see a quicker recovery for Taiwan, especially after the ruling party was re-elected in January's presidential and parliamentary elections, pointing to stable and open relations with trading partner China. ""The continuation of government policies will be conducive to portfolio and direct investment, including foreign investors who had taken a wait-and-see approach in the lead-up to the election,"" said Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.

It was the latest in a string of profit warnings for the maker of webcams, speakers and keyboards, over the last year as the company struggles with a weak economic environment. Logitech now expects to achieve full-year sales of some $2.3 billion, down from $2.4 billion and operating income of around $60 million, compared to its previous forecast of $90 million. ""Since we last provided our outlook for fiscal year 2012 at the end of October, several factors have changed,"" said Logitech chairman and acting chief executive Guerrino De Luca in a statement on Thursday. ""Most significantly, the euro has weakened considerably during the last three months. In addition, webcams and remotes continue to be impacted more than expected by product portfolio and market weakness."" By 0902 GMT shares in Logitech were down 13.56 percent, underperforming a flat Swiss market. ""The biggest disappointment is the guidance revision for full-year 2012 ... With that we fear confidence in management is eroding further,"" Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth said in a note. In October, De Luca promised no more bad news and the company appeared to have weathered the worst, bouncing back into the black in the second quarter after issuing two profit warnings. As well as euro weakness, Logitech is grappling with a shift towards stand-alone mobile computing systems that do not require peripheral interfaces. ""The fact that new devices like tablet PCs or smartphones function like a camera or already have keyboards integrated, is likely to raise questions about the future course of growth,"" Wegelin analysts said. Logitech's third-quarter sales fell 5 percent to $715 million, while net income dropped 15 percent to $55 million. Its results contrast with stellar earnings for Apple Inc on Tuesday after sales of its iPhone and iPads skyrocketed in the quarter, smashing Wall Street expectations.

201201,UPDATE 3-Smartphones boost profit at Apple supplier ARM,"* Q4 pretax up 45 pct to 69 mln stg vs analyst poll 55.8 mln * Q4 revenue 137.8 million stg vs f'cast 123.6 million * Sees Q1 revenue in line with market view of $200 mln * Shares up 7 pct, top FTSE riser (Adds comments on Intel threat) By Paul Sandle LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - ARM Holdings, the British chip designer whose technology powers Apple's iPad and iPhone, posted a 45 percent rise in quarterly profit and said its growth would continue to outstrip the industry as its designs were used in ever more devices. ""We have benefited from the rapid growth of smartphones, tablets and smart TVs, and many of these devices contain multiple ARM chips,"" Finance Director Tim Score told reporters on Tuesday. The Cambridge-based company, which designs the low-energy processors found in nearly all mobile phones, tablets and a host of other devices, said fourth-quarter pretax profit rose to 69 million pounds ($108 million) on revenue up 21 percent to 138 million. ARM shares rose as much as 7 percent to 640 pence, the top gain in London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, after the numbers soundly beat forecasts and the group gave a bullish outlook. Analyst Lee Simpson at brokerage Jefferies said the results handsomely beat expectations and the company was well placed to deliver a solid performance this year and next. Noting strong royalties and a high backlog of licensing deals, Simpson said: ""We see ARM in very good shape for 2012 and 2013 whatever the weather."" ARM counts royalties a quarter in arrears, so its fourth-quarters numbers do not fully capture last year's holiday season demand, including Apple's blow-out sales. BIGGEST DRIVER The group's processor designs are licensed to chipmakers such as Texas Instruments Inc, Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp, and in return it receives a royalty for every chip shipped. A record 2.2 billion chips based on ARM's technology were shipped in the fourth quarter, Score said. Royalty revenue grew 21 percent in 2011 as a whole, outstripping an 8 percent rise for the industry, the company said, as its technology was used in devices ranging from tablets to dishwashers. Smartphones, however, continue to be one of the group's biggest drivers of growth, and Score said he expected demand to remain strong in 2012. ""The smarter the phone, the more ARM technology you will find on it, and typically we would earn royalties somewhere between 5 to 10 times the level we would from a voice-only phone,"" he said. SERVER LICENCES Chief Executive Warren East said ARM had also seen strong licensing growth in 2011 as more new customers choose its technology for the first time, and the market share gains looked set to continue in 2012 as its partners introduced new chips. The 25 processor licences signed in the quarter were for the group's advanced Cortex and Mali graphics technology, ARM said, and two partners had licensed its v8-based architecture, aimed at servers and high performance computing -- sectors dominated by Intel. The U.S. group, however, is retaliating with an assault on smartphones with its Medfield chip, and has signed up Motorola Mobility and Lenovo to try to gain a foothold in the fast growing market. Score said Intel had been planning to enter the market for years. ""But we continue to introduce new technology that is higher performance and lower power at the same time,"" he said. Given ARM's very strong licence revenue in Q4, East said he expected group dollar revenue for the first quarter to be in line with market expectations of around $200 million. ARM, which is generally conservative in its guidance, also said it would at least meet market consensus of just over $860 million in revenue for 2012. Analysts were expecting fourth-quarter pretax profit of 55.8 million pounds on revenue of 123.6 million, according to a company-supplied poll of 30 analysts.

201201,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Tuesday: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock.

201201,Joplin confronts emotional question: Should it market devastated neighborhoods to tourists?,"JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) - Eight months after a tornado laid waste to much of this city, Joplin is wrestling with an emotional question: Should the community market its devastated neighborhoods to tourists? When the convention and visitors bureau recently discussed offering guided bus tours and even a smartphone app, storm victims bristled, imagining that their shattered homes could be put on display for legions of curious sightseers. But the bureau director says he wants to promote Joplin's recovery to outsiders, insisting that the effort is ""not about busted-up homes or destroyed cars or body parts."" Signs of revival are slowly emerging from the ruins left by the May 22 tornado, which killed 161 people. Debris has been cleared, and Home Depot and other stores have rebuilt. Hundreds of construction permits have been issued, too. Yet the new houses and stores are vastly outnumbered by empty lots and the concrete foundations that in many areas were all that survived the twister. So when a local television report raised the possibility that tourist buses could be allowed to crawl through neighborhoods leveled by one of the deadliest tornados in American history, people swiftly responded with angry calls and emails. ""As a family member who lost a loved one to this disaster, I find the whole subject insulting,"" said Candyce Patterson, whose fiancé's grandmother -- the woman who raised him -- died in the tornado. ""It is appalling to us that the CVB would even consider this."" Bureau Director Patrick Tuttle said the proposal for disaster tours was only an idea, and it was rejected. It was merely a response to information requests from travelers, particularly those who passed through on Interstate 44 and stopped at a Missouri welcome center. Instead, the city printed a map showing the tornado's path and including a history of Joplin, a list of tornado-related facts and a welcome message. ""Enough outsiders want to know. You have to give them something,"" Tuttle said. ""This is about recovery, about what we've done to get this city back."" Still, the backlash highlights the challenges faced by many communities that have endured major disasters: They cannot ignore interest in the events, but calling too much attention to the scarred landscape and human suffering could be seen as exploitative, insensitive or cruel. It's a debate that resonates from New Orleans, where tour companies continue to offer Hurricane Katrina bus tours, to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which is expected to attract visitors from the many soccer fans attending the Euro 2012 tournament later this year in Ukraine. In Joplin's handout, City Manager Mark Rohr encourages tourists not merely to look at the damage but to help out -- and spend money. ""Although we realize there is interest in what Joplin has been through, the real story is how we responded to the adversity we faced,"" he wrote. ""We invite you to learn more about our experiences"" and eat at a restaurant, visit some downtown shops or book a night at a hotel. ""These simple actions support jobs and provide stability for our residents and business owners,"" Rohr said. The single-sheet guide lists the locations of some ""iconic"" images of May 22, including Joplin High School and St. John's Regional Medical Center, which were both destroyed. Local photographer Aaron DuRall created the Facebook page ""Joplin Citizens Against Tornado Tours."" ""We must speak out against tasteless ventures such as these,"" he wrote. ""Not only do they cast Joplin in a bad light, but they cheapen what each of us experienced. ... What is left of people's former lives is not something to marvel at, nor is it something to profit from."" Even before tornado, the city had been planning to update its tourism campaign. Then the storm became one of the new themes. During a recent visit to the state capital, a delegation of business leaders unveiled a similar message aimed at trade associations. ""Revisit Joplin. Join the recovery. Be a part of the miracle of the human spirit,"" one poster reads, noting the support the city received from more than 117,000 volunteers. ""Our hotels, attractions and meeting facilities are open and ready to host your next meeting."" When Tuttle presented his preferred marketing firm to the Joplin City Council for approval, he emphasized the company's experience in disaster tourism in Louisiana. But the campaign will stick mostly to local history such as Joplin's legacy as a center of lead and zinc mining and its location on the famous Route 66. ""Our emphasis is on attractions and annual events,"" said Kevin McInerney, vice president of sales for Kansas City-based Propaganda Communications, the city's newly hired marketing firm. ""The tornado happened. Everybody in the country knows that."" Still, Joplin could also use the opportunity to market itself to youth sports tournaments, church groups, civic clubs and other organizations looking to combine their events with volunteer projects. ""It may be that some people came to help with the immediate tragedy. We'd like to encourage them to revisit and to come back to see some of the successes, and to potentially lend a helping hand to continue to rebuild,"" said Katie Steel Danner, director of the Missouri Division of Tourism. ""People now know the location of Joplin. Before, they may not have even been aware."" ------ Online: Joplin Convention and Visitors Bureau, www.visitjoplinmo.com ------ Follow Alan Scher Zagier on Twitter: (at)azagier 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,"Samsung takes big hit in battle against Apple as EU probes patents, Germany blocks tablets","BRUSSELS (AP) - Samsung took a double-hit in its battle against archrival Apple when the European Union announced it would investigate whether it was illegally trying to hinder competitors and Germany blocked sales of some of its tablet computers. Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc. are engaged in a strategic war over patents in many countries across the world as they try to draw market share away from each other. The EU's antitrust watchdog thinks the South Korean company may be overstepping the bounds and launched a formal investigation into whether Samsung is using lawsuits over key patents on 3G wireless technology to hinder competitors -- including Apple. The European Commission, which is acting as the EU's antitrust enforcer, said Tuesday it suspected Samsung of not giving other companies fair access to patents it holds on standardized 3G technology for mobile devices -- despite committing to do so in 1998. A spokeswoman for the Commission said the probe also affected tablets such as Apple's newest iPad, which uses standardized wireless 3G technology. The Commission said that Samsung last year sought legal injunctions against other device makers in several EU states, alleging patent infringement. Under EU patent rules, a company that holds patents for standardized products is required to license them out indiscriminately at a fair price. If Samsung is found guilty of unfairly restraining competition, it can be fined up to 10 percent of annual revenue related to the investigation. ""Samsung now has to think carefully about how it wants to deal with (the probe),"" said Florian Mueller, a patent analyst who has been closely following the battle between Samsung and Apple. In the EU, Samsung has sued Apple in Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., the Netherlands and Spain. It also has legal proceedings against its competitor in the U.S., South Korea, Japan and Australia, Mueller said. However, Mueller said, Samsung may now be inclined to withdraw its lawsuits against Apple following news of the European investigation. The battle between the two companies began in April, when Cupertino, California-based Apple sued Samsung in the United States, alleging the product design, user interface and packaging of Samsung's Galaxy devices ""slavishly copy"" the iPhone and iPad. Samsung -- the global No. 1 in TVs and No. 2 in smartphones by sales -- responded by filing its own lawsuits that accused Apple of patent infringement of its wireless telecommunications technology. A spokesman said the European Commission launched its probe after its own investigation of the market, rather than reacting to complaints from Samsung's competitors. However, the Commission last year sent antitrust questionnaires to both Apple and Samsung. The spokesman added that similar probes could also be launched against other companies strategically using patent lawsuits to stop competitors from selling similar devices. Nam Ki-yung, a spokesman at Samsung Electronics in South Korea, said his company was looking at details of the news on the probe but had no immediate comments. EU antitrust probes don't have a deadline and the Commission stressed that its investigation does not mean Samsung did indeed breach the bloc's competition rules. Samsung now gets the chance to respond to the Commission's concerns, as will other market participants. Also Tuesday, in a separate case, an appeals court in Germany ruled in favor of Apple, saying Samsung could not sell its Galaxy Tab 10.1 nor the Galaxy Tab 8.9 in the country because they too closely resembled the iPad2, in violation of unfair competition laws. ""Samsung wrongly used the enormous reputation and prestige of the iPad,"" Duesseldorf state court Presiding Judge Wilhelm Berneke wrote in his ruling. Samsung's successor tablet, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 N, was not affected by the ruling, and the company said that while the decision was disappointing, it was largely irrelevant. ""Today's ruling is of little factual relevance due to the new model Galaxy Tab 10.1 N, and ... the decision therefore is of no indicative value with respect to other legal proceedings involving the Galaxy Tab 10.1 N,"" Samsung said in an email to The Associated Press. ""Samsung will continue to take all appropriate measures, including legal action, to ensure continued consumer access to our innovative products."" Mueller concurred that the German court ruling won't have a commercial impact on the South Korean company, since it has already been selling a new model of the Galaxy tablet since November. ""The defeat in Germany is more of a symbolical nature,"" said Mueller, whose clients include Apple competitor Microsoft. The probe and victory in the German court for Apple come after the California company has met with several setbacks recently in its fight with Samsung. Most recently, a Dutch court ruled on Jan. 24 that Samsung's Galaxy Tab tablet was not a copy of Apple's iPad, and that it could continue to be sold in the Netherlands. That came on the heels of a December decision in Sydney, where the High Court dismissed Apple's appeal and said Samsung was free to sell its Galaxy tablet computers in Australia. ------ Rising reported from Berlin; Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this story from Seoul. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,ARM's Profit Rises on Gadget Demand,"LONDON—Microchip designer ARM Holdings PLC on Tuesday posted a sharp rise in fourth-quarter net profit, underpinned by strong demand for smartphones and tablets, as more of its chips find their way into increasingly smart gadgets. In the European morning, ARM shares were up 6.7% at 638 pence, valuing the company at £8.6 billion ($13.51 billion). The U.K.-based company produces microchip blueprints found in most mobile phones, including Apple Inc.'s popular iPhone, as well as tablets, computers, household electrical goods and even cars. But it was the proliferation of smartphones and new mobile tablet computers that largely boosted sales of both the license to use its technology and the royalties it receives for each product sold with an ARM chip inside. Chief Financial Officer Tim Score told reporters on a conference call Tuesday that each smartphone generates around five to 10 times the royalty payments of a voice-only phone. And with 60% of royalty revenue now generated from phones, tablets and other new mobile technology, the company managed to vastly outperform a semiconductor industry that is being crimped by the global economic crisis. Royalty revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 22% to $114.7, after a record 2.2 billion chips were shipped. Across the entire year, ARM's royalty sales rose 21%, well ahead of industry revenue growth of 8%. License revenue also grew 21% in the quarter to $78.9 million, and the company said it has signed several licenses that won't be recognized until later in the year, putting its license order backlog ahead by 20%. While ARM is increasingly being designed into high tech gadgets that consumers rely on daily, it is also subject to the vagaries of consumer demand for these products and said it is mindful of the uncertain global macroeconomic situation. Still, assuming there isn't a substantial deterioration in the economic backdrop, the company expects to generate dollar revenue in fiscal 2012 at least in line with current market expectations of $860 million. First-quarter sales are also seen in line with market forecasts of $200 million. Score said the company is planning for the full year against an industry forecast of 2% to 5% growth in semiconductor sales. For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company delivered a 11% rise in net profit to £33.1 million, from £29.7 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 21% to £137.8 million from £113.9 million, ahead of expectations of £123.6 million. Revenue in dollar terms, which is watched closely by U.K. analysts because the group generates the bulk of its sales in dollars, rose 21% to $217 million. ARM also reported a 45% jump in fourth-quarter profit before taxes and exceptional items—one of the key figures tracked by U.K. analysts. That came in at £69 million, ahead of market expectations of £55.8 million. ARM declared a final dividend of 2.09 pence a share, taking the total for 2011 to 3.48 pence.

201201,"Toshiba, Fujitsu Report Losses; Japanese Tech Companies Cut Forecasts as Thai Flooding Adds to Yen-Related Troubles","TOKYO—Toshiba Corp. swung into the red for its fiscal third quarter and slashed its full-year profit outlook, blaming the strong yen, flooding in Thailand and losses from its TV-set business. The Japanese company, whose operations include consumer electronics, semiconductors and nuclear power plants, posted a net loss of ¥10.6 billion ($138.9 million) for the three months through December, compared with a profit of ¥12.37 billion a year earlier. Fujitsu Ltd. also posted a loss and cut its forecast for the year, further signaling the harsh environment for Japanese companies. The Thai flooding, which damaged factories and disrupted supply chains, came as Japanese technology firms already were struggling with the yen's strength against both the dollar and the euro. A strong yen hurts the value of overseas earnings when returned to Japan and makes goods made in the country less price competitive overseas. Toshiba's third-quarter operating profit fell 72% to ¥10.53 billion. Revenue fell 9.3% to ¥1.441 trillion. Toshiba and Samsung Electronics Co. are the world's leading makers of NAND flash-memory chips, which store data in smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile gadgets. Toshiba said profit margin in its memory-chip business dropped to less than 11% from more than 20% in the second quarter, in part because of the yen's strength. For the fiscal year through March, the company now expects to post ¥65 billion in net, far below the ¥140 billion the company forecast in October. Toshiba lowered its revenue outlook to ¥6.2 trillion from ¥7 trillion. The forecasts assume the dollar will average ¥77 and the euro ¥99 this quarter. The dollar fetched ¥76.21 and the euro bought ¥100.50 Tuesday afternoon. Toshiba's television-set business also put a drag on results. The company now expects to sell 15 million sets globally this fiscal year, down from a previous target of 18 million. Electronics makers world-wide are struggling in the overcrowded, low-margin market. Demand has been sluggish in Japan, after record sales in fiscal 2011 thanks to a temporary government subsidy. ""The domestic TV market has slumped more than we had expected,"" Executive Vice President Makoto Kubo said at a news conference. Toshiba has focused on Asian emerging markets to make up for the slowdown in Japan, but the outcome hasn't been strong enough to offset losses in Japan and other regions, Mr. Kubo said. Fujitsu, which provides technology services and makes personal computers and mobile phones, swung to a third-quarter net loss of ¥4.3 billion from a year-earlier profit of ¥16.55 billion. ""The impact from the Thai flooding has been broader and longer than we had expected,"" Fujitsu President Masami Yamamoto said at a news conference. The company cut its net-profit forecast for the year to ¥35 billion from ¥60 billion. Fujitsu lowered its revenue outlook to ¥4.49 trillion from ¥4.54 trillion. The forecasts assume the dollar will average ¥77 and the euro ¥100 this quarter. Mr. Yamamoto said he expects the euro to hover around ¥100 beyond the fourth quarter. ""There are various ways to increase local production"" in Europe to mitigate the impact of the weak euro, he said. The company currently produces PC servers in Japan and Europe, so increasing the European portion would be one option, he said. Fujitsu is trying to make its mainstay technology services more competitive globally. But Mr. Yamamoto said Fujitsu's struggling electronic-device operation, which includes chips and components, is ""in need to some form of restructuring."" Separately, TDK Corp. said it will shut down its three electronic-component factories in northern Japan by the end of March 2013.

201201,Verizon Crosses Web Lines; Wireless Arm Touts Comcast Even as Phone Giant Battles Cable in FiOS Fight,"As Verizon Communications Inc. pushes for more cable-television and high-speed Internet subscribers, a new competitor is emerging: its own subsidiary, Verizon Wireless. This month, Verizon Wireless stores in Seattle and Portland, Ore., began offering home Internet, cable and telephone service from Comcast Corp. as part of a new joint marketing deal between the cellphone provider and several cable companies. Verizon doesn't offer its competing FiOS broadband and TV service in those markets, but the marketing deal may eventually encroach into FiOS territory, people familiar with the deal say—setting up an awkward clash within the telephone giant. The joint effort with cable companies was unveiled by Verizon Wireless last month as part of a $3.6 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from Comcast, Time Warner Cable Inc., and Bright House Networks. The Justice Department is investigating whether the deal will hurt competition and raise prices for cable customers, people familiar with the matter said. The deal surprised the telecom industry because it appeared to signal a truce between longtime rivals. Verizon is spending more than $20 billion rolling out FiOS to compete with cable, and cable companies—already competing in the telephone market with their own landline products— had amassed spectrum to potentially get into the wireless business. It also raised questions among union leaders and consumer advocates about Verizon's commitment to FiOS. Verizon insists it's committed to FiOS, a fiber-optic-cable-based service that reaches about 14% of U.S. households. But for longtime observers of the rivalry between Verizon and cable providers, the companies' marketing moves in past weeks may have prompted some double-takes. In test markets Seattle and Portland, people walking into some Verizon Wireless stores are now being greeted by employees asking whether they'd heard about ""our amazing new offer with Comcast,"" according to Troy Fairchild, retail store director in the Pacific Northwest for Verizon Wireless. New signs at the stores tout a deal from ""2 Great Companies"" and say shoppers signing up for both Verizon Wireless and Comcast's Internet, TV, and phone bundle can get a free smartphone. Further illustrating the conflict: While Verizon claims on its website that FiOS ""beats every other cable provider in speed reliability,"" a page on the Verizon Wireless website now touts Comcast as ""the fastest Internet service in the nation."" Verizon Wireless will continue to expand its Comcast offering to new markets, likely those where Verizon doesn't offer FiOS, ""at least initially,"" a Verizon spokeswoman said. Yet the deal with the cable companies does allow joint marketing in territories with FiOS, and people close to Time Warner Cable and Comcast said they expect to be cross-selling in those areas eventually. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said he needed to do the joint-marketing deal to give Verizon Wireless the ability to offer packages including video nationwide at a time when consumers are increasingly expecting content to move seamlessly between devices like TVs, tablets and smartphones. Consumer groups have questioned whether the new partnership means Verizon and the cable companies have agreed not to encroach further into each other's markets and whether the two will no longer compete as intensively in areas where their broadband and television offerings overlap. ""It appears that this is a ceasefire,"" said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, policy director for the Media Access Project, a consumer group. ""If so, it poses very serious questions."" Both Verizon and the cable companies say they will continue to compete intensively in Verizon's FiOS markets. The deal, however, could affect the competitive landscape across the country. The Federal Communications Commission still needs to approve Verizon's spectrum purchase. Comcast Cable Chief Executive Neil Smit said at a conference last month that his company will work with Verizon Wireless to develop and integrate new products, giving Comcast ""a very important strategic competitive advantage,"" according to a transcript. Asked to confirm that Comcast would be able to use that advantage against Verizon by selling bundles of Comcast and Verizon Wireless products in territories where Verizon sells FiOS, Mr. Smit replied, ""That's correct."" Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable's chief operating officer, said on an earnings call last week that Verizon FiOS had been ""tough competitors"" in New York and said Time Warner Cable was ready to match Verizon's aggressive marketing of the service. But on the same call, Mr. Marcus praised the deal with Verizon Wireless. The potential competitive advantage for the cable companies has underscored concerns in Verizon's landline work force that the company is marginalizing its landline business in favor of the far more lucrative wireless part of the company, several current and past employees said. Verizon declined to comment. The relationship between Verizon's landline and wireless businesses is complicated by Verizon's ownership structure—Verizon Wireless is a joint venture between Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group PLC of the U.K.—and by the fact that many of Verizon's landline workers are union members, while their wireless counterparts aren't. To Verizon's union workers—thousands of whom went on strike last summer as contract talks foundered—the deal with the cable companies represents a move away from Verizon's unionized landline labor, some of their leaders say. ""Until this deal, Comcast is Public Enemy Number One,"" said Myles Calvey, a Boston-area leader of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 15,000 Verizon Communications employees. ""Now, they jump in bed together. It's unbelievable."" Write to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and Thomas Catan at thomas.catan@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,Daily Report: Businesses Look for a BlackBerry Substitute; Bits,"The BlackBerry from Research in Motion was once the first choice, often the only choice, for companies choosing a phone for their employees. Research in Motion's delays of new phones has offered rivals an opportunity to grab that important market. Now it is a free-for-all, reports Brian X. Chen in The New York Times, and if what's happening in Europe is any indicator, Samsung's Android phones could be the big winner. RIM, Apple and Android phones now equally share the workplace market. In a recent global survey of information workers - people who use a computer or another smart device for at least an hour a day - Forrester Research found that 27 percent of smartphone users said they had an Android phone; 26 percent, a BlackBerry; and 24 percent, an iPhone. That means: ""Android and Apple together are eating BlackBerry's lunch,"" said Frank Gillett, a Forrester analyst. RIM's answer to the increasing popularity of Android handsets and the iPhone is a new version of the BlackBerry software, called BlackBerry 10. But phones based on the new software system have been delayed several times and are now not expected until late 2012. Thorsten Heins, the company's new chief executive, said the new software would address the ""consumerization of I.T.,"" referring to the growing trend of businesses letting their employees choose which devices they bring to work. Mr. Heins believes that RIM's advantage in the business market remains the company's focus on security. He said that RIM regularly speaks to chief information officers, who say they do not like that Android devices and iPhones have become prominent in the work place. ""They are in a pickle,"" Mr. Heins said in an interview. ""Their pickle is security. When the first big security flaw even happens in one of the large enterprises, you will see this turnaround. Wait for the day this happens."" Security concerns in Android are being addressed. Some of Samsung's new phones, like the Galaxy S II, include extra security features for enterprise customers. The newest version of Google's Android operating system, called Ice Cream Sandwich, has built-in encryption. In October, Samsung introduced a program called Samsung Approved for Enterprise, which includes a suite of tools tailored specifically for businesses. MocoNews.net, a British business news site, reports on several analysts' assessments of RIM's market share in Britain. Citing figures from research firm GfK, MocoNews said BlackBerry had managed to hold on to its title as the best-selling smartphone brand in the British market for the second year. BlackBerry took 26.3 percent of all sales in December and averaged 27.7 percent of all sales in 2011, the site reported. That must be some relief to RIM, but is still lower than figures that GfK released at the same time last year for 2010. In other RIM news on the Web, The Waterloo Record in Ontario snagged an interview with Mike Lazaridis, the former co-chief executive of RIM. He didn't say a lot that was revealing, though he did say he was buying RIM shares. The interview said in part: ""Lazaridis said he believes in the company's products, and looks forward to the next generation of products. 'Would I be buying $50 million worth of shares if I didn't?' he asked."" * Many Smartphone Customers Are Still Up for Grabs * Why Can't PCs Work More Like iPhones? * For a Palm Rebound, the Phone Is Not Enough * Samsung Pokes Fun at Apple in Phone Ad * Smartphone Market Expected to Soar in 2011 The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120130e81u003bh ",NYT Blogs,30 January 2012,619 words,daily report business look blackberry substitute bit,blackberry research motion first choice often company choosing phone employee delay new offered rival opportunity grab important market freeforall report brian x chen york time whats happening europe indicator samsungs android big winner rim apple equally share workplace recent global survey information worker people use computer another smart device least hour day forrester found percent smartphone user said iphone mean together eating lunch frank gillett forrester analyst answer increasing popularity handset iphone version software called based system delayed several expected thorsten heins chief executive consumerization referring growing trend business letting bring mr heins belief advantage remains focus security regularly speaks officer like iphones become place pickle mr heins interview flaw even happens one enterprise turnaround happens addressed samsungs galaxy ii include extra feature customer newest google operating called ice cream sandwich builtin encryption october samsung introduced program called samsung approved includes suite tool tailored specifically moconewsnet british news assessment britain citing figure firm gfk moconews managed title bestselling smartphone brand british second year took sale december averaged reported must relief lower gfk released last web waterloo record ontario snagged mike lazaridis former cochief didnt lot revealing though buying lazaridis product forward next generation million worth didnt asked many smartphone cant pc iphones palm rebound enough samsung poke fun ad smartphone soar york document nytbeubh
201201,INTERVIEW-Artprice eyes sales boost from online auctions,"PARIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - French art database and ad specialist Artprice.com expects sales to soar this year on the back of the launch of an online auction service, its chief executive told Reuters on Monday. The company, whose shares have risen 470 percent in the last 12 months, sees revenue reaching tens of millions of euros, compared with 3.8 million ($5 million) in the first nine months of last year, Thierry Ehrmann said in an interview. ""I think we will do in 2012 what we expected to do in 2013, 2014,"" Ehrmann said. The CEO expects at least 90,000 works of art to go up for sale on the online auction service this year, the equivalent of about 250 a day, though the site has seen more than three times that amount daily in the 12 days since it launched. Artprice.com was founded in 1987 and began by selling databases to consumers and professionals on the lookout for specialised information about artists, fairs, classified advertisements and upcoming auctions on a single platform. The group, which competes in some areas with Germany's Artnet, then launched various websites offering real-time prices, market indicators and indexes along with auction results through a mix of free and monetised content. Ehrmann expects online auction sales to make up around 90 percent of the total in the next three years. In 2012, he predicts up to 3 million clients will take part in the auctions. Artprice.com attracted 1.3 million subscribers last year. ""From what we see in January, it is evident that we are going to see a metamorphosis of our top and bottom lines which is spectacular,"" said Ehrmann, a visual artist and sculptor. The company is also looking to team up with Google to have a built-in application for use on smartphones and tablets using Google's Android operating system, Ehrmann said. It has developed 12 mobile and tablet applications, an important ""growth engine"" according to Ehrmann. Artprice.com, headquartered at the Abode of Chaos open-air contemporary art museum near Lyon displaying 4,000 works of art, targets a core market of art pieces worth between $15,000 and $150,000. The company, which provides a free advertisement service, charges commissions of 5-9 percent on auction sales. Ehrmann added that he planned to open a Hong Kong unit this year and hoped China, Taiwan and Hong Kong sales would grow to 55 percent of the total by 2013 from 35 percent currently. China has become the world's largest art market, while France's fine art market has struggled, according to the CEO.

201201,"RESEARCH ALERT-JP Morgan initiates Erajaya with ""neutral""","JAKARTA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Following is a list of Indonesian stock price target changes and rating changes.   Initiate with Neutral: Our Dec-12 PT is Rp1300, based on 9x FY12E target P/E, in line with regional distributor peers. The stock has done well since its IPO, and as our PT implies only modest upside considering the low liquidity, we initiate coverage with a Neutral rating. We already model significant earnings growth in 2012 thanks to the TAM acquisition (concluded in Aug 2011), which we believe is a good deal that comes with strong potential as it marries a strong distribution and a great brand principal base. In order for further upside, Erajaya would need to demonstrate further acquisition synergy through margin expansion, and/ or strong organic growth post acquisition. Largest Indonesia handset distributor: Established in 1996, Erajaya is a leading handset/tablet distributor and retailer in Indonesia, with approximately 24% revenue share in 2010 according to Frost & Sullivan. Its brands include Nokia, Blackberry (via Brightpoint), Samsung, Apple, and Huawei. It operates 70 distribution points, 236 retail outlets, and has distribution networks of over 16,000 third-party resellers across Indonesia. We estimate the distribution and retail divisions will account for 84% and 16% of FY12E revenues, respectively. Distribution and retail sales are expected to grow at a 30% and 54% CAGR, respectively, from FY11E to FY13E, based on Frost & Sullivan's estimates. Investment case: We believe Erajaya's leading position puts it in the sweet spot in the Indonesian handset market: 1) Indonesian handset penetration is low (58%), and youthful demographics bode well for adoption of smartphones - Erajaya distributes most of the best-selling smartphones/tablets in the market; 2) Consolidation should lead to margin expansion among the top Indonesian handset distributors. Erajaya may find inorganic growth drivers in: a) the TAM acquisition - increasing mix of direct distribution improves margins, while more capital investment results in market share gains; and b) growth beyond handsets into tablets and content management. Investment risks: Specifically with regards to the Indonesian market, new competition may come from: 1) global distributors - Synnex Technology International entered PC distribution in late 2010 via a JV with MEB, and it intends to enter handsets within 3-5 years; 2) some top brands may directly manage their distribution and rely on distributors only on fulfillment - Samsung already has its own distribution team in Indonesia, Nokia also has done this in India; and 3) potential entry of large minimarkets such as Indomart and Alfamart into handset sales. Common cyclical risks for distributors are: 1) inventory and receivable risks; and 2) unexpected currency fluctuation.

201201,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Jan. 23: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Jan. 24: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Jan. 25: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. predicts it will start the new year with a surprisingly strong quarter. The outlook helps assure investors that LSI is past the problems caused by the hard disk shortages, which had threatened to have ripple effects on LSI's semiconductors for data storage and networking. Jan. 26: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. Marvell Technology lowers its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, citing Thailand flooding and weak year-end demand among mobile and wireless customers. Emulex Corp., a maker of data storage and network equipment, says it was able to restore full production capacity at a cost of $2.1 million, reducing gross margins during the latest quarter. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Coming up: Tuesday: Amazon.com Inc. Wednesday: Qualcomm Inc.

201201,"The BlackBerry, Trying to Avoid the Hall of Fallen Giants","FORGET the Union —  what’s the state of the BlackBerry? Research in Motion, maker of BlackBerry smartphones and tablets, sent its co-chief executives packing last week and replaced them with Thorsten Heins, who had been RIM’s chief operating officer. How would he characterize his employer? “We make the best communications devices in the world,” said Mr. Heins, who met with editors and reporters from The New York Times on Friday. Not everyone feels the same way. Over the last year, RIM’s share price has plunged 75 percent. The company once commanded more than half of the American smartphone market. Today it has 10 percent. RIM has two, maybe three ways forward. The first — the one that Mr. Heins is clearly aiming for — is a triumphant comeback after a near-death experience. Think Apple and its iMac. RIM is on the verge of upgrading its PlayBook operating system — now with, among other things, e-mail, a feature that the original PlayBook bafflingly lacked — and will release the BlackBerry 10 OS this year. Behind Door No. 2 is a gradual decline and diminution as rivals like Apple, Google and Microsoft devour most of the market; to some degree, they already have. BlackBerry would keep the scraps — a small but dedicated following of corporate and government customers who want its proprietary messaging and security features. Then there is the third option: oblivion. The road of progress is littered with the corpses of fallen titans. Objects that once seemed as indispensable as the companies that made them have been mercilessly superseded — as seen below. And RIM ought to know: with mobile devices like the BlackBerry 957, it helped to extinguish the pager era. SONY WALKMAN (1979-2010)  Before the Walkman, “personal audio” meant holding a transistor radio to your ear. Sony’s invention created an entire category of devices and helped make the company the technology leader of the 1980s. New models (Thinner! Auto-reverse!) were eagerly anticipated, the LP was relegated to the attic and tender moments spent listening to mix tapes from that certain someone proliferated across teenage bedrooms. Sony seemed incapable of putting a foot wrong. It successfully moved the brand into compact discs with the Discman, then bought record labels and movie studios to bring about that illusory marriage of technology and content. When the digital revolution hit, Sony was too beholden to its proprietary formats, as well as to the inertia inside its media companies. Enter Apple and the iPod. PAGERS (BORN 1951)  At first, pagers were attached to people who worked in fields where lives were on the line. That usually meant doctors, though the group expanded in the late 1980s to include drug dealers. Early beepers displayed only numbers, giving rise to a numerical lexicon that included codes like 911 (call me back immediately) and 07734, which resembles “hello” when read upside down. Pagers briefly gained fame in early 1990s hip-hop, showing up in songs like “Skypager,” by a Tribe Called Quest. The pager’s fall  was attributable to the disruptive and destructive powers of another technology: the mobile phone. Why beep when you can talk? And a pager message is so tiny that it makes a tweet look like “The Iliad.” The beeper does live on, in limited circles: its network remains more reliable than cell networks, making it useful to E.M.S. and other rescue workers. PALM PILOT (1997-2007) Filofax brought personal organizers to their analog apogee in the early ’90s, but Palm brought them into the digital age. Palm Pilots were dazzling when they first appeared: all of your contacts, calendars and notes in one slim, pocket-size device. A touch screen, which required a stylus, made navigation easy. And you could add software, bought through an online store. Want a Zagat guide to go along with your personal data? No problem. In later years, Palm even added telephone features, creating a compelling, all-in-one gadget. Despite boardroom dramas that affected the company’s name and its ownership, Palm’s reputation as a source of innovative hardware and software endured until Jan. 9, 2007. Why that date? That’s when Apple introduced the iPhone. POLAROID INSTANT CAMERAS (1948-2008) Edwin Land’s invention of instant-developing film in 1948 put a darkroom inside a handheld camera. That achievement gave his Polaroid Corporation a distinct advantage over traditional film cameras. By 1980, Polaroid was selling 7.8 million cameras a year in the United States — more than half of all the 15 million cameras, instant and traditional, sold that year. In 1985, it won a major patent-infringement suit, forcing Kodak to abandon its own instant-camera efforts. The victory was short-lived. The late ’80s brought the rise of the digital camera. By 2000, digital cameras began appearing on cellphones, placing  cameras in millions of pockets. Polaroid declared bankruptcy for the first time in 2001 and stopped making instant film in 2008. Kodak declared bankruptcy on Jan. 19. ATARI 2600 (1977-c.1984) It wasn’t the first game console, but the Atari 2600 brought video games into the home and popular culture. Over its life span, more than 30 million were sold. Pong, Combat, Pitfall and Frogger soaked up children’s afternoons. Then came the PC, which could play games and do much more. Atari rushed out games, assuming that its customers would play whatever it released. They didn’t. Millions of unsold games and consoles were buried in a New Mexico landfill in 1983. Warner Communications, which bought Atari in 1976 for $28 million, sold it in 1984 for no cash.

201201,"RPT-INTERVIEW-RIM CEO eyes ""significant"" plans for BlackBerry","(Repeats story from Friday, Jan 27) * To present plans to board in 2 weeks * Says RIM ""not turnaround candidate"" * Promises LTE PlayBook in Spring * Says has plan for U.S. revival By Sinead Carew and Nicola Leske NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Research in Motion's Thorsten Heins plans to waste no time in his new job. The BlackBerry maker's chief executive said he will present the board with his plan for company's future in just a matter of weeks. The German-born executive, who took over from two longstanding co-CEOs on Saturday, said his plans for RIM would be ""significant"" though he did not divulge details in an interview with Reuters. ""I will have time with the board in two weeks to present my ideas and changes,"" Heins said. But the executive, who was promoted from the role of chief operating officer, said he has already done groundwork to tackle his company's most pressing problem - persuading the U.S. market to covet the BlackBerry again. While RIM is growing in other countries, Heins conceded that its U.S. business is in need of a major revival after losing out to rivals like Apple Inc's iPhone at U.S. service providers and corporations, where it once had a clear advantage among employees heavily dependent on its email service. ""In general I wouldn't consider RIM as a turnaround candidate. It is a turnaround candidate in the U.S.,"" he said. ""We lost market share in this market quite substantially. That is something that we have to address."" While U.S. operators such as Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc have helped BlackBerry with heavy advertising and promotions in the past, these operators have been much more focused in the last few years on devices like iPhone and smartphones based on the Google Inc operating system. Heins' quest to regain ground with these operators has been complicated by the fact that RIM had to announce in December that it is delaying the launch of phones based on BlackBerry 10 - its next-generation software - until the later part of 2012 as it is awaiting the availability of a high-powered chip. The executive would not say when exactly these phones would hit the market but implied that they would arrive in time for the year-end holiday-shopping season in the fourth quarter. So in the meantime, Heins will concentrate on getting the most current BlackBerrys into more consumers hands. He noted that only 20 percent of U.S. BlackBerry users have the company's latest phones, which he says are competitive with rival smartphones. The rest of RIM's U.S. customers have devices with older RIM software, some of which are ""two generations behind,"" he said. To overcome this, RIM has devised a new upgrade plan with U.S. operators to promote phones with the BlackBerry 7 system, which was launched in August last year. ""All the plans are ready. The carrier agreements are all ready. Now we have to get off the starting grid. Now we need to execute that upgrade program,"" Heins said. While he did not want to disclose specifics about the new agreements, Heins said RIM could look at new ways of bundling different devices together or offering carriers smartphones with a package of pre-loaded applications. He is also betting on the company's PlayBook tablet to compete with the Apple iPad tablet. This spring, Heins said that RIM will launch a version of the Playbook, with a high-speed wireless connection based on LTE - a technology that the top three U.S. operators are building into their networks. Verizon Wireless and AT&T are already promoting LTE devices including smartphones and tablets from RIM's rivals. RIM's first smartphones with LTE connections will be in the company's BlackBerry 10 line-up, Heins said. MOMENT OF SURPRISE In his first presentation to Wall Street as CEO earlier this week, Heins said he did not think the company needed drastic change, causing some analysts to worry that the executive would not do enough to reverse the company's fortunes. But the executive said on Friday that he was merely telling Wall Street that he does not want to change the core of RIM. ""Is RIM up for sale, is RIM up for a split-up?"" He rejected those possibilities as ""a drastic, seismic change because it would tear the company apart."" Heins, who has been with RIM for four years after spending over two decades at German engineering group Siemens, was became COO responsible for software and products seven months ago. He explained that RIM had succession plans for co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in place for some time and that he had an inkling that he was being groomed to follow in their footsteps when he was named COO. ""The moment they tell you it's still a surprise,"" Heins said, smiling broadly and adding that he immediately said yes. Lazaridis and Balsillie, who turned the BlackBerry maker into a global company and a household name, stepped down last week but will remain on the board. Some analysts have worried whether these executives would have too much of a say in the future strategy of the company because of their position on the board. Heins said, it would be an advantage to be able to tap into the experience and company knowledge of RIM founder Lazaridis, but he made it clear that he would be the one calling the shots. ""What I do with the company is my decision. The CEO runs the company.""

201201,Overheard: Apple Pulls Ahead of Samsung by a Nose,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary] It's Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral: Apple and Samsung have turned the smartphone market into a two-horse race. They were virtually neck and neck in the fourth quarter: Apple sold 37 million iPhones, to Samsung's 36.5 million smartphones. Apple held 23.9% of the market; Samsung, 23.5%, according to Strategy Analytics. Apple had fallen behind in the third quarter due to the later-than-usual release of its newest iPhone model. But it all worked out in the end. A new release, coming just in time for the holidays, helped Apple set a record for shipments. Publicity surrounding Steve Jobs' death just nine days before also may have juiced sales. Samsung, meanwhile, benefits by having global distribution reach second only to Nokia, according to Strategy Analytics. It also has a broader portfolio of phones than Apple, including the low-end Galaxy Y model for cost-sensitive buyers. What is interesting is that Apple passed Samsung without a low-end product.

201201,"INTERVIEW-RIM CEO eyes ""significant"" plans for BlackBerry","* To present plans to board in 2 weeks * Says RIM ""not turnaround candidate"" * Promises LTE PlayBook in Spring * Says has plan for U.S. revival By Sinead Carew and Nicola Leske NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Research in Motion's Thorsten Heins plans to waste no time in his new job. The BlackBerry maker's chief executive said he will present the board with his plan for company's future in just a matter of weeks. The German-born executive, who took over from two longstanding co-CEOs on Saturday, said his plans for RIM would be ""significant"" though he did not divulge details in an interview with Reuters. ""I will have time with the board in two weeks to present my ideas and changes,"" Heins said. But the executive, who was promoted from the role of chief operating officer, said he has already done groundwork to tackle his company's most pressing problem - persuading the U.S. market to covet the BlackBerry again. While RIM is growing in other countries, Heins conceded that its U.S. business is in need of a major revival after losing out to rivals like Apple Inc's iPhone at U.S. service providers and corporations, where it once had a clear advantage among employees heavily dependent on its email service. ""In general I wouldn't consider RIM as a turnaround candidate. It is a turnaround candidate in the U.S.,"" he said. ""We lost market share in this market quite substantially. That is something that we have to address."" While U.S. operators such as Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc have helped BlackBerry with heavy advertising and promotions in the past, these operators have been much more focused in the last few years on devices like iPhone and smartphones based on the Google Inc operating system. Heins' quest to regain ground with these operators has been complicated by the fact that RIM had to announce in December that it is delaying the launch of phones based on BlackBerry 10 - its next-generation software - until the later part of 2012 as it is awaiting the availability of a high-powered chip. The executive would not say when exactly these phones would hit the market but implied that they would arrive in time for the year-end holiday-shopping season in the fourth quarter. So in the meantime, Heins will concentrate on getting the most current BlackBerrys into more consumers hands. He noted that only 20 percent of U.S. BlackBerry users have the company's latest phones, which he says are competitive with rival smartphones. The rest of RIM's U.S. customers have devices with older RIM software, some of which are ""two generations behind,"" he said. To overcome this, RIM has devised a new upgrade plan with U.S. operators to promote phones with the BlackBerry 7 system, which was launched in August last year. ""All the plans are ready. The carrier agreements are all ready. Now we have to get off the starting grid. Now we need to execute that upgrade program,"" Heins said. While he did not want to disclose specifics about the new agreements, Heins said RIM could look at new ways of bundling different devices together or offering carriers smartphones with a package of pre-loaded applications. He is also betting on the company's PlayBook tablet to compete with the Apple iPad tablet. This spring, Heins said that RIM will launch a version of the Playbook, with a high-speed wireless connection based on LTE - a technology that the top three U.S. operators are building into their networks. Verizon Wireless and AT&T are already promoting LTE devices including smartphones and tablets from RIM's rivals. RIM's first smartphones with LTE connections will be in the company's BlackBerry 10 line-up, Heins said. MOMENT OF SURPRISE In his first presentation to Wall Street as CEO earlier this week, Heins said he did not think the company needed drastic change, causing some analysts to worry that the executive would not do enough to reverse the company's fortunes. But the executive said on Friday that he was merely telling Wall Street that he does not want to change the core of RIM. ""Is RIM up for sale, is RIM up for a split-up?"" He rejected those possibilities as ""a drastic, seismic change because it would tear the company apart."" Heins, who has been with RIM for four years after spending over two decades at German engineering group Siemens, was became COO responsible for software and products seven months ago. He explained that RIM had succession plans for co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in place for some time and that he had an inkling that he was being groomed to follow in their footsteps when he was named COO. ""The moment they tell you it's still a surprise,"" Heins said, smiling broadly and adding that he immediately said yes. Lazaridis and Balsillie, who turned the BlackBerry maker into a global company and a household name, stepped down last week but will remain on the board. Some analysts have worried whether these executives would have too much of a say in the future strategy of the company because of their position on the board. Heins said, it would be an advantage to be able to tap into the experience and company knowledge of RIM founder Lazaridis, but he made it clear that he would be the one calling the shots. ""What I do with the company is my decision. The CEO runs the company.""

201201,"Corporate News: Nintendo Falters, Lowers Outlook","TOKYO -- Grappling with a sluggish debut for its new hand-held game system and ebbing demand for its flagship home console, Nintendo Co. posted a loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year and scaled back sales forecasts for its 3DS portable system and Wii. The Japanese videogame maker also offered a bleaker forecast for the full fiscal year ending in March, saying Thursday that its net loss will be three times as steep as its projections in October, as valuation losses on foreign-currency holdings stemming from the strong yen continue to swell. The nine-months loss comes as Nintendo is replacing aging videogame machines with new ones, while trying to cope with the technological change in the industry, specifically smartphones and tablet computers offering simple-to-play games at a fraction of the price of games available on dedicated game machines, such as the 3DS. For the full fiscal year, Nintendo expects a net loss of 65 billion yen ($836 million) on revenue of 660 billion yen. It had been projecting a loss of 20 billion yen on revenue of 790 billion yen. Nintendo's Wii game system was once a champion on the market but its popularity has waned. A successor, the Wii U, is set to come out later this year. Last February Nintendo introduced the 3DS, a hand-held game system with the ability to play 3-D games without the need for special glasses, but the initial consumer response was weak. To kick-start demand, Nintendo slashed the price of the 3DS by 40% in August. In the run-up to the holiday shopping season, Nintendo also introduced 3DS versions of two popular game franchises, with ""Super Mario 3D Land"" and ""Mario Kart 7."" Nintendo doesn't break out figures on a quarterly basis, but price cuts on 3DS and some new software titles sparked some demand for the portable game machine during the three months ended in December. Based on calculations from Nintendo's figures, it sold 8.36 million 3DS units during the October-December period, or more than it had sold in its previous three quarters combined. Still, sales of the 3DS fell short of Nintendo's expectation. The company said it is now targeting sales of 14 million 3DS units, short of its October target to sell 16 million, for the current fiscal year. For the Wii, it is now projecting sales of 10 million units, a 20% reduction from its prior estimates. For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Nintendo posted a net loss of 48.35 billion yen, swinging from a year-earlier profit of 49.56 billion yen. On an operating basis, Nintendo had a loss of 16.41 billion yen. Revenue fell 31.2% to 556.17 billion yen. Compounding Nintendo's losses is a stubbornly strong yen. The Japanese currency is hovering near records. The company said it incurred foreign-exchange losses of 53.7 billion yen for the nine-month period. Nintendo changed its foreign-exchange rate expectations for this fiscal year, lowering its assumption for the euro to 98 yen from 106 yen. For the dollar, it maintained its assumption at 77 yen. Nintendo keeps much of its cash in foreign currencies, so the yen's rise inflates the paper losses on its reserves. Similarly, the company also incurs paper gains when the Japanese currency weakens. In Thursday trading in Tokyo, Nintendo shares slipped 70 yen, or 0.65%, to 10,780 yen.  Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,"AT&T Stuck Behind Verizon --- In Race to Win New Contract Customers, AT&T Falls Short in Latest Quarter","AT&T Inc. sold its highest level of smartphones during the holiday quarter, but the phone giant is still lagging behind Verizon Wireless in the race to win new contract customers and draw even more revenue from them. AT&T said Thursday it added 717,000 customers with lucrative two-year contracts in the fourth quarter, a 79% jump from a year earlier, on the strength of 7.6 million iPhone activations and 9.4 million smartphone sales overall. But the second largest wireless carrier is adding fewer contract customers than bigger rival Verizon Wireless, which brought in 1.2 million such subscribers in the same period despite fewer smartphone activations. Most of AT&T's iPhone and smartphone sales are going to existing subscribers. AT&T is also falling behind in another key metric -- growth in average revenue per user, or ARPU -- which was 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with 2.5% for Verizon Wireless. AT&T did end the year with a lead in ARPU, bringing in $63.76 per month compared with Verizon Wireless' $54.80. As the carriers duke it out for a dwindling number of available customers, the need to pull more money from subscribers will become increasingly important. AT&T took a step in that direction this month by raising the price of smartphone and tablet data plans by $5. An AT&T spokeswoman said the higher-priced data plans should help drive ARPU this year, as will the move by customers upgrading to smartphones. ""We also get more than $6 more in postpaid ARPUs than any of our competitors,"" she added. Even with the shift to data-heavy smartphones, carriers' ARPU isn't growing as fast as they'd like because they're struggling to maintain revenue from voice usage. Craig Moffett, an analyst at research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, estimates AT&T recorded a 6.2% drop in monthly average revenue from voice services last quarter from a year earlier, the company's biggest decline, he said. AT&T doesn't break out this number. AT&T said Thursday it is targeting a 2% lift to ARPU this year, while Verizon Wireless vowed this week to grow the measure by at least 2.5%. In the fourth quarter, AT&T posted a $6.68 billion loss due to one-time costs -- notably a $4 billion charge for its failed T-Mobile USA takeover bid. The carrier also contributed $1 billion to its pension plan. Revenue rose 3.6% to $32.5 billion. Like Verizon Wireless, AT&T's wireless profit margins suffered due to hefty outlays for subsidizing the iPhone and other handsets upfront in exchange for two-year customer commitments. The carrier reported its wireless service margin, not including some expenses, fell to 28.7% from 37.6%. The fourth-quarter margin was 42.2% at Verizon Wireless, a venture jointly owned by Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. AT&T also saw a spike in the rate at which customers leave its network. That measure, known as churn, rose to 1.39% in the quarter from 1.32% a year earlier. Verizon Wireless pared churn to 1.23% from 1.26% in the prior period. To keep pace with Verizon Wireless after pulling its $39 billion T-Mobile bid, AT&T will need to focus on the rollout of its fourth-generation mobile network. AT&T's 4G LTE network covers just over a third of the number of Americans as its competitor, and the company is growing more reliant on Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which operates only on 3G networks, to draw long-term customers. ""In 2012, we expect to double our LTE coverage,"" Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a conference call with analysts. That would take AT&T's 4G coverage to about 150 million Americans, still 50 million fewer than Verizon Wireless today. Stephens said AT&T expects to dial up about 25 million smartphone sales this year, about the same as in 2011, which was a record for the carrier. Late last year, AT&T walked away from its deal for T-Mobile after battling for nine months against resistance from the Justice Department, Federal Communications Commission, state attorneys general and some competitors. On Thursday's call Chief Executive Randall Stephenson blasted the FCC, faulting the agency for standing in the way of industry growth by failing to organize an auction for spectrum licenses and for opposing the T-Mobile deal. ""This FCC made it abundantly clear that they'll not allow significant M&A to help bridge and free up spectrum,"" Stephenson said. ""The FCC is intent on picking winners and losers rather than letting these markets work."" Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,Digits | Insights from WSJ.com,"RealNetworks Sells Patents to Intel Intel Corp. agreed to pay $120 million to RealNetworks Inc. for video software and a large number of patents, in a deal that builds the chip maker's portfolio for streaming media on smartphones, laptops and other devices. Intel will receive about 190 patents and 170 patent applications, as well as software that allows the quick compression or decompression of video for streaming. RealNetworks, meanwhile, will be able to use the patents in current and future products. ""To bring new technology like that [video software] to market requires significant reach into the consumer and business markets,"" RealNetworks Chief Executive Thomas Nielsen said in an interview. ""A partner like Intel has the capacity and size to do that."" The deal -- which sent RealNetworks shares soaring 35% to $9.89 -- is the latest move by a large technology company to scoop up key patents. Bidding for intellectual property peaked in June, when a coterie of companies paid $4.5 billion to bankrupt telecommunications-equipment maker Nortel Networks for 6,000 patents. -- Shara Tibken Time Warner Cable Combats Cord Cutting Time Warner Cable Inc. lost 129,000 video subscriptions in the latest quarter. The cable company noted that competition from Verizon Communications Inc.'s FiOS service in New York was more aggressive in the quarter. ""Our performance was relatively weaker,"" Chief Operating Officer Rob Marcus told analysts on a conference call. In contrast, Time Warner Cable added 117,000 residential high-speed data customers, boosting its revenue from that category by 8.6%. Time Warner Cable, the second biggest cable provider after Comcast Corp., in terms of subscribers, finished the quarter with 9.8 million high-speed data residential customers and 11.9 million video subscribers. ""Broadband was a real success story in the fourth quarter,"" Mr. Marcus said. Sale of broadband service gives cable operators a hedge against the possibility that large numbers of consumers cut off their TV subscriptions in favor of online video services like Netflix Inc's video-streaming service. The TV industry is closely watching for signs of that happening, although Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Glenn Britt said on Thursday ""most people watch a lot of TV"" and online services ""are not at this point a substitute for that."" -- Shalini Ramachandran Leap Loses Finance Chief Leap Wireless International Inc. said its chief financial officer, Walter Berger, will leave the wireless operator for another job in the technology sector.

201201,Nokia Discerns Hope in New Phone,"Corrections & Amplifications Nokia Corp. has sold more than one million of its new Windows-based Lumia handsets to date. A Marketplace article on Friday incorrectly stated the company had sold that amount in the fourth quarter. (WSJ JAnuary 28, 2012) (END) HELSINKI -- In the first test of Nokia Corp.'s turnaround plan, the handset maker said sales of its first Windows smartphones were off to a good start even as its overall shipments continued to slide. Chief Executive Stephen Elop said Nokia sold well over one million of its new Windows-based Lumia handsets in the fourth quarter. He pledged to bring the Lumia series to additional markets including China and Latin America in the first half of 2012 to further boost sales. Despite the introduction of the Lumia, Nokia's overall smartphone shipments fell 31% to 19.6 million in the holiday quarter. By comparison, Apple Inc. said iPhone shipments more than doubled to 37 million in the same period from a year earlier. Also Thursday, Motorola Mobility Inc. reported it shipped 5.3 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.9 million a year earlier. Motorola, which makes the line of Droid handsets and has agreed to be acquired by Google Inc., posted a loss of $80 million as revenue was flat at $3.4 billion. Mr. Elop last year embarked on a strategy to use Windows software to regain market share, after his company struggled to compete with its Symbian software against the iPhone and smartphones using Google's Android software. On Thursday, he said that due to competition from Chinese manufacturers in particular, the company would sell fewer Symbian smartphones than originally planned. Sales in Nokia's key Devices & Services unit fell 29% to around 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in the quarter, as average handset prices declined to 53 euros from 69 euros a year ago. Nokia's feature-phone units slipped 1% to 93.9 million. The company said its Devices & Services profit would be ""around break-even"" for the first quarter. ""While we progressed in the right direction in 2011, we still have a tremendous amount to accomplish in 2012 in order to properly position Nokia for sustainable long-term growth,"" Mr. Elop said on a conference call to analysts. ""We are now in the heart of our transition."" The world's largest handset maker by volume swung to a 1.07 billion euros ($1.4 billion) loss for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a 745 euros million profit in the year-earlier quarter. Nokia's results were dragged down by 1.43 billion euros in charges and write-downs. The company posted 10 billion euros in sales, down 21% from a year earlier. Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said Nokia's shipments were in line with expectations. ""Overall, what we have been looking for is an improvement over the third quarter, and we got that. But while it seems Nokia is on track, there is still a lot more to do,"" she said. Nokia Siemens Networks, the joint venture between Nokia and Germany's Siemens AG, posted a 67 million-euro operating profit in the quarter on sales of 3.82 billion euros, down 4% from a year ago. In a separate announcement, Nokia said it would propose that director Risto Siilasmaa replace Jorma Ollila as chairman of the company's board. Mr. Ollila said in 2010 that he would step down as chairman this year. The board will also propose a dividend of 0.20 euros per share be paid for the fiscal year 2011. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,Heard on the Street / Financial Analysis and Commentary,"Banks' Zero-Tolerance Tested by Fed Just wait until rates rise. That has been the refrain for some time from a host of financial firms groaning under the weight of zero interest rates. Now, with the Federal Reserve saying U.S. rates may stay near zero until late 2014, those firms look like Vladimir and Estragon waiting for Godot. And there is a cost to this so-far- fruitless vigil. The Fed's zero-interest-rate policy, which began in December 2008, coupled with its extraordinary moves to bring down long-term rates, have pressured profits at big banks. Meanwhile, insurers, pension funds, asset managers and others are seeing investment returns and income crimped. Of course, dealing with interest-rate cycles is part of the financial business. But this time is quite different. If the Fed finally raises rates by late 2014, its zero-rate policy will have lasted six years. That raises fears that financial firms are facing a structural change in the rate environment. This could lead to further cost cutting and shedding of businesses, even as firms grapple with upheaval caused by regulatory change. There is the additional risk that the Fed's outlook could be flawed and that it has to raise rates earlier than expected. In that case, finance executives who make changes based on the Fed could actually end up wrong-footed by the central bank. A prolonged period of ultralow rates hurts because asset returns fall but, over time, firms get less benefit from lower funding costs. One clue to the cost comes from estimates banks provide on the potential impact of a sudden change in rates. In the third quarter, for example, J.P. Morgan Chase said that a one-percentage-point rise in all interest rates would boost pretax earnings over a 12-month period by about $2.5 billion. A rate move twice that size would result in a benefit of $4.5 billion. Bank of America tells a similar tale. It said a one-percentage-point increase in rates would boost interest income by $1.4 billion. The reason for such gains: Banks are often able to increase the price of loans faster than they have to increase their cost of funding for, say, deposits. They are also able to roll maturing investments into higher-yielding instruments. And rising rates usually come with stronger economic growth, which leads to more lending and fewer bad debts. The biggest banks face particular pressure on net interest margins. This is largely because they have a higher proportion of assets in investments, as opposed to loans, than smaller banks. These are often of shorter-than-usual durations due to uncertainties over the rate, economic and market outlooks. And that is painful: The spread between three-month and three-year government debt is 0.35 percentage point, a third of its long-term average. Given this, bank investors face a long, cold wait for the gains that will come from any upturn in rates. -- David Reilly Lumia Shows The Old Scars Still at Nokia It wasn't the bloodbath many had feared. Nokia's 1.1 billion euros ($1.44 billion) full-year loss and 9% sales slump lifted its shares slightly Thursday. The launch of its new ""Lumia"" Windows Phones is on track. But there are some ugly scars from its old product range. Earnings expectations for Nokia were low. Weak sales forecasts by one of its main chip suppliers, ST Ericsson, caused its shares to fall 5% earlier in the week. Nokia's biggest achievement in the last quarter was the launch, on schedule, of two Windows-based smartphones. It has sold over a million across 15 markets -- a decent beginning. Nokia hopes these phones will allow it to compete with Apple and Google, and drive a return to 10% operating margins in coming years, from 3% at present. Nokia admits it must do a better job accelerating product launches and training retail staff to promote its new phones. Windows Phone 7 had less than a 2% market share in the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K. at year-end, based on Kantar Worldpanel data. Average selling prices for Nokia's phones continue to fall. This quarter, it believes operating margins could turn negative. Meanwhile, its old ""Symbian"" smartphone range, estimated to make up over a third of phone sales, is losing ground. Its prior expectation of selling 150 million in coming years has been abandoned. Nokia is under pressure from very low-price devices in markets like China, where its Symbian phones don't run on the CDMA technology that local operators now prefer. Nokia also has a much higher share than rivals of the nonsmart-phones, forecast to shrink. Nokia booked a 1.1 billion euros impairment in the fourth quarter, as it revalued its mapping division. Its loss-making joint venture Nokia Siemens Networks is being restructured this year. Trading at 12 times forecast 2013 earnings, Nokia's shares look fully valued, notes S&P. Particularly given the battles it faces ahead. -- Hester Plumridge Reality Can Bite Private-Equity Investors Europe's private-equity investors may have their heads in the sand. Most expect net annual returns of 11%-15% from their portfolio in coming years, notes Coller Capital, even though roughly half admit they hold funds where managers have no prospect of earning performance fees. A wake-up call may be ahead. Private equity has yet to tackle past demons. Funds raised between 2005 and 2008 hold roughly half of the industry capital raised globally since the 1960s, estimates fund-raising group Triago. Much of this is either still to be spent, or still invested in companies bought at peak valuations. Many will be ""zombie"" funds, where managers will never meet the minimum 8% annual return needed to earn a share of profits. That presents an incentive to hold on to investments and keep earning management fees even as returns dwindle. Average internal rates of return for European funds raised between those dates are currently just 4.5%, estimates Preqin. Sure, European funds' average internal rates of return over the previous 10 years are nearer 14%. Last year, the total value of private-equity deals across Europe grew 7% as average deal size rose, according to estimates from the Centre for Management Buyout Research. Funds say debt financing is available for good acquisitions. Bank deleveraging should result in the sale of noncore business or loan books in coming years. Some funds expect to benefit from a long-awaited shake-out of industry players. But the outlook remains challenging. The majority of deals last year were companies changing private-equity owners. Banks remain reluctant to sell assets at a discount and crystallize losses. Funds are putting up to 65% equity in deals, versus up to 40% (and often much less) earlier this decade. Prices for leveraged buyouts remain high at 8.8 times Ebitda, according to S&P data. That could continue as funds globally compete to invest an estimated $385 billion of uninvested capital, roughly half of which must be spent or returned to investors before 2014. Still, the majority of European investors polled believe 2012 will be good or excellent for private equity. That may prove the triumph of hope over experience. -- Hester Plumridge Overheard More than a year into the Arab spring, Tunisia has emerged as a winner -- at least in stock-market terms. Since Dec. 17, 2010, when the uprising in Tunisia started, its stock market has fallen 9% in local-currency terms, a better performance than all but Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Palestine Securities Exchange among Middle Eastern and North African bourses, according to data from Religare Capital. In dollar terms, Tunisian stocks are down 12.2%, far better than Egyptian stocks' 42.4% slump and Syrian shares' 60% collapse. Tunisia has been lucky to come through its revolution earlier than such countries. The country still faces headwinds, not least from Europe, which consumes exports worth 25% of Tunisia's GDP and provides most of its tourists. But the fact that Tunisia's biggest economic problems now are as much external as internal makes a welcome change. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,One-Billion-Euro Loss and a Silver Lining for Nokia,"Nokia, the world’s largest seller of mobile phones by volume, said Thursday that it suffered a huge loss in the fourth quarter but reported better-than-expected sales of its new Windows smartphones, sending its shares soaring. Nokia said it lost almost 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of 745 million euros a year earlier. Sales at Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, fell 21 percent to 10 billion euros from 12.65 billion euros a year earlier. Operating profit shrank by more than half during the period to 478 million euros, from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. But shares of Nokia rose sharply in Helsinki trading after the company reported that it had already sold more than a million Lumia phones, the first using the Windows operating system, since October. Nokia is currently selling two Windows models, the Lumia 800 in Europe and parts of Asia, and the Lumia 710 in the United States. “The results suggest a good start for the Nokia Windows phones,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst in London at International Data Corporation. He said that other makers of Windows phones, like Samsung and HTC, were also benefiting from Nokia’s promotion of the operating system. “The massive marketing investment to promote the Nokia Lumia 800 contributed to ship better-than-expected volumes.” Stephen Elop, the former Microsoft executive who is directing Nokia’s transition from its own Symbian operating system to Windows, said the company planned to widen its aggressive selling of Windows devices, which I.D.C. estimates had only a 1 percent share of the global operating system market in the fourth quarter, far behind the leading operating systems: Android, made by Google, and iOS, made by Apple. “From this beachhead of more than one million Lumia devices, you will see us push forward with the sales, marketing and successive product introductions necessary to be successful,” Mr. Elop said. The company announced plans to sell a third Windows phone, the Lumia 900, through AT&T Mobility in the United States. Mr. Elop said Nokia would also start selling Lumia devices in China and Latin America by June. He said the Windows operating system and its associated services, which he refers to as a software-hardware “ecosystem,” are being embraced by operators who want a credible rival to Apple and Android, which together had more than three quarters of the global smartphone operating system market in the fourth quarter, according to I.D.C. “In the war of ecosystems, clearly there are some strong contenders already on the field,” Mr. Elop said. “With Lumia, we have demonstrated that we belong on the field. Our specific intent has been to establish a beachhead in this war of ecosystems, and country by country, that is what we are now accomplishing.” But as Nokia navigates the transition to Windows, it is suffering financially, as operators abandon or demand price cuts on Symbian models, which still make up the vast majority of the 113.5 million phones Nokia sold in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the number sold declined by 8 percent from 123.7 million a year earlier. The average selling price of a Symbian phone slid 23 percent to 53 euros in the quarter, from 69 euros one year earlier. Sales fell 38 percent in Europe, Nokia’s largest market, and 40 percent in China, its third-largest market, during the quarter. In North America, Symbian sales dived 77 percent to 53 million units from 233 million a year earlier. Mr. Elop said Symbian devices were being undercut by lower-priced smartphones. Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE sell basic smartphones for less than $100. “In certain markets, there has been an acceleration of the anticipated trend towards lower-priced smartphones with specifications that are different from Symbian’s traditional strengths.” Mr. Elop said Nokia expected to sell fewer Symbian devices than originally anticipated when he announced the decision to adopt Windows in February 2011. At the time, Mr. Elop predicted Nokia would sell 150 million Symbian devices as Nokia ramped up production and made the transition to Windows phones. On Thursday, he said Nokia would sell fewer, without being more precise. Nokia began selling its first Windows model, the Lumia 800, in October in some markets in Europe and Asia. This month, it began selling Lumia 710 through T-Mobile. Analysts are expecting Nokia to rapidly reassert its relevance in the smartphone market, which it had largely to itself before the 2007 introduction of Apple’s first iPhone. Over the next 12 months, Nokia will expand its smartphone market share more than sixfold, to 12.2 percent, overtaking Research in Motion, the makers of the BlackBerry, according to I.D.C. By 2015, Windows and Nokia will be the world’s second-largest smartphone operating system, I.D.C. estimates, with 21 percent, trailing Google’s Android, with 47 percent, but ahead of Apple, with 19 percent. “What people are underestimating is how much operators in Europe and elsewhere are beginning to support and push Windows phones,” Mr. Jeronimo said in an interview. “Operators are very afraid of becoming dependent on the Android-Apple duopoly, and as a result, they are pushing Nokia devices aggressively on the public.” The New York Times Company Document NYTFEED020120302e81r001ej ",NYTimes.com Feed,27 January 2012,902 words,onebillioneuro loss silver lining nokia,nokia world largest seller mobile phone volume said thursday suffered huge loss fourth reported betterthanexpected sale new window smartphones sending share soaring nokia lost almost billion euro compared profit year earlier nokia based espoo finland fell percent operating shrank half period nokia rose sharply helsinki trading company already sold lumia first using system since october nokia currently selling two model lumia europe asia lumia united result suggest good nokia francisco jeronimo analyst london international data corporation maker like samsung htc also benefiting nokias promotion massive investment promote nokia lumia contributed betterthanexpected stephen elop microsoft executive directing nokias transition symbian planned widen aggressive device idc estimate market far behind leading android made google io apple beachhead one lumia see u forward successive product introduction necessary successful mr elop announced third lumia att mobility mr elop nokia lumia china latin america june associated service refers softwarehardware ecosystem embraced operator want credible rival together three smartphone according idc war clearly strong field mr elop lumia demonstrated belong specific intent country accomplishing nokia navigates suffering financially abandon demand price cut symbian still majority nokia number declined average symbian slid europe nokias largest thirdlargest north america symbian dived unit mr elop symbian lowerpriced smartphones chinese huawei zte basic smartphones le certain acceleration anticipated towards lowerpriced smartphones specification different symbians traditional strength mr elop nokia expected fewer symbian decision february time mr elop predicted nokia symbian nokia ramped thursday nokia without precise nokia began lumia october europe asia month began lumia tmobile expecting nokia rapidly reassert relevance smartphone largely iphone next nokia expand smartphone sixfold overtaking research motion blackberry idc nokia secondlargest smartphone idc trailing people underestimating much europe elsewhere mr jeronimo interview afraid becoming dependent androidapple duopoly pushing nokia york document nytfeederej
201201,Apple Claimed Smartphone Lead in Fourth Quarter,"HONG KONG—Apple Inc. overtook Samsung Electronics Co. as the world's biggest smartphone maker in the fourth quarter thanks to robust iPhone 4S sales. But data from two research firms Friday showed that the South Korean company became the biggest smartphone brand for all of 2011, highlighting the intense competition as the two companies wrestle for the top spot. Samsung of South Korea had displaced Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., to take the No. 1 rank in smartphones in the July-September quarter, after customers waited on the sidelines for the new iPhone 4S with voice-recognition capability to hit the market. But Apple earlier this month reported record profit and sales for the quarter thanks in part to strong sales of iPhones. The company said it sold 37 million units. Samsung doesn't disclose smartphone sales figures, but research firm Strategy Analytics said Friday that Samsung shipped 36.5 million units during the October-December period, giving it a market share of 23.5%, slightly behind Apple's 23.9%. The news comes as the two technology companies are embroiled in patent litigation across the globe after Apple accused Samsung last year of copying the iPhone and iPad designs. Samsung countersued, alleging Apple violated various patents related to its telecommunications standards. ""Apple and Samsung continue to run neck-and-neck in global smartphone shipments, setting up a tight battle for leadership that will continue throughout 2012,"" said Wayne Lam, senior analyst at market-research firm IHS iSuppli. ""Samsung advanced tremendously in 2011 because of its strategy of offering a complete line of smartphone products, spanning a variety of price points, features and operating systems. This enabled Samsung to move past perennial market leader Nokia and to slightly exceed Apple's total for the year."" Nokia Corp., the world's biggest cellphone maker by volume, shipped 19.6 million smartphones in the quarter, putting it in third place with a market share of 12.6%. Nokia's share of the market slipped from 28.1% a year earlier as a lackluster touchscreen smartphone portfolio and limited presence in the large U.S. market caused market share losses, Strategy Analytics said. ""Nokia's partnership with Microsoft will be very much in focus during 2012, and the industry will be watching closely to see how swiftly the two companies can expand in the high-value 4G LTE market that is rapidly emerging across the United States, Japan and elsewhere,"" Tom Kang, a director at Strategy Analytics said. LTE, which stands for long-term evolution, is a fourth-generation wireless technology that promises faster downloads than 3G technology. Strategy Analytics said global smartphone shipments grew 54% to a record 155 million units in the fourth quarter. According to IHS iSuppli, Sony Ericsson ranked in fourth place with six million units, while Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. came in fifth place with five million units. For all of 2011, Strategy Analytics said Samsung sold 97.4 million smartphones, giving it a share of 19.9%, ahead of Apple's 93 million units, or 19.0% share.

201201,Nintendo Reports a Loss and Warns of Worse to Come,"TOKYO—Grappling with a sluggish debut for its new hand-held game system and petering demand for its flagship home console, Nintendo Co. swung to a loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year and scaled back sales forecasts for its 3DS portable system and Wii. The Kyoto-based videogame maker also offered an even bleaker outlook for its full-year earnings for the year to March, saying Thursday that net losses will be three times greater than its projections in October as valuation losses on foreign-currency holdings from the strong yen continued to swell. The loss comes as Nintendo is replacing aging videogame machines with new ones, while trying to cope with the technological change in the industry, specifically smartphones and tablet computers offering simple-to-play games at a fraction of the price of games available on dedicated game machines such as the 3DS. For the full-year ending March, Nintendo expects a net loss of ¥65 billion on revenue of ¥660 billion. It had been projecting a loss of ¥20 billion yen on revenue of ¥790 billion. Nintendo's Wii game system was once a champion on the market but its popularity has waned. A successor, the Wii U, is set to come out later this year. Last February Nintendo introduced the 3DS, a hand-held game system with the ability to play 3-D games without the need for special glasses, but the initial consumer response was weak. To kick-start demand, Nintendo slashed the price of the 3DS by 40% in August. In the run-up to the holiday shopping season, Nintendo also introduced 3DS versions of two popular game franchises, with ""Super Mario 3D Land"" and ""Mario Kart 7."" Nintendo doesn't break out figures on a quarterly basis, but price cuts made to its 3DS and some new software titles sparked some demand for the portable game machine during the three months ended December. Based on calculations from Nintendo's figures, it sold 8.36 million 3DS units during the October-December period, or more than the company had sold in its previous three quarters combined. Still, sales of the 3DS fell short of Nintendo's expectation. The company said it is now targeting sales of 14 million 3DS units, short of its October target to sell 16 million, for this fiscal year. For the Wii, it is now projecting sales of 10 million units, a 20% reduction from its prior estimates. For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Nintendo posted a net loss of ¥48.35 billion ($621.6 million), swinging from a year-earlier profit of ¥49.56 billion. On an operating basis, Nintendo had a loss of ¥16.41 billion. Revenue fell 31.2% to ¥556.17 billion. Compounding Nintendo's losses is a stubbornly strong yen. The Japanese currency is hovering near records. Nintendo keeps much of its cash in foreign currencies, so the yen's rise inflates the paper losses on its reserves. Similarly, the company also incurs paper gains when the Japanese currency weakens. The company said it incurred foreign-exchange losses of ¥53.7 billion for the nine-month period. Nintendo changed its foreign-exchange rate expectations for this fiscal year, lowering its assumption for the euro to ¥98 from ¥106. For the dollar, it maintained its assumption at ¥77. In Thursday trading in Tokyo, Nintendo shares slipped ¥70, or 0.65%, ¥10,780. Write to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,"AT&T Stuck Behind Verizon; In Race to Win New Contract Customers, AT&T Falls Short in Latest Quarter","AT&T Inc. sold its highest level of smartphones during the holiday quarter, but the phone giant is still lagging behind Verizon Wireless in the race to win new contract customers and draw even more revenue from them. AT&T said Thursday it added 717,000 customers with lucrative two-year contracts in the fourth quarter, a 79% jump from a year earlier, on the strength of 7.6 million iPhone activations and 9.4 million smartphone sales overall. But the second largest wireless carrier is adding fewer contract customers than bigger rival Verizon Wireless, which brought in 1.2 million such subscribers in the same period despite fewer smartphone activations. Most of AT&T's iPhone and smartphone sales are going to existing subscribers. AT&T is also behind in another key metric—growth in average revenue per user, or ARPU—which was 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with 2.5% for Verizon Wireless. AT&T did end the year with a lead in ARPU, bringing in $63.76 per month compared with Verizon Wireless' $54.80. As the carriers duke it out for a dwindling number of available customers, the need to pull more money from subscribers will become increasingly important. AT&T took a step in that direction this month by raising the price of smartphone and tablet data plans by $5. An AT&T spokeswoman said the higher-priced data plans should help drive ARPU this year, as will the move by customers upgrading to smartphones. ""We also get more than $6 more in postpaid ARPUs than any of our competitors,"" she added. Even with the shift to data-heavy smartphones, carriers' ARPU isn't growing as fast as they'd like because they're struggling to maintain revenue from voice usage. Craig Moffett, an analyst at research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, estimates AT&T recorded a 6.2% drop in monthly average revenue from voice services last quarter from a year earlier, the company's biggest decline, he said. AT&T doesn't break out this number. AT&T said Thursday it is targeting a 2% lift to ARPU this year, while Verizon Wireless vowed this week to grow the measure by at least 2.5%. In the fourth quarter, AT&T posted a $6.68 billion loss due to one-time costs—notably a $4 billion charge for its failed T-Mobile USA takeover bid. The carrier also contributed $1 billion to its pension plan. Revenue rose 3.6% to $32.5 billion. Like Verizon Wireless, AT&T's wireless profit margins suffered due to hefty outlays for subsidizing the iPhone and other handsets upfront in exchange for two-year customer commitments. The carrier reported its wireless service margin, not including some expenses, fell to 28.7% from 37.6%. The fourth-quarter margin was 42.2% at Verizon Wireless, a venture jointly owned by Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. AT&T also saw a spike in the rate at which customers leave its network. That measure, known as churn, rose to 1.39% in the quarter from 1.32% a year earlier. Verizon Wireless pared churn to 1.23% from 1.26% in the prior period. To keep pace with Verizon Wireless after pulling its $39 billion T-Mobile bid, AT&T will need to focus on the rollout of its fourth-generation mobile network. AT&T's 4G LTE network covers just over a third of the number of Americans as its competitor, and the company is growing more reliant on Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which operates only on 3G networks, to draw long-term customers. ""In 2012, we expect to double our LTE coverage,"" Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a conference call with analysts. That would take AT&T's 4G coverage to about 150 million Americans, still 50 million fewer than Verizon Wireless today. Stephens said AT&T expects to dial up about 25 million smartphone sales this year, about the same as in 2011, which was a record for the carrier. Late last year, AT&T walked away from its deal for T-Mobile after battling for nine months against resistance from the Justice Department, Federal Communications Commission, state attorneys general and some competitors. The companies said they would enter a seven-year roaming agreement and seek new ways to bolster their cellular networks. On Thursday's call Chief Executive Randall Stephenson blasted the FCC, faulting the agency for standing in the way of industry growth by failing to organize an auction for spectrum licenses and for opposing the T-Mobile deal. ""This FCC made it abundantly clear that they'll not allow significant M&A to help bridge and free up spectrum,"" Stephenson said. ""The FCC is intent on picking winners and losers rather than letting these markets work."" Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@dowjones.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,Nokia Discerns Hope in New Phone,"HELSINKI—In the first test of Nokia Corp.'s turnaround plan, the handset maker said sales of its first Windows smartphones were off to a good start even as its overall shipments continued to slide. Chief Executive Stephen Elop said Nokia sold well over one million of its new Windows-based Lumia handsets to date. He pledged to bring the Lumia series to additional markets including China and Latin America in the first half of 2012 to further boost sales. Despite the introduction of the Lumia, Nokia's overall smartphone shipments fell 31% to 19.6 million in the holiday quarter. By comparison, Apple Inc. said iPhone shipments more than doubled to 37 million in the same period from a year earlier. Mr. Elop last year embarked on a strategy to use Windows software to regain market share, after his company struggled to compete with the iPhone and smartphones using Google Inc.'s Android software with its Symbian software. On Thursday, he said that due to competition from Chinese manufacturers in particular, the company would sell fewer Symbian smartphones than originally planned. Sales in Nokia's key Devices & Services unit fell 29% to around €6 billion in the quarter, as average handset prices declined to €53 from €69 a year ago. Nokia's feature-phone units slipped 1% to 93.9 million. The company said its Devices & Services profit would be ""around break-even"" for the first quarter. ""While we progressed in the right direction in 2011, we still have a tremendous amount to accomplish in 2012 in order to properly position Nokia for sustainable long-term growth,"" Mr. Elop said on a conference call to analysts. ""We are now in the heart of our transition."" The world's largest handset maker by volume swung to a €1.07 billion ($1.4 billion) loss for the three months ended Dec. 31, down from a €745 million profit in the same period last year. Nokia's results were dragged down by €1.43 billion in charges and write downs. The company posted €10 billion in sales, down 21% from a year earlier. Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said Nokia's shipments were in line with expectations. ""Overall, what we have been looking for is an improvement over the third quarter, and we got that. But while it seems Nokia is on track, there is still a lot more to do,"" she said. Nokia Siemens Networks, the joint venture between Nokia and Germany's Siemens AG, posted a €67 million operating profit in the quarter on sales of €3.82 billion, down 4% from a year ago. In a separate announcement, Nokia said it would propose that director Risto Siilasmaa replace Jorma Ollila as chairman of the company's board. Mr. Ollila said in 2010 that he would step down as chairman this year. The board will also propose a dividend of €0.20 per share be paid for the fiscal year 2011.

201201,Lumia Shines as Nokia Sales Fall,"Corrections & Amplifications Nokia Corp. has sold more than one million of its new Windows-based Lumia handsets to date. A Business & Finance article in the Friday-Sunday edition incorrectly stated the company had sold that amount in the fourth quarter. (WSJE Jan. 30, 2012) (END) HELSINKI -- In the first test of Nokia Corp.'s turnaround plan, the handset maker said sales of its first Windows smartphones were off to a good start even as its overall shipments continued to slide. Chief Executive Stephen Elop said Nokia sold well over one million of its new Windows-based Lumia handsets in the fourth quarter. He pledged to bring the Lumia series to additional markets including China and Latin America in the first half of 2012 to further boost sales. Despite the introduction of the Lumia, Nokia's overall smartphone shipments fell 31% to 19.6 million in the holiday quarter. By comparison, Apple Inc. said iPhone shipments more than doubled to 37 million in the same period from a year earlier. Mr. Elop last year embarked on a strategy to use Windows software to regain market share, after his company struggled to compete with its Symbian software against the iPhone and smartphones using Google Inc.'s Android software. On Thursday, he said that due to competition from Chinese manufacturers in particular, the company would sell fewer Symbian smartphones than originally planned. Sales in Nokia's key Devices & Services unit fell 29% to around 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in the quarter, as average handset prices declined to 53 euros from 69 euros a year ago. Nokia's feature-phone units slipped 1% to 93.9 million. The company said its Devices & Services profit would be ""around break-even"" for the first quarter. ""While we progressed in the right direction in 2011, we still have a tremendous amount to accomplish in 2012 in order to properly position Nokia for sustainable long-term growth,"" Mr. Elop said on a conference call to analysts. ""We are now in the heart of our transition."" The world's largest handset maker by volume swung to a 1.07 billion euro ($1.4 billion) loss for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a 745 million euro profit in the year-earlier quarter. Nokia's results were dragged down by 1.43 billion euros in charges and write-downs. The company posted 10 billion euros in sales, down 21% from a year earlier. Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said Nokia's shipments were in line with expectations. ""Overall, what we have been looking for is an improvement over the third quarter, and we got that. But while it seems Nokia is on track, there is still a lot more to do,"" she said. Nokia Siemens Networks, the joint venture between Nokia and Germany's Siemens AG, posted a 67 million euro operating profit in the quarter on sales of 3.82 billion euros, down 4% from a year ago. In a separate announcement, Nokia said it would propose that director Risto Siilasmaa replace Jorma Ollila as chairman of the company's board. Mr. Ollila said in 2010 that he would step down as chairman this year. The board will also propose a dividend of 0.20 euros per share be paid for the fiscal year 2011.

201201,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Monday: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Tuesday: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Wednesday: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. predicts it will start the new year with a surprisingly strong quarter. The outlook helps assure investors that LSI is past the problems caused by the hard disk shortages, which had threatened to have ripple effects on LSI's semiconductors for data storage and networking. Thursday: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. Marvell Technology lowers its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, citing Thailand flooding and weak year-end demand among mobile and wireless customers. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Monday: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Tuesday: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Wednesday: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Thursday: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of (EURO)1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a (EURO)1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of (EURO)745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown.

201201,A Billion-Euro Loss for Nokia,"Nokia, the world's largest seller of mobile phones by volume, said Thursday that it suffered a huge loss in the fourth quarter but reported better-than-expected sales of its new Windows smartphones, sending its shares soaring. Nokia said it lost almost 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of 745 million euros a year earlier. Sales at Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, fell 21 percent to 10 billion euros from 12.65 billion euros a year earlier. Operating profit shrank by more than half during the period to 478 million euros, from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. But shares of Nokia rose sharply in Helsinki trading after the company reported that it had already sold more than a million Lumia phones, the first using the Windows operating system, since October. Nokia is currently selling two Windows models, the Lumia 800 in Europe and parts of Asia, and the Lumia 710 in the United States. ''The results suggest a good start for the Nokia Windows phones,'' said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst in London at International Data Corporation. He said that other makers of Windows phones, like Samsung and HTC, were also benefiting from Nokia's promotion of the operating system. ''The massive marketing investment to promote the Nokia Lumia 800 contributed to ship better-than-expected volumes.'' Stephen Elop, the former Microsoft executive who is directing Nokia's transition from its own Symbian operating system to Windows, said the company planned to widen its aggressive selling of Windows devices, which I.D.C. estimates had only a 1 percent share of the global operating system market in the fourth quarter, far behind the leading operating systems: Android, made by Google, and iOS, made by Apple. ''From this beachhead of more than one million Lumia devices, you will see us push forward with the sales, marketing and successive product introductions necessary to be successful,'' Mr. Elop said. The company announced plans to sell a third Windows phone, the Lumia 900, through AT&T Mobility in the United States. Mr. Elop said Nokia would also start selling Lumia devices in China and Latin America by June. He said the Windows operating system and its associated services, which he refers to as a software-hardware ''ecosystem,'' are being embraced by operators who want a credible rival to Apple and Android, which together had more than three quarters of the global smartphone operating system market in the fourth quarter, according to I.D.C. ''In the war of ecosystems, clearly there are some strong contenders already on the field,'' Mr. Elop said. ''With Lumia, we have demonstrated that we belong on the field. Our specific intent has been to establish a beachhead in this war of ecosystems, and country by country, that is what we are now accomplishing.'' But as Nokia navigates the transition to Windows, it is suffering financially, as operators abandon or demand price cuts on Symbian models, which still make up the vast majority of the 113.5 million phones Nokia sold in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the number sold declined by 8 percent from 123.7 million a year earlier. The average selling price of a Symbian phone slid 23 percent to 53 euros in the quarter, from 69 euros one year earlier. Sales fell 38 percent in Europe, Nokia's largest market, and 40 percent in China, its third-largest market, during the quarter. In North America, Symbian sales dived 77 percent to 53 million units from 233 million a year earlier. Mr. Elop said Symbian devices were being undercut by lower-priced smartphones. Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE sell basic smartphones for less than $100. ''In certain markets, there has been an acceleration of the anticipated trend towards lower-priced smartphones with specifications that are different from Symbian's traditional strengths.'' Mr. Elop said Nokia expected to sell fewer Symbian devices than originally anticipated when he announced the decision to adopt Windows in February 2011. At the time, Mr. Elop predicted Nokia would sell 150 million Symbian devices as Nokia ramped up production and made the transition to Windows phones. On Thursday, he said Nokia would sell fewer, without being more precise. Nokia began selling its first Windows model, the Lumia 800, in October in some markets in Europe and Asia. This month, it began selling Lumia 710 through T-Mobile. Analysts are expecting Nokia to rapidly reassert its relevance in the smartphone market, which it had largely to itself before the 2007 introduction of Apple's first iPhone. Over the next 12 months, Nokia will expand its smartphone market share more than sixfold, to 12.2 percent, overtaking Research in Motion, the makers of the BlackBerry, according to I.D.C. By 2015, Windows and Nokia will be the world's second-largest smartphone operating system, I.D.C. estimates, with 21 percent, trailing Google's Android, with 47 percent, but ahead of Apple, with 19 percent. ''What people are underestimating is how much operators in Europe and elsewhere are beginning to support and push Windows phones,'' Mr. Jeronimo said in an interview. ''Operators are very afraid of becoming dependent on the Android-Apple duopoly, and as a result, they are pushing Nokia devices aggressively on the public.''

201201,"Nintendo's Woes Mount As 3DS, Wii Sales Falter","TOKYO -- Grappling with a sluggish debut for its new hand-held game system and ebbing demand for its flagship home console, Nintendo Co. posted a loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year and scaled back sales forecasts for its 3DS portable system and Wii. The Japanese videogame maker also offered a bleaker forecast for the full fiscal year ending in March, saying Thursday that its net loss will be three times as steep as its projections in October, as valuation losses on foreign-currency holdings stemming from the strong yen continue to swell. The nine-months loss comes as Nintendo is replacing aging videogame machines with new ones, while trying to cope with the technological change in the industry, specifically smartphones and tablet computers offering simple-to-play games at a fraction of the price of games available on dedicated game machines, such as the 3DS. For the full fiscal year, Nintendo expects a net loss of 65 billion yen ($836 million) on revenue of 660 billion yen. It had been projecting a loss of 20 billion yen on revenue of 790 billion yen. Nintendo's Wii game system was once a champion on the market but its popularity has waned. A successor, the Wii U, is set to come out later this year. Last February Kyoto-based Nintendo introduced the 3DS, a hand-held game system with the ability to play 3-D games without the need for special glasses, but the initial consumer response was weak. To kick-start demand, Nintendo slashed the price of the 3DS by 40% in August. In the run-up to the holiday shopping season, Nintendo also introduced 3DS versions of two popular game franchises, with ""Super Mario 3D Land"" and ""Mario Kart 7."" Nintendo doesn't break out figures on a quarterly basis, but price cuts on 3DS and some new software titles sparked some demand for the portable game machine during the three months ended in December. Based on calculations from Nintendo's figures, it sold 8.36 million 3DS units during the October-December period, or more than it had sold in its previous three quarters combined. Still, sales of the 3DS fell short of Nintendo's expectation. The company said it is now targeting sales of 14 million 3DS units, short of its October target to sell 16 million, for the current fiscal year. For the Wii, it is now projecting sales of 10 million units, a 20% reduction from its prior estimates. For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Nintendo posted a net loss of 48.35 billion yen, swinging from a year-earlier profit of 49.56 billion yen. On an operating basis, Nintendo had a loss of 16.41 billion yen. Revenue fell 31.2% to 556.17 billion yen. Compounding Nintendo's losses is a stubbornly strong yen. Nintendo keeps much of its cash in foreign currencies, so the yen's rise inflates the paper losses on its reserves. Similarly, the company also incurs paper gains when the Japanese currency weakens. The company said it incurred foreign-exchange losses of 53.7 billion yen for the nine-month period. Nintendo changed its foreign-exchange rate expectations for this fiscal year, lowering its assumption for the euro to 98 yen from 106 yen. For the dollar, it maintained its assumption at 77 yen.

201201,UPDATE 2-Wal-Mart puts U.S. marketing under merchandising,"* Walmart US marketing chief to report to merchandising chief * Walmart US sees need for better coordination of two units * No job cuts related to changes (Adds details on executives' roles, stock price) By Jessica Wohl Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Friday that its U.S. marketing team would now work under the leadership of its chief merchandising officer rather than as a separate group as the world's largest retailer works on improving its communication with shoppers. Under the new plan, Walmart U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Stephen Quinn will report to Walmart U.S. Chief Merchandising Officer Duncan Mac Naughton. Previously, Quinn reported directly to Bill Simon, the president and chief executive officer of the business. Mac Naughton, who is responsible for merchandising across Walmart's more than 3,850 U.S. stores, continues to report directly to Simon. The shift comes as Walmart sees a need for better coordination between the two groups. Shopping and advertising are being quickly transformed by the Internet, social media, smartphones and other shifts in both shoppers' behavior and reaching shoppers with the right campaigns. Walmart U.S. finally saw sales at existing stores grow during the fiscal third quarter after nine consecutive quarterly declines. Its efforts during the holiday season, such as offering a wider variety of merchandise, a price guarantee and bringing back a broader layaway plan, appeared to be successful, though quarterly results are not due until Feb. 21. Mac Naughton is familiar with running merchandising and marketing together. Before he joined Walmart in 2009, Mac Naughton was the executive vice president of merchandising and marketing at grocer Supervalu Inc. He has been chief merchandising officer of Walmart US for a year after serving in other merchandising roles.

201201,RPT-ANALYSIS-Asia may not be such easy pickings for Apple,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) BANGALORE/HONG KONG, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Investors in Apple Inc have a one-word answer for those who wonder whether this corporate juggernaut can maintain its phenomenal momentum in the years ahead: Asia. The iconic maker of the iPhone, iPad and iPod has barely scratched the surface of the region, home to around 60 percent of the world's population -- a fact that Apple itself alluded to in reporting an eye-popping set of earnings this week. Apple's numbers, which included a 70 percent jump in December-quarter revenues and a doubling in profits, actually excluded sales of its hottest new product, the iPhone 4S, from its biggest single potential market, China. The latest iPhone did not go on sale there until this month, and there were near-riots as demand immediately ran ahead of supply, with empty-handed shoppers throwing eggs at Apple's typically minimalist glass-fronted store in Beijing. And in China's long shadow, other virtually untapped Asian markets such as India and Indonesia are waiting to be conquered, together home to around 1.4 billion people. ""I want an iPhone because of the lifestyle, it's a trendy phone to have,"" says 19-year-old Dylan who works at a hip fashion boutique, The Goods Dept, in downtown Jakarta. Sporting a trendy haircut, a long pendant necklace, jeans and vintage Ray Ban sunglasses, he is typical of style-conscious consumers everywhere to whom Apple's sleek devices are not so much useful gadgets as essential fashion accessories. But Dylan, and hundreds of millions of other aspiring Apple customers from Jakarta to Shanghai to Mumbai, have a problem: they cannot afford to buy the main objects of their desire. At about $830, even the older iPhone 4 costs twice the monthly salary of a young foreign exchange dealer in Jakarta. That simple fact -- unaffordability across emerging Asia -- has begun to test faith in Apple's ability to maintain its torrid sales growth without a big foray into a new product category, like TV. Though its shares keep rising, its future earnings become cheaper: valued at about 30 times earnings a few years ago, Apple's stock now trades at half that multiple. As Apple waits for Asian incomes to catch up, there is a risk that savvy competitors, especially main rival Samsung Electronics Co, could catch it napping with cheaper products that are becoming better, and cooler. Indonesia remains a redoubt of Research in Motion Ltd's BlackBerry, largely because it is more affordable, according to those like Dylan who use it: ""If they (iPhones) got cheaper, I would consider buying one,"" he says matter-of-factly. Pricing is also an issue in India, where the smartphones of choice belong to Samsung, maker of the Galaxy, and to Nokia and RIM's BlackBerry. ""I would much rather have bought one but I didn't have enough money to buy it. It's as simple as that,"" said Soubhik Mukherjee, 26, a social-media marketing strategist in New Delhi. ""It's quite ridiculously priced in India ... I don't have that kind of disposable income."" Mukherjee plans to buy a smartphone next month and is considering a BlackBerry or a Samsung Galaxy. ""Apple's biggest strength till now has been the user interface. It is the sleekest phone possible, the possibilities, design, basically the App store ... But I guess now there is an alternative. Two years ago it wasn't there, but now it's there."" THE CULT OF APPLE Industry experts say Apple could develop a cheaper version of iPhone for the big Asian markets, without jeopardising its prodigious profit margins, but other obstacles would remain, such as compatibility of new products with local telecoms networks and how to distribute them. In China, for example, network technology is not sufficient to fully support iPhone and iPad capabilities, so some customers there cannot surf the Internet through either device unless they connect to a WiFi hotspot such as at a cafe or hotel. China's biggest service provider, China Mobile Ltd with more than 600 million subscribers, may not have matching technology in place commercially until late this year or 2013. Network problems also exist in India where 3G telecom services are only now starting to be rolled out, just as Apple prepares for the 4G revolution in its advanced markets. The pick-up of 3G in India has been slower than expected, partly due to high service prices but mainly because most Indians still use phones just to talk or send text messages. Internet browsing and making video calls are a technological world away for those living outside India's cities. Even after overcoming Asia's network challenges, Apple still needs to cater for the region's fondness for pre-paid phones. Consumers prefer not to sign up for 12-month or two-year contracts under which telecoms firms are more likely to subsidise the cost of an iPhone and help drive sales. ""I don't see the carriers subsidising the cost of the handset,"" said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at consultancy Gartner Inc. ""There's no money with the consumer, there's no money with the carriers ... When they (carriers) subsidise the cost of the handset, they will have to pay Apple the money upfront."" DON'T WORRY, JUST WAIT Despite signs that Asia is not all low-hanging fruit, ripe for the picking by Apple, some industry analysts are confident the region's collective yearning for an iPhone will ultimately be satisfied, and Apple's profits will keep soaring as a result. China has more than 950 million mobile phone users, more than Europe's population, and its economy threatens to overtake the United States as the world's largest within 15 years. Barclays Capital says Apple's five stores in China and one in Hong Kong are its busiest and among its best revenue-generators on the planet, a hint of the potential in coming years as it confronts Samsung on its Asian home turf. Chinese demand is so strong that smuggling of real iPhones and sales of fakes are rising and copy-cat stores masquerading as real Apple outlets -- and selling genuine Apple products -- have sprouted up everywhere from Beijing to Kunming. ""Network incompatibility and those kind of issues will probably get resolved very quickly. I don't think that is an issue which could be a real hurdle,"" said Gokul Hariharan, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. ""Pricing, probably yes, would need to come down over time to enable market penetration, but I think for now the brand is basically viewed more like an aspirational brand... Even 10 to 15 percent penetration is actually quite a high number."" Around the region, Apple distributors are finding novel ways to ease the burden of buying an iPhone or an iPad. Croma, an Indian electronics store chain store owned by the Tata Group, is offering a WiFi-only version of the iPad 2 for a down-payment of just 2,458 rupees ($50) with the rest due in 12 equal monthly instalments. Currently, though, Apple's overall sales in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding the mature market of Japan, account for less than a fifth of group sales and the penetration of the iPhone, its top seller, trails behind its biggest rival, Samsung. For some analysts, this is Apple's biggest risk: while it waits for Asians to scrimp and save for an iPhone or an iPad, these consumers instead develop a taste and a loyalty to other products such as Samsung's Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Apple's share of the smartphone market has more than doubled in China since the first quarter of 2010, but Samsung, which recently passed Apple as the world's top smartphone maker, has meanwhile seen its share more than quadruple. Apple stole back its global lead with sales of 37 million iPhones in the December quarter, more than double its sales from a year earlier, versus 36.5 million smartphone sales for Samsung, according to [20120127 125257 GMT] research firm Strategy Analytics. But other hungry competitors are also aggressively targeting China and eyeing other new Asian markets. China's own Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp and are producing smartphones for less than 2,000 yuan ($320), half the price of a basic iPhone 4. APPLE ENVY Apple's new boss, Tim Cook, who took over as chief executive shortly before founder Steve Jobs died in October, is targeting China aggressively and has indicated that Apple's experience there could help it to penetrate other new Asian markets. Apple has hinted that adding carriers is probably one way to expand in these countries, but no announcements have been made. ""I have tried to be very clear in the past, and I will do so again, that we have a ton more energy in the China market today,"" Cook said in presenting Apple's results on Tuesday. ""China is an extremely important market for us and we continue to look at how to grow it further."" Some analysts say Apple needs to hasten its Asian expansion, developing cheaper handsets and working with more telecoms carriers in the region, but confidence remains high that it can conquer new markets and keep the juggernaut rolling. In Indonesia, consumers like shop assistant Dylan will be waiting for it. ""The chance for Apple to dominate the market is there, perhaps over three years from now as our GDP per capita is increasing and the iPhone price is going down,"" said Harry Su, head of research at Jakarta-based PT Bahana Securities. ""I'm sure many Indonesians would love to buy an iPhone.""

201201,"UPDATE 4-Prem Watsa's Fairfax ups RIM stake, shares rise","* Fairfax stake on par with holdings of former CEOs * Prem Watsa's firm holds 5.12 pct, up from 2.25 pct * Fairfax CEO Watsa named to RIM board this week * Shuffle may weaken hand of Jaguar's informal group * RIM shares rise 2.9 pct (Adds impact of shuffle on Jaguar-led group) By Cameron French and Alastair Sharp TORONTO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Fairfax Financial , the firm controlled by investor Prem Watsa, has more than doubled its stake in Research in Motion, a vote of confidence in the struggling BlackBerry maker that drove RIM's shares up nearly 3 percent on Friday. The purchase, revealed in a U.S. regulatory filing, gives Fairfax a holding on par with longtime co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie. Watsa, Fairfax's reclusive CEO and a highly-regarded investment mind, was appointed to the struggling BlackBerry maker's board this week as part of a front office shakeup in which Balsillie and Lazaridis stepped down from their roles at the company's helm. ""I think it's a good confidence booster,"" Ian Nakamoto, director of research at Toronto broker MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier, said of the share purchase, which gives Fairfax 5.12 percent of RIM. That is worth just under $450 million at Friday's prices. RIM's largest shareholder is U.S. money manager Primecap Management Co, with a 5.54 percent stake. Balsillie and Lazaridis hold 5.09 percent and 5.05 percent, respectively, according to Reuters data. Fairfax had held 2.25 percent of the company as of the end of September. CREDIBILITY Watsa, an Indian-born Canadian who took control of Fairfax in 1985, has built a reputation as a shrewd value investor in the mold of U.S. investor Warren Buffett. He made billions for the company by correctly calling the 2008 U.S. mortgage crisis, and he has been willing to make contrarian investments, such as last year's purchase of a 9 percent stake in troubled Bank of Ireland. ""It means a very astute, very deep-value investor has the sense that this is a company that's going to continue to play a role in the global smartphone market and is ridiculously cheap,"" said Paul Taylor, chief investment officer for BMO Harris Private Banking. That said, he suggested Watsa's involvement may only go so far in restoring the company's lost momentum. RIM is due to deliver updated software for its poorly selling PlayBook tablet next month and plans to launch smartphones using the PlayBook's QNX-based operating system later in the year. ""If they don't hit those milestones, they're dead in the water,"" Taylor said. RIM's Toronto-listed shares were up 48 Canadian cents at C$16.76 on Friday, making up some of the ground lost since the management shuffle was announced on Sunday. Investors have been cool on the appointment of Thorsten Heins as new CEO. Heins, RIM's former chief operating officer, is seen as an insider who may be unwilling or unable to reverse the decline in RIM's fortunes. The company's once-dominant position in the smartphone market has been eroded by competitors like Apple, and the stock is nearly 90 percent below its 2008 all-time high. ACTIVIST CAMPAIGN Even so, the departure of Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie from the helm could deflate an activist campaign for radical change led by Jaguar Financial's Vic Alboini, the public face of an ad-hoc alliance of Research In Motion investors. ""There may be members of that group that back away and allow the changes to work their way through the system,"" BMO Harris' Taylor said. But he added the shuffle could also embolden the secretive group as it seeks a breakup or outright sale at RIM. ""The changes that have taken place probably fuel the activist intervention in that they would claim some responsibility for the changes they did come to pass,"" he said. Alboini, who says his supporters have a total of about 10 percent of the shares, plans to hunker down for the long fight. Jaguar itself won't disclose how many shares of RIM it owns. ""This group is not going anywhere,"" Alboini, the CEO of tiny Northern Financial and its Jaguar Financial subsidiary, told Reuters soon after the news of the co-CEOs exit. ""It's early days."" TURNAROUND Watsa's arrival on the board has been a bit of an offset to the negative sentiment surrounding the CEO shuffle, although observers point out his reputation has been built largely on his market calls, rather than as a corporate turnaround artist. ""It makes for great news headlines, but just because Prem's investing in it doesn't mean it's a turnaround situation,"" said one analyst who did not want to be identified. While Fairfax has made wise moves such as selling much of its stock holdings ahead of the 1987 market crash and hedging itself against the Tokyo market's collapse in 1990, it had to write off most its investment in Winnipeg-based media company Canwest in 2009 as the company filed for bankruptcy protections. It also wrote down a significant investment in publisher Torstar in 2008-09 and took losses on its holding of forestry company Abitibi Bowater. ""His track record in terms of individual investments is maybe a bit spotty. Really where he's created the value over the years is through his macro calls,"" the analyst said. While the Bank of Ireland investment is still early days and it wasn't clear the price Fairfax paid for the stake, the bank's shares are up nearly 13 percent since Fairfax made the purchase in July.

201201,"UPDATE 3-Nintendo sees profit next year, but shares tumble","* Nintendo shares fall nearly 8 pct to 8-year low * Nintendo forecast first ever full-year operating loss * Game business under threat from iPhone, other gadgets * President says sees 3DS hardware losses ending in April-Sept * Nintendo denies age of handheld games device is over (Changes headline) By Isabel Reynolds TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Nintendo President Satoru Iwata dismissed the idea that the age of the dedicated handheld games device was over and said he aimed to return the company to substantial profit in 2012/13, after it warned of its first ever operating loss this year. Shares in Kyoto-based Nintendo Co Ltd tumbled nearly 8 percent to an 8-year low after it slashed its full-year guidance for the third time in 6 months, and analysts said the potential market for its products was shrinking rapidly. The creator of the Super Mario franchise reported a sharp drop in quarterly earnings, as its sales of its games devices that have dominated the industry for years were hit by competing gadgets such as Apple Inc's iPhone. Iwata said he blamed the dismal results on a mixture of strategic errors and the difficult business environment created by the strong yen and European consumer gloom. ""Nintendo is facing its worst results since it entered the games business. What matters now is how Nintendo can make a profit from next year onwards, even under these harsh conditions,"" he told an analysts' meeting. The maker of the Wii home console and DS handheld games is struggling to compete as sales of more versatile smartphones and tablets boom, and poor sales forced it to slash the price of its much anticipated 3DS handheld game device in August. ""The profitability of 3DS hardware was the biggest issue for earnings this financial year, but it looks like we'll be able to resolve the problem we've been having with losses on the 3DS during the first half of the next financial year,"" Iwata said. ""We should be able to generate a large profit by getting rid of losses on the 3DS hardware, if we can substantially lift sales of software."" A Nintendo spokesman said the company expected to stop losing money on each 3DS sold, thanks to economies of scale and changes to the internal design of the device. But Nintendo shares closed down 4.1 percent at 10,310 yen, after falling to 9,910 yen shortly after the market opened, their lowest since February 2004. It has lost nearly 60 percent of its value since the start of last year. ""The company's core handheld business is under assault from smartphones, iPods and tablets, and we see competition for consumer wallet share continuing,"" said analyst Michael Pachter of U.S.-based Wedbush Securities in a research note. ""The fact is that a significant share of Nintendo's market is gone forever, and we don't expect the company to come up with a practical strategy to stem the declines in sales we have forecast,"" he added. ""We do not expect the company's fortunes to turn in FY 13."" NEW HOME CONSOLE BY CHRISTMAS Nintendo said on Thursday its third-quarter operating profit fell 61 percent to 40.9 billion yen ($529 million) and it forecast an operating loss of 45 billion yen for the financial year to March 31, far worse than analysts' average forecast of a 4.2 billion yen loss. Sales of its 3DS slumped shortly after launch in February, forcing the company to slash prices just six months later and take a loss on each device, something it had prided itself on avoiding in the past. Even so, Nintendo cut its full-year 3DS sales forecast to 14 million from 16 million, while sales of its ageing Wii and the previous generation DS have fallen faster than expected. It also faces stiff competition in the home console market from Sony Corp's Move and Microsoft Corp's Kinect, and some analysts say the console market may dry up over the next several years as cloud gaming takes off. Nintendo will launch its Wii U console, a successor to the phenomenally successful Wii, in Japan, the United States, Australia and Europe at the year-end, after showing a final version at the E3 games show in June. But Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan, said the market was unlikely to have high hopes for the Wii U, although the slide in the share price may be reaching an end. ""The pace of the share price decline is easing and it may be near a floor, but it would be hard to predict a rapid recovery,"" he said. Iwata said a leap in 3DS sales after the launch of a raft of software late last year showed that dedicated handheld games gadgets still had a future. ""I believe we have disproved the extreme theory that there is no longer a demand for handheld devices,"" he said.

201201,"REFILE-UPDATE 2-Japan's NEC to slash 10,000 jobs, sees huge net loss","(In Jan. 26 story, corrects paragraph 3 to say that new forecast is much worse... ; adds title in paragraph 6) * To cut 10,000 jobs by Sept * Job losses concentrated in Japan mobile phone unit * Sees annual net loss of 100 bln yen * Smartphone sales hurt by iPhone competition * Foreign rivals squeezing IT business in Japan By Tim Kelly and Reiji Murai TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - NEC Corp said Thursday it will slash 10,000 jobs, almost one in 10 of its workers, in a bid to cut costs as competition from foreign rivals including Apple Inc pushes it deep into the red. NEC blamed its poor performance on weak demand for its smartphones amid the popularity of Apple's iPhone in Japan, as well as on inroads by foreign rivals into the domestic IT infrastructure business and difficulty in expanding overseas. It warned it would post a net loss of 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) for the year to March 31, much worse than its previous forecast of a 15 billion yen profit and a similar average estimate from eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the three months ended Dec. 31 it booked a net loss of 87 billion yen. It also slashed its projection for annual mobile phone sales by nearly a quarter to 5 million phones and most of the job cuts will be in its mobile phone business. Headcount will be reduced by the end of September and around 7,000 layoffs will be in Japan, NEC President Nobuhiro Endo said at a news conference in Tokyo. Endo said NEC will miss a target to raise overall sales to 4 trillion yen next business year but would still try to reach a goal of boosting its operating profit margin to 5 percent. The restructuring would result in a charge of 40 billion yen this financial year but would add 40 billion yen to income in the next financial year, Endo added. Shares of NEC finished unchanged from Wednesday's close at 168 yen. In the past 52 weeks, its shares have plummeted 32 percent.

201201,INSTANT VIEW 4-Samsung reports record Q4 profit on smartphones,"SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co , the world's top technology firm by revenue, reported a record quarterly profit on Friday, aided by its best-ever sales of smartphones and one-off gains. The South Korean firm reported a 5.3 trillion won ($4.72 billion) operating profit for the October-December quarter, broadly in line with its earlier estimate of 5.2 trillion won.

""Samsung will continue to post high growth in smartphone sales this year with around 150 million to 170 million shipments from below 100 million last year. But price competition will intensify, putting its handset margins under pressure."" BAIK JAE-YER, FUND MANAGER, KOREA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ""Prospects for Samsung are still optimistic. I think this year the smartphone market will expand to more mid-and low-end models that are affordable to the wider public."" ""Rather than focusing on market share, I would point out the strong contribution of Samsung's handset business to earnings growth and margins. The battle of the two big smartphone powers, Apple versus Samsung, will go on."" ""I don't think we can expect too much from the LCD market. The oversupply issue in panels won't resolve itself soon or easily."" ""Overall, this year Samsung's performance will improve the face of the U.S. economy turning around, which will boost global demand."" KIM YOUNG-CHAN, RESEARCH FELLOW, SHINHAN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES ""Apple had good sales this quarter but it is very unlikely this will be a trend that will overwhelm Samsung later. There were many end-of-the-year promotions and most importantly, effects from (Steve Jobs') death on sales growth can't be ruled out. It is unlikely that Samsung and Apple will fight over each other's shares of the market, but they will eat up the market share of smaller companies like HTC and RIM."" ""The DRAM market has shown a quick recovery and prices are rising as the production levels decrease. The turning point for the LCD market will likely be around March. With major events like the Olympics coming up, TV will provide an extra profit source for LCD makers."" AHN SEONG-HO, ANALYST, HANWHA SECURITIES ""Samsung's overall profit will decline in the current quarter, but will remain solid. Sales of smartphones and components used in the devices are strong, while the chip and display markets are bottoming out."" ""The smartphone market will continue to be a two-way race, not dominated by a single player. Samsung and Apple will compete closely for the top position."" WON SEO, ANALYST, KOREA INVESTMENT & SECURITIES ""Smartphone sales seem better than expected. In semiconductors, PC demand is still weak, and a late DRAM price rebound or sluggish growth could impact its results.""

201201,Samsung Advances on a New Front in Chips,"SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co .'s rapid ascent in smartphones got lots of attention last year, but the company is growing even faster in the market for chips inside the phones and is using that development to spring into the most challenging and lucrative part of the semiconductor industry. The South Korean company long has been the world's second-largest chip company, after Intel Corp ., using its manufacturing muscle to control nearly 50% of the market for memory chips that store data in devices. Samsung has been a smaller competitor in logic chips -- the ""brains"" of computers and other digital devices. But when Samsung releases its fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, it is expected to reveal a 2012 expansion plan that for the first time spends more money on logic chips than memory chips. Lee Jae-yun, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities in Seoul, says he expects Samsung to announce capital spending on chips of about $13.2 billion, with $7 billion allocated for logic chips. ""Samsung is coming on strong right now,"" says Will Strauss , an analyst at market-research firm Forward Concepts in Mesa, Ariz. It's a change that in large part reflects Samsung 's unique position as a designer, manufacturer and user of its own logic chips as well as a custom builder of chips for rivals and other customers. For example, Samsung manufactures chips designed by Apple Inc . that power the iPhone and the iPad, as well as those in Samsung mobile devices that compete with Apple's. There are solid financial reasons for the new emphasis. Prices of memory chips are notoriously volatile and, despite its dominant market position, Samsung hasn't been able to reap consistent earnings from them. Samsung 's memory-chip sales fell about 10% last year to roughly $23 billion, while its logic-chip sales increased around 70% to about $10 billion. That means the size of Samsung 's logic business now is approaching that of Texas Instruments Inc . and Qualcomm Inc . -- major providers of cellphone chips. Samsung 's business still is less than one-fourth the size of Intel 's, whose microprocessors are used in most personal computers. Samsung 's emergence in logic chips is occurring in circumstances that it has exploited before: a market undergoing a technological shift where leadership is unsettled. The company used the emergence of digital cameras to grab the lead in flash-memory chips that store data in them. It hopped on the change from tube television sets to flat-screen TVs to push aside Sony Corp . as the world's top maker of TVs. And Samsung is using the shift to smartphones to challenge Nokia Corp . as the leading maker of cellphones. Many analysts are expecting Samsung to surpass Nokia this year or next. Samsung declined requests to discuss the importance of its logic-chip business. Analysts say Samsung 's main challenge in logic chips is to differentiate the chips it designs from those made by companies already established in the market. One way has been to add memory functions, something Samsung has done with the main chips in its smartphones. And there are signs the company is beefing up its design expertise. The company in 2010 opened a research-and-development center in Austin, Texas, that now employs more than 100 people. It is led by Keith Hawkins, a veteran of microprocessor specialist Advanced Micro Devices Inc . More than a half-dozen other design specialists from AMD have joined the operation in the past year, according to profiles posted on LinkedIn. Samsung 's other challenge is balancing the manufacturing work it does for other logic-chip makers with its desire to sell its own such chips. Qualcomm , for example, competes with Samsung in smartphone chips but hires the Korean company to make some of them. Samsung hasn't revealed how much of its logic-chip revenue comes from building chips designed by others, known as foundry work. Analysts believe Samsung has three factories making logic chips designed by other companies and one plant for its own chips. Samsung last month said it reached maximum production at its newest logic-chip factory in Austin in just five months, a rapid ramp-up for a chip plant of any type. Analysts say the factory, which employs about 1,100 people, is producing the A5 chip used in Apple's latest devices. Samsung declines to comment on customers but it has pumped $9 billion into memory and logic production lines in Austin. While its investment in logic chips is reaching a turning point now, Samsung placed its bet on the business more than 10 years ago. The move prodded universities and vendors that provide the company with talent and equipment to do the same. Of the 30 professors teaching semiconductor-related classes at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 20 now teach about logic chips. ""This change didn't just happen in a day or a couple of years,"" says Kim Joung-ho, chairman of the electrical-engineering department at the school, South Korea's biggest science university. He said South Korea's government and technology educators long have known that developing skills in logic chips was in the long-term interests of the country and companies like Samsung . ""We want to build up the skills of Qualcomm and Intel in companies in Korea,"" Mr. Kim says. Samsung 's growth in logic chips is driving product development at Wonik IPS Co., a semiconductor-equipment manufacturer and Samsung supplier in suburban Seoul. ""We're interested because they're interested,"" says Chief Executive Lee Moon-yong. --- Don Clark in San Francisco contributed to this article. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Samsung 's business still is less than one-fourth the size of Intel 's, whose microprocessors are used in most personal computers. Samsung 's emergence in logic chips is occurring in circumstances that it has exploited before: a market undergoing a technological shift where leadership is unsettled. Samsung used the emergence of digital cameras to grab the lead in flash-memory chips that store data in them. It hopped on the shift from tube television sets to flat screens to best Sony Corp . as the world's top TV maker. And Samsung is using the shift to smartphones to challenge Nokia Corp . as the leading maker of cellphones. Samsung declined requests to discuss the importance of its logic-chip business. Analysts say Samsung 's main challenge in logic chips is to differentiate the chips it designs from those made by companies already established in the market. One way has been to add memory functions, something Samsung has done with the main chips in its smartphones. And there are signs the company is beefing up its design expertise. The company in 2010 opened a research-and-development center in Austin, Texas, that now employs more than 100 people. It is led by Keith Hawkins, a veteran of microprocessor specialist Advanced Micro Devices Inc . More than a half-dozen other design specialists from AMD have joined the operation in the past year, according to profiles posted on LinkedIn. Samsung 's other challenge is balancing the manufacturing work it does for other logic-chip makers with its desire to sell its own such chips. Qualcomm , for example, competes with Samsung in smartphone chips but hires the Korean company to make some of them. Samsung hasn't revealed how much of its logic-chip revenue comes from building chips designed by others, known in the trade as foundry work. Analysts believe Samsung has three factories making logic chips designed by other companies and one plant for its own chips. Samsung last month said it reached maximum production at its newest logic-chip factory in Austin in just five months, a rapid ramp-up for a chip plant of any type. Analysts say the factory, which employs about 1,100 people, is producing the A5 chip used in Apple's latest devices. Samsung declines to comment on customers but it has pumped $9 billion into memory and logic production lines in Austin. --- Don Clark in San Francisco contributed to this article.

201201,Real Bonding With Family Around the TV Via Skype,"As you read these words, millions of people are conducting video chats using the popular Skype service, now owned by Microsoft. Most of these calls are low-resolution encounters between two individuals, conducted over personal computers. This week, I tested a new device that aims to transform Skype video chats into room-size experiences, involving whole families or groups of friends on each end -- seeing each other, chatting and sharing photos in high definition using TVs. It's called telyHD, and comes from a small Silicon Valley start-up called Tely Labs. In my tests, it worked well. This TV add-on product is a black, horizontal bar less than a foot long and under 3 inches high with a wide-angle lens and multiple built-in microphones. It installs quickly and easily -- typically on top of the TV -- and is controlled by a remote from across the room that can be used to place and answer calls, and to zoom and pan your image. It can connect to any other Skype-enabled device -- including PCs, Macs, smartphones and tablets -- but some of its advanced features require a telyHD on both sides of the conversation. The $250 telyHD isn't just a different way to use Skype. It's part of the race to reinvent the television -- to make it a smarter, more versatile digital device. So-called smart TVs, Internet-enabled sets that connect to the Web and run apps, are offered by most major manufacturers. The telyHD device brings added functionality and connectivity to existing ""dumb"" HDTVs that lack built-in online features. There is no monthly fee or subscription required by Tely Labs, and video calls between a telyHD and any other Skype device, including another telyHD, are free. You can also make free Skype-to-Skype audio calls, and audio calls to regular phones can be made at Skype's normal rates. I've been testing telyHD in my family room on my aging Pioneer 50-inch plasma HDTV. I made multiple calls to people at the company using other telyHD units. And, with my wife at my side, in our usual seats, we made video calls to each of our out-of-state children, who were using Skype-equipped computers. On our end of the calls, we didn't have to crowd around a laptop webcam, jump up to fiddle with the unit, or do anything different than if we had been watching TV. Our kids reported they could see and hear us both fine, even though we were about 10 feet from the camera. One person I tested with did report some audio feedback on her computer. I can say that telyHD worked as advertised, and provided good, generally smooth experiences on every call, whether I used a wired network connection or Wi-Fi on my end. The calls to other telyHDs appeared in high definition on our screen, though the calls to computers were lower resolution, as with many Skype calls. And, if you're concerned about rogue invasions of privacy, the telyHD has a sliding plastic shield to cover the camera when not in use. You can buy telyHD from the company's site, tely.com, or at Skype.com or Amazon.com. Ironically, it is hitting the market shortly after Cisco stopped selling a somewhat similar home video-calling product. Cisco's product cost much more, wasn't tied into Skype and carried a monthly fee. TelyHD isn't just a webcam. It's a small computing device, powered by Google's Android operating system. It contains software and Internet capabilities most TVs lack, some of which go beyond simple video calls. For instance, when contacting other telyHD units, I was able to send and receive video voice mails. And I was able to plug into the telyHD a flash memory card filled with pictures. I could share the pictures with another telyHD user and vice versa. I could even choose to copy a photo from the other party onto my own memory card. You can do the same thing with a USB drive. (TelyHD isn't the only way to use Skype for a whole-room view from a TV. Some of the new smart TVs, and even some Blu-ray players, come equipped with Skype software. When paired with a webcam, they, too, can conduct Skype video calls via the TV. I didn't test these for this column.) TelyHD can be placed on top of the TV, on a shelf, or on a tripod. It requires a broadband Internet connection, either wired or wireless, and an HDMI port on the TV, which is common on HDTVs. It mounts on top of even thin TVs using a built-in clamp that doesn't require tools. I set up my test unit in about 15 minutes. The system can't be used simultaneously with regular TV-watching. Just as with a DVD player, you must switch to a separate ""input"" on your TV to bring it up. When you do, it signs you into your Skype account and fills the screen with a carousel of big cards representing your Skype contacts. You click on a card with the remote to place or answer a call. There are various screen layouts you can choose, including a small window that shows what you look like to others and windows that show tips on what the remote buttons do. My only serious complaint with telyHD is that the remote control seems cheap, with hard-to-press buttons. But the company says it has designed an improved remote and will offer this new one free to existing owners. Also, as with many TV services, it's a pain to peck out user names, or searches, on an on-screen keyboard. And I found a bug in which the unit didn't recognize certain Wi-Fi network names, but the company fixed it earlier this week. Tely Labs plans more versions of telyHD and more features. A pricier model for small businesses is in the works, which will allow live file sharing, and have a better camera and a keyboard. A second software version also is coming. It will allow the unit to send to the TV screen video from Apple's iPad and will also support photo sharing from online services. The company is working on allowing video calling among up to 10 devices, though that will carry a fee. I can recommend telyHD for people with HDTVs who want to move their Skype video calling to where whole groups can get into the picture. --- Watch a video of Walt Mossberg discussing telyHD at WSJ.com/PersonalTech.

201201,Lumia Highlights Nokia's Old Scars,"It wasn't the bloodbath many had feared. Nokia's €1.1 billion ($1.44 billion) full-year loss and 9% sales slump lifted its shares slightly Thursday. The launch of its new ""Lumia"" Windows Phones is on track. But there are some ugly scars from its old product range. Earnings expectations for Nokia were low. Weak sales forecasts by one of its main chip suppliers, ST Ericsson, caused its shares to fall 5% earlier in the week. Nokia's biggest achievement in the last quarter was the launch—on schedule—of two Windows-based smartphones. It has sold more than a million across 15 markets—no iPhone, but a decent beginning. Nokia hopes these phones will allow it to compete with Apple and Google, and drive a return to 10% operating margins in coming years, from 3% at present. Taking on the behemoths will be tough. Nokia admits it must do a better job accelerating product launches and training retail staff to promote its new phones. Windows Phone 7 had less than a 2% market share in the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K. at year-end, versus an average 80% and rising share for Android and iPhone operating systems together, according to Kantar Worldpanel data. Average selling prices for Nokia's phones continue to fall. This quarter, it believes operating margins could turn negative. Meanwhile, its old ""Symbian"" smartphone range, estimated to make up more than a third of total phone sales, is rapidly losing ground. Its previous expectation of selling 150 million in coming years has been abandoned. Nokia is under pressure from very low-priced devices in markets like China, where its Symbian phones don't run on the CDMA technology that local operators currently prefer. Nokia also has a much higher share of nonsmart-phones than competitors, in a market that is forecast to shrink this year. Nokia booked a €1.1 billion impairment in the fourth quarter, as it revalued its mapping division. Its loss-making joint venture Nokia Siemens Networks is being restructured this year. Trading at 12 times forecast 2013 earnings, Nokia's shares look fully valued, notes Standard & Poor's. Particularly given the battles it faces ahead.

201201,RealNetworks to Sell Patents to Intel,"Intel Corp. agreed to pay $120 million to RealNetworks Inc. for video software and a large number of patents, in a deal that builds the chip maker's portfolio for streaming media on smartphones, laptops and other devices. Intel will receive about 190 patents and 170 patent applications, as well as next-generation software that allows the quick compression or decompression of video for streaming. RealNetworks, meanwhile, will be able to use the patents in current and future products and will be working with Intel on continued development of the software and related products. ""To bring new technology like that [video software] to market requires significant reach into the consumer and business markets,"" RealNetworks Chief Executive Thomas Nielsen said in an interview. ""A partner like Intel has the capacity and size to do that."" The deal—which sent RealNetworks shares soaring 29% to $9.51 in recent trading, though they still are down 38% over the past 12 months—is the latest move by a large technology company to scoop up key patents. Bidding for intellectual property peaked in June, when a coterie of companies paid $4.5 billion to bankrupt telecommunications-equipment maker Nortel Networks Corp. for 6,000 patents. Calling themselves Rockstar Bidco, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and four others blew away Google Inc.'s $900 million bid. Intel's move will let it better address the fast-growing streaming video market. Companies have been building their arsenals to fend off lawsuits as competition becomes more heated in markets such as smartphones and tablets. The company, which dominates the market for PC processors, has been trying to expand into mobile devices, as well as create computers that can better compete with tablets. It announced its first two smartphone partnerships this month, with Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. planning to introduce phones in 2012. Intel also has been building its software business, buying security software provider McAfee Inc. a year ago. RealNetworks' CEO, meanwhile, on Thursday said the patent sale allows the company, perhaps best known for its RealPlayer media player, to generate additional capital for investing in new businesses and markets. The deal is ""about realizing this unused asset we've been sitting on for several years,"" Nielsen said. ""Frankly, we're not in the market of making money off our patents like other companies, so we saw the ability to realize that value without having any material impact on our business."" In addition to the sale agreement, RealNetworks and Intel signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on future support and development of the next-generation video software and related products. S&P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler noted the deal will substantially boost RealNetworks' balance sheet and is a ""constructive way"" for Nielsen to create additional value for the company and shareholders. RealNetworks has been developing the video software over the past four to five years, Nielsen said. It has not yet been deployed to the public but will soon be available for testing and optimization. He estimates it could hit the market in about 12 to 18 months. Nielsen, who joined RealNetworks as CEO in November, said the technology likely will be licensed to companies for use in smartphones, tablets, PCs, Internet-connected smart TVs, set-top boxes and other devices. Nielsen said the deal should close in the next 30 to 45 days, with seven RealNetworks employees joining Intel. He said he doesn't expect any issues receiving regulatory approval. Intel shares, up 23% over the past 12 months, recently were off a fraction to $26.76.

201201,"NEC Forecasts a Loss; Firm to Cut 10,000 Jobs, Sees $1.29 Billion in Red Ink for the Year","TOKYO—NEC Corp. plans to cut 10,000 jobs and warned that a combination of asset write-downs and restructuring costs will result in a net loss of more than $1 billion for this fiscal year. The job cuts at NEC, which provides technology services and makes computers and other electronic devices, come as many of Japan's globally exposed technology companies seek ways to cope with the impact of the strong yen on overseas operations. The currency's strength reduces earnings when overseas sales are repatriated and makes Japan-made goods less competitive in overseas markets. ""We can't expect major growth in Japan and other markets right now, so we need to build a structure that allows us to generate stable profits even in this environment,"" President Nobuhiro Endo said at a news conference Thursday. He said it was unclear how the European debt crisis will affect Japan and its major businesses, many of which are NEC's clients. NEC plans to cut 7,000 jobs at its domestic operations—a relative rarity in Japan—and the rest overseas. About half of the 10,000 are full-time, permanent NEC employees. The company reported about 116,000 employees, including those working at consolidated subsidiaries but excluding temporary and outsourced workers, as of March 2011. NEC's operations have made significant shifts in recent years, such as the decision last year to form a personal-computer joint venture with Lenovo Group Ltd., in which the Chinese company will hold a 51% stake. Mr. Endo said the company now is considering ""fundamental"" restructuring in its unprofitable handset joint venture, such as using outside design houses to reduce product-development costs. He said the company's restructuring drive also will target its technology-platform business, which includes servers, storage and software, and NEC's subsidiary that makes electronic parts. NEC forecast a net loss of ¥100 billion ($1.29 billion) for the fiscal year through March. The company earlier had predicted a ¥15 billion profit. NEC blamed the loss on ¥74 billion in tax-asset write-downs and ¥40 billion in restructuring costs. The company cut its forecast for full-year operating profit to ¥70 billion from ¥90 billion and its revenue forecast to ¥3.1 trillion from ¥3.25 trillion. NEC recorded a net loss of ¥86.53 billion ($1.11 billion) for its fiscal third quarter, compared with a net loss of ¥26.53 billion a year earlier. The company's third-quarter operating loss narrowed to ¥8.21 billion from ¥13.48 billion. Revenue fell to ¥669.01 billion from ¥720.72 billion. The company said the restructuring will create more room for spending in areas where it sees potential for growth. In addition to restructuring struggling operations, the company will concentrate investment in areas such as technology services and network infrastructure for mobile carriers, Mr. Endo said. With the popularity of smartphones forcing mobile carriers to upgrade their networks, NEC said it sees potential growth in offering services to wireless carriers. ""We have to selectively spend on areas where we can differentiate our products,"" Mr. Endo said. NEC reports earnings under Japanese accounting standards.

201201,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Monday: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Tuesday: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Wednesday: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Thursday: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of (EURO)1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a (EURO)1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of (EURO)745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. . Coming up: Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc.

201201,"Motorola Mobility sinks to 4Q loss on flat revenue, posing possible headaches for Google","LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. (AP) - Motorola Mobility sank to a fourth-quarter loss while trying to close its proposed $12.5 billion sale to Google. The setback, announced Thursday, came amid fierce competition in the markets for smartphones and tablet computers. The disappointing results mirrored preliminary numbers that Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. released three weeks ago. At this point, Motorola's performance is probably a bigger concern to Google's shareholders than Motorola's because of the deal the two companies reached last summer. Google has agreed to pay $40 per share for Motorola's vast patent portfolio, as well as its devices. The acquisition still needs regulatory approval in the U.S., Europe, China, Russia and several other countries. Google Inc. is counting on Motorola's more than 17,000 patents to help insulate its Android software for mobile devices against lawsuits alleging that the system stole innovations owned by other companies, including tech heavyweights such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. But Google also plans to keep churning out devices under the Motorola brand, raising potential hardware headaches for a company that has concentrated on Internet search and other online services until now. Some analysts are already worried Motorola Mobility will become a financial millstone that could drag down Google's earnings growth. If that happens, Google's stock price would likely suffer. Motorola Mobility already relies on Google's Android software for a tablet computer and many of its phones. But so do many other phone makers, something that Google says won't change even after it takes control of Motorola. Google CEO Larry Page says the company intends to operate Motorola Mobility as a separate business. Apple's iPhone and iPad appeared to pose bigger challenges to Motorola Mobility in its most recent quarter, when Apple sold 37 million iPhone and shipped 15.4 million iPads, and its earnings soared to $13 billion. Meanwhile, Motorola Mobility sold a total of 10.5 million mobile devices, including 5.3 million smartphones. The company's mobile device division posted an operating loss of $70 million for the fourth quarter, swinging from an operating profit of $72 million in the same period in 2010. The result: Motorola Mobility lost $80 million, or 27 cents per share, during the final three months of last year. That contrasted with earnings of $80 million at the same time in 2010. The company didn't break down its 2010 earnings by share because that period began before Motorola Mobility spun off from Motorola Inc. If not for certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, Motorola Mobility said it would have earned 20 cents per share in its most recent quarter. That's below the average estimate of 26 cents per share among analysts polled by FactSet. Before the company released its preliminary results earlier this month, analysts were expecting 42 cents per share. Revenue totaled $3.4 billion, unchanged from the previous year. Before the company advised investors of the fourth-quarter letdown, analysts projected revenue of $3.9 billion for the period. Google also could use Motorola Mobility's cable TV boxes as vehicles for delivering more of its Internet services and advertising to living rooms across the U.S. Fourth-quarter revenue in Motorola Mobility's home division fell 11 percent from the previous year to $897 million on lower sales set-top boxes. The division's operating profit edged up 6 percent to $57 million. The results didn't sway Motorola Mobility's stock that much because Google's $40-per-share offer is still on the table. Motorola Mobility's shares edged up 7 cents to $38.74 in extended trading, after rising 7 cents during regular trading as well. Google shares added 90 cents to $569 after hours. Motorola Mobility said Thursday that it is hoping to close the Google deal ""as expeditiously as possible,"" but it didn't provide a specific timetable. If the acquisition doesn't go through, Google will have to pay a $2.5 billion breakup fee. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Monday: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Tuesday: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Wednesday: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Thursday: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,"AT&T 4th-quarter results weighed down by charges, record iPhone sales","NEW YORK (AP) - AT&T Inc. is still the home of the iPhone. It activated 7.6 million of them in the latest quarter, accounting for one out of every five iPhones sold globally. And AT&T remains heavily dependent on the iPhone to gain and keep customers, despite a vow by CEO Randall Stephenson a year ago to ""very aggressively"" market competing smartphones in 2011. That vow came in the wake of AT&T's loss of an exclusive right to sell the iPhone in the U.S. The iPhone accounted for about 80 percent of the smartphones AT&T activated in the fourth quarter of 2011, up from 70 percent just before Stephenson made his vow. The figures are somewhat skewed because the fourth quarter of 2011 saw the launch of a new iPhone model, the iPhone 4S, whereas the fourth quarter of 2010 didn't. Looking at annual sales instead, there's a decline in the iPhone's percentage of AT&T smartphones -- to 69 percent last year, from 79 percent in 2010. The Dallas-based company has also retained its position as the premier U.S. iPhone carrier, beating Verizon Wireless' 4.3 million iPhone activations handily. AT&T's iPhone dependency comes at a heavy cost. The phone is more expensive than many other smartphones, and AT&T needs to subsidize each iPhone with hundreds of dollars to put it in customers' hands for as little as $1. That, together with massive charges for adjustments in the value of the company's pension plans, the breakup of a deal to buy T-Mobile USA and a writedown of the value of its phone-directory business, forced AT&T to report a massive loss on Thursday of $6.68 billion, or $1.12 per share, for the fourth quarter. It was the first quarterly loss for AT&T in three years. An adjustment of pension-plan obligations was also the main culprit behind the previous loss, in the fourth quarter of 2008. AT&T took a charge of $4.2 billion for the compensation it's paying T-Mobile USA. When AT&T made the $39 billion bid in March, it promised T-Mobile cash and wireless licenses if the deal fell through. The deal was squelched by federal regulators, who saw reason to believe that the No. 2 wireless carrier buying No. 4 would reduce competition. On Thursday, Stephenson said the company's Plan B consists of trying to buy more wireless spectrum in smaller deals, selling low-performing units and instituting a share-buyback program. AT&T said it has board authorization to buy back 300 million shares, worth about $9 billion, and will start doing so immediately. Excluding charges, net income was 42 cents per share in the latest quarter, a penny shy of Wall Street expectations, according to a survey by FactSet. The loss compares with net income of $1.09 billion, or 18 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $32.5 billion, helped by the smartphone sales. Analysts were expecting revenue of $31.99 billion, on average. After stripping out the jump in smartphone sales, which constitute an immediate loss for the company, revenue grew 0.6 percent from last year. Wireless service fees are growing slower than before, barely making up for the decline of AT&T's traditional-phone business. AT&T said it expects earnings per share to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2012, a bit lower than analysts had expected. In afternoon trading Thursday, shares of AT&T Inc. fell 68 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $29.53. Most of the iPhone activations were upgrades for people who were already AT&T subscribers. The carrier gained a net 717,000 subscribers on contract plans in the quarter. That was the best result all year, but didn't match Verizon's 1.2 million. AT&T has been lagging Verizon in this important measure for more than a year. For all of 2011, AT&T earned $3.9 billion, or 66 cents per share, on $126.7 billion in revenue. That compares with $19.9 billion, or $3.35 per share, on $124.3 billion in revenue in 2010. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,Nokia posts Q4 loss of $1.38 billion as sales slump 21 pct despite Windows phone launch,"HELSINKI (AP) - Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. on Thursday posted a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million in the same period a year earlier. Nokia said net revenue -- including both its mobile phones and its network divisions -- fell from euro12.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to euro10 billion, with smartphone sales plunging 23 percent. Nokia has lost its once-dominant position in the global cell phone market, with Android phones and iPhones overtaking it in the growing smartphone segment. The Finnish company is attempting a comeback with smartphones using Microsoft's Windows software, a struggle that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop characterized as a ""war of ecosystems."" He said Nokia has sold ""well over"" 1 million such devices since the launch of the Lumia line in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. Including other models, Nokia sold 19.6 million smartphones in the quarter, down from 28 million a year earlier. By comparison, Apple sold 37 million iPhones. The Lumia 800 and Lumia 710 hit stores in Europe and Asia in November, while T-Mobile started offering the 710 in the U.S. in January. Nokia hopes to boost its poor presence in the U.S. with the higher-end Lumia 900, which AT&T will offer later this year. Elop said Nokia would be shipping Lumia phones to Canada next month and China and South America during the first half of this year. ""With Lumia, our specific intent has been to establish a beachhead in this war of ecosystems, and country by country that is what we are now accomplishing,"" Elop said in a conference call. Nokia shares closed up 2.7 percent at euro4.16 ($5.38) on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Michael Schroeder, analyst at FIM bank in Helsinki, said markets had welcomed Elop's comments on Lumia sales. ""It definitely alleviated concerns about a horror scenario, expected by some. Although a million is not a lot in the market, it was better than expected,"" Schroeder said. The company said it would not provide annual targets for 2012 since it was in a ""year of transition"" but added that it expects operating margins in the first quarter of this year to be ""about break-even, ranging either above or below by approximately 2 percentage points."" It repeated the target of cutting costs by more than euro1 billion by 2013. Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics in London said Nokia ""was not out of the woods yet,"" but its quarterly result was in line with expectations. ""Nokia is not necessarily dead in the water. Profit margins were a bit higher than expected and Nokia has not lost its third position in smartphones, although it is suffering in North America and western Europe,"" Mawston said. Nokia proposed a dividend of euro0.20 per share for 2011 and said that chairman and former CEO Jorma Ollila will step down at the annual meeting in May. A nomination committee proposed board member Risto Siilasmaa as the new chairman. The average selling price of a Nokia handset rose by euro2 from the previous quarter to euro53 but was down from euro69 a year earlier, reflecting a higher proportion of cheaper mobile phones in Nokia's product mix. The company also reported a 4 percent drop in sales for Nokia Siemens Networks, its joint network equipment unit with Siemens AG of Germany. After selling four in 10 smartphones worldwide in 2010, Nokia has steadily lost market share to competitors, including Apple and Samsung. It didn't give any market share estimates in the report Thursday, but said its net revenue fell 9 percent to euro38.6 billion in the full year 2011, with smartphone sales plunging 27 percent and total mobile phone sales down 18 percent. Nokia, based in Espoo near the Finnish capital, employs 130,000 people -- down from more than 132,000 a year earlier. ------ Karl Ritter reported from Stockholm. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,HOW TO PLAY IT: The anti-contrarian on Apple's high,"NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Apple's first quarter in the post-Steve Jobs era was a success. Apple reported that it sold more than 37 million iPhones and some 15.5 million iPads during its last quarter after the market closed Tuesday. Its shares jumped more than 6 percent and hit an all-time high Wednesday, leapfrogging Apple past Exxon Mobil to once again become the most valuable company in the world. In what seems to be a quarterly routine, analysts scrambled to raise their target prices for the company following its earnings announcement. Among the highest target: $670, 50 percent above its Tuesday close. A stock as popular with investors as Apple typically has contrarians pointing to signs of trouble. But there are several reasons why simple contrarianism might not pan out this time. GO TO THE SOURCE The best way to play Apple's earnings? Buy Apple. Despite gaining more than 25 percent over the last year, Apple still looks like a value stock to many investors. ""The stock is cheaper now than the day I bought it,"" said Stephen Coleman, head of St. Louis-based Daedalus Capital. Coleman began buying Apple at $11.20 in February 2004, he said. Since then, he's notched a 3,888 percent gain. Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 12. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 index, meanwhile, trades a P/E multiple of about 13. By comparison, Amazon.com, Apple's most direct competitor in the tablet market, trades at a P/E of 98. The company is trading at a discount according to other metrics as well. Based on its growth rate, the company's intrinsic value is $533.40 per share, a nearly 20 percent jump from its current share price of $446.66, according to Starmine. Its gross margins increased 4.4 percent from the prior quarter, according to Michael Holt, an analyst at Morningstar. Why aren't Apple shares trading higher? The market appears to be discounting Apple's ability to maintain its earnings growth now that it has a dominant position in the smartphone and tablet markets, analysts said. The company's forward price to earnings ratio is now just 11.1 times future earnings, according to Starmine. High forward P/Es typically imply that investors expect earnings growth to accelerate. In 2003, for instance, the company traded at a forward P/E ratio of 80 after introducing the iPod some two years earlier, according to Starmine. Apple also has nearly $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Possible options for that staggering sum is something that the company is ""actively discussing,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO, on its earnings call. The company's cash pile equates to $103 per share, noted T. Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. ""With Apple expected to cross $100 billion in cash during the March quarter, we believe this milestone might push Apple to announce a dividend,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Investors may be reluctant to buy any stock hitting an all-time high. ""The $430 region was formerly resistance on Apple, but with the huge gap up after earnings on Wednesday, that level now becomes very strong support,"" said Gareth Feighery, a founder of options education firm MarketTamer.com in Philadelphia. Feighery suggests a strategy that sees limited downside and risk for Apple shares with a so-called February $430-$420 bull put spread - buying the lower strike put and selling the higher strike put. This trade essentially allows an investor to profit from the spread as long as shares don't fall below $430. The spread involves the sale of the $430 strike put to finance the purchase of the $420 strike put to collect a premium of $1.39. The strategy offers a risk return of 16.1 percent based on the shares trading at $448. The danger is if shares fall below $430, and if assigned, the investor would be obligated to buy the stock at $430. The purpose of the $420 put purchase is to limit risk if the shares were to drop precipitously and offers protection, Feighery said. Equity put options convey the right to sell shares at a preset price any time up until expiration and are often used by investors to insure their long stock positions against a potential decline in shares. LOOK OVERSEAS With its roles as both manufacturer and, increasingly, consumer of iPhones, China is a key part of Apple's strategy. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, told analysts that China ""is an extremely important market for us and we continue to look at how to grow it further."" Investors can benefit from Apple's growth in China. China Unicom is currently the only one of China's three mobile service companies to offer an iPhone with a service contract. China Unicom will likely continue to grow earnings as the country's consumers upgrade their services. ""We believe China Unicom should benefit the most from the 3G migration in China,"" Edward Fung, head of research at Kim Eng, wrote in a Jan. 20 note to clients. Tsz Wang, an analyst at DBS Group Research, rates the company a buy because of its strength in the broad smartphone market. ""We stress that entry-level smartphones is the key growth driver as it makes smart devices affordable to lower-spending users,"" Wang wrote in a Jan. 20 note to clients. U.S. investors may want to look at funds with relatively large positions in China Unicom, rather than attempt to buy shares directly. The Prudential Financial Great China fund, for instance, invests 5.6 percent of its assets in China Unicom, according to Thomson Reuters data. The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index (VWO) also have large positions in the company. Investors should be cautious before buying companies like Nokia and Samsung that currently have a larger share of China's mobile market than Apple, said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analysts. ""Nokia without question should be worried,"" he said. ""Apple has crushed many players in this market and they are now attacking Nokia in the developing region."" Investors may instead want to buy low-priced companies that manufacture components that go into Apple's products, Mawston said. Intel, for instance, trades at a P/E of 11 and offers a dividend of 3.1 percent.

201201,Nokia seen struggling in early days for Windows Phone,"* Q4 report due around 1100 GMT * Underlying profits seen diving * Windows Phone takeup eyed * Siilasmaa seen taking over as chairman By Tarmo Virki HELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker by volume, is expected to remain barely in the black in the fourth quarter, with its new Windows Phone models yet to compensate for diving sales of its legacy smartphones. Nokia is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings per share falling 82 percent from a year ago to 0.04 euros and to forecast a weak start to 2012, when it releases results at around 1100 GMT. Nokia unveiled a high-profile strategy shift to Microsoft software on its smartphones last February in a bid to rival to Apple and Google's Android. Nokia's fourth-quarter smartphone sales are seen down 33 percent from a year ago to 18.7 million handsets, according to a Reuters poll. Analysts said Nokia was expected to sell only 1-2 million of of the two Windows Phone models in the quarter, with exact numbers giving little indication on whether Microsoft software could battle against Apple and Google. NEW CHAIRMAN Research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said on Wednesday the Windows Phone share in all of the nine key markets it measures remained at less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter, despite the high-profile launch from Nokia. In addition to the quarterly numbers Nokia's board is expected to propose a cut in the dividend and to name Risto Siilasmaa as its next chairman to replace long-time leader, Jorma Ollila, who is due to step down in May. Siilasmaa, a 45-year old enterpreneur, has been a Nokia board member since 2008 and is known in Finland as the founder of software security company F-Secure, but has a lower profile outside the country. Most phone makers that have reported so far have disappointed the market, losing market share to Apple, whose sales of 37 million iPhones beat expectations. ""The record quarter from Apple suggests Nokia's ... results may have limited room for upside,"" said analyst Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics. Nokia's network equipment arm could also disappoint after bigger rival Ericsson stunned the market with a 50 percent fall in its core profits and warned telecoms operators were likely to remain cautious on spending in the months ahead.

201201,"UPDATE 2-LG Display Q4 loss narrows, expects stable panel prices","* Q4 op loss 144.8 bln won vs 117 bln loss estimated * Q4 sales 6.6 trln won vs 6.5 trln won fcast * Sees panel prices stabilizing, early turnaround * Shares up as much as 3.2 pct (Adds share price, outlook, analyst comments) By Miyoung Kim SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Flat-screen maker LG Display posted a sharply narrowed quarterly loss on Friday, helped by solid demand from smartphones and tablet makers such as Apple Inc and as falling TV panel prices stabilised. Its shares gained as much as 3.2 percent after the South Korean company expected an ""early turnaround"" and panel prices to stabilise further. ""LG Display is expected to further narrow its loss in the current quarter and turn around in the second quarter, helped by sales of its higher-margin products such as 3D TV panels and panels used in Apple's iPhone and iPad,"" said SR Kwon, an analyst at Dongbu Securities. LG Display is a key panel supplier for Apple's popular iPad and iPhone. Apple on Tuesday reported quarterly results that blew past market expectations on record sales of iPhones and iPads. The Korean company, which vies with home rival Samsung Electronics Co for the top position in LCD flat screens globally, is also a key panel supplier for Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Fire tablet, which showed strong sales during the year-end holiday season. LG Display's October-December operating loss was 144.8 billion won ($129.3 million), slightly worse than a 117 billion won loss forecast in a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That marked its fifth consecutive quarterly loss, but was a big improvement from a 492 billion won loss in the previous quarter and a 387 billion won loss a year ago. Samsung Electronics on Friday posted a record $4.7 billion quarterly operating profit, driven by booming smartphone sales, and will spend $22 billion this year to boost production of chips and flat screens to pull further ahead of smaller rivals. It also warned that LCD demand will remain subdued in the first quarter at least until March due to a weak global economy and low seasonal demand. STABLE PRICES SEEN ""The total shipments of LG Display for the first quarter of 2012 will be similar to the fourth quarter of 2011 and prices are expected to remain stable,"" James Jeong, Chief Financial Officer of LG Display, said in a statement. ""Going forward, LG Display is confident about its ability to maintain its leadership with a host of differentiated products in the global display sector even in a rapidly changing market and well positioned to achieve an early turnaround."" But slack sales of TVs and computers in mature markets are set to keep an earnings recovery slow amid growing financial pressure to raise investment as LG Display prepares to mass-produce OLED (organic light-emitting diodes) displays, which are set to replace LCDs as the main panels for TVs in coming years. Consumers in mature markets have been delaying TV purchases until the economy improves, while PC sales growth remain slack as customers are ditching PCs in favour of tablets. Global TV shipments are forecast to grow 2 percent this year after no growth in 2011 due to soft consumer demand, according to research firm DisplaySearch. Panels for TVs, computer monitors and laptops account for 80 percent of LG Display's revenues and the rest comes from mobile phones and tablets. Shares in the panel maker, which also competes with AU Optronics and Chimei Innolux Corp, were trading up 1.1 percent in a wider market that was up 0.09 percent as of 0350 GMT. LG Display shares rose 16 percent over the past three months, outperforming a 3 percent gain in the broader market.

201201,"Samsung to report Q4; eyes on smartphone sales, spending plans","* Q4 operating profit seen up 73 pct to record 5.2 trln won * Eyes on Q4 handset sales data, 2012 investment plans * Shares up 18 pct in 3 months vs 3 pct gain in KOSPI By Miyoung Kim SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top technology firm by revenue, will report record quarterly profit on Friday, powered by strong sales of its smartphones, but most interest will be in its 2012 spending plans and mobile sales numbers as it vies with Apple Inc for smartphone supremacy. Samsung overtook Apple as the biggest smartphone maker in the third quarter, but is likely to have slipped back into second place in October-December as Apple sold a record 37.04 million iPhones. Samsung does not provide its own sales volume data and is likely only to give a growth rate from its third-quarter sales of 27.8 million smartphones. Analysts predict fourth-quarter shipments of 35-37 million. The South Korean firm said earlier this month its October-December operating profit was likely to be a record 5.2 trillion won ($4.6 billion), up 73 percent from a year ago and up 22 percent from the previous quarter. Investors will be looking for more detail on Samsung's investment plans for this year after parent Samsung Group announced a record $41.4 billion spending for 2012, with no detailed breakdown. Spending will be on everything from building factories to research and development activities to M&A and hiring. Best known for making massive investments in new technologies ahead of rivals, Samsung is now banking on logic chips and OLED displays to repeat its roaring success in flash chips, computer memory chips and LCD flat-screens, even as a gloomy global economic and IT spending outlook forces peers to be conservative in spending. ""What's important is the 2012 capex budget, as the headline sales and operating profit ... were already announced,"" Macquarie analyst Daniel Kim said. The brokerage estimates Samsung Electronics will announce record investment of 29 trillion won ($25.76 billion), up by almost a third 32 percent from 2011. Investment in system chips such as mobile processors and sensors used in smartphones, tablets and cameras is likely to exceed spending on its bread-and-butter memory chips for the first time, reaching 7.5 trillion won, or some 1 trillion won more than investment in memory chips, according to analysts. Samsung trails Nokia in mobile phones, competes with Sony Corp and LG Electronics Inc in televisions, Toshiba and Hynix in chips and LG Display in displays. RIVALRY WITH APPLE Samsung only entered the smartphone market in earnest in 2010, some three years after Apple first introduced the iPhone with the touchscreen template. Samsung may not have come up with the concept, but it has adopted Apple's breakthrough idea perhaps better than any other handset maker - and now seeks to offer the Apple experience at a better price, with better functionality. Apple is Samsung's biggest client, buying mainly chips and displays, and the two firms are locked in a bruising patent battle in some 10 countries from the United States to Europe, Japan and Australia as they jostle for top spot in the booming smartphone and tablet market. Apple, though, is streets ahead in profitability. Apple, which generates half its revenue from the iPhone, boasts a 37.4 percent operating margin versus Samsung's 11 percent, and its $17.3 billion operating profit is almost four times what Samsung earned from selling phones, chips, flat screens, TVs and fridges combined. Shares in Samsung, also the world's top maker of memory chips and TVs, have climbed 20 percent in the past three months - and hit a life high of 1,113,000 won this week - outperforming a 3 percent gain in the KOSPI over the same period. On Nasdaq, Apple shares have risen 23 percent in that time, hitting a life high of more than $454 on Wednesday.

201201,RPT-HOW TO PLAY IT: The anti-contrarian on Apple's high,"(Repeats to add subscribers) NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Apple's first quarter in the post-Steve Jobs era was a success. Apple reported that it sold more than 37 million iPhones and some 15.5 million iPads during its last quarter after the market closed Tuesday. Its shares jumped more than 6 percent and hit an all-time high Wednesday, leapfrogging Apple past Exxon Mobil to once again become the most valuable company in the world. In what seems to be a quarterly routine, analysts scrambled to raise their target prices for the company following its earnings announcement. Among the highest target: $670, 50 percent above its Tuesday close. A stock as popular with investors as Apple typically has contrarians pointing to signs of trouble. But there are several reasons why simple contrarianism might not pan out this time. GO TO THE SOURCE The best way to play Apple's earnings? Buy Apple. Despite gaining more than 25 percent over the last year, Apple still looks like a value stock to many investors. ""The stock is cheaper now than the day I bought it,"" said Stephen Coleman, head of St. Louis-based Daedalus Capital. Coleman began buying Apple at $11.20 in February 2004, he said. Since then, he's notched a 3,888 percent gain. Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 12. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 index, meanwhile, trades a P/E multiple of about 13. By comparison, Amazon.com, Apple's most direct competitor in the tablet market, trades at a P/E of 98. The company is trading at a discount according to other metrics as well. Based on its growth rate, the company's intrinsic value is $533.40 per share, a nearly 20 percent jump from its current share price of $446.66, according to Starmine. Its gross margins increased 4.4 percent from the prior quarter, according to Michael Holt, an analyst at Morningstar. Why aren't Apple shares trading higher? The market appears to be discounting Apple's ability to maintain its earnings growth now that it has a dominant position in the smartphone and tablet markets, analysts said. The company's forward price to earnings ratio is now just 11.1 times future earnings, according to Starmine. High forward P/Es typically imply that investors expect earnings growth to accelerate. In 2003, for instance, the company traded at a forward P/E ratio of 80 after introducing the iPod some two years earlier, according to Starmine. Apple also has nearly $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Possible options for that staggering sum is something that the company is ""actively discussing,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO, on its earnings call. The company's cash pile equates to $103 per share, noted T. Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. ""With Apple expected to cross $100 billion in cash during the March quarter, we believe this milestone might push Apple to announce a dividend,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Investors may be reluctant to buy any stock hitting an all-time high. ""The $430 region was formerly resistance on Apple, but with the huge gap up after earnings on Wednesday, that level now becomes very strong support,"" said Gareth Feighery, a founder of options education firm MarketTamer.com in Philadelphia. Feighery suggests a strategy that sees limited downside and risk for Apple shares with a so-called February $430-$420 bull put spread - buying the lower strike put and selling the higher strike put. This trade essentially allows an investor to profit from the spread as long as shares don't fall below $430. The spread involves the sale of the $430 strike put to finance the purchase of the $420 strike put to collect a premium of $1.39. The strategy offers a risk return of 16.1 percent based on the shares trading at $448. The danger is if shares fall below $430, and if assigned, the investor would be obligated to buy the stock at $430. The purpose of the $420 put purchase is to limit risk if the shares were to drop precipitously and offers protection, Feighery said. Equity put options convey the right to sell shares at a preset price any time up until expiration and are often used by investors to insure their long stock positions against a potential decline in shares. LOOK OVERSEAS With its roles as both manufacturer and, increasingly, consumer of iPhones, China is a key part of Apple's strategy. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, told analysts that China ""is an extremely important market for us and we continue to look at how to grow it further."" Investors can benefit from Apple's growth in China. China Unicom is currently the only one of China's three mobile service companies to offer an iPhone with a service contract. China Unicom will likely continue to grow earnings as the country's consumers upgrade their services. ""We believe China Unicom should benefit the most from the 3G migration in China,"" Edward Fung, head of research at Kim Eng, wrote in a Jan. 20 note to clients. Tsz Wang, an analyst at DBS Group Research, rates the company a buy because of its strength in the broad smartphone market. ""We stress that entry-level smartphones is the key growth driver as it makes smart devices affordable to lower-spending users,"" Wang wrote in a Jan. 20 note to clients. U.S. investors may want to look at funds with relatively large positions in China Unicom, rather than attempt to buy shares directly. The Prudential Financial Great China fund, for instance, invests 5.6 percent of its assets in China Unicom, according to Thomson Reuters data. The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index (VWO) also have large positions in the company. Investors should be cautious before buying companies like Nokia and Samsung that currently have a larger share of China's mobile market than Apple, said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analysts. ""Nokia without question should be worried,"" he said. ""Apple has crushed many players in this market and they are now attacking Nokia in the developing region."" Investors may instead want to buy low-priced companies that manufacture components that go into Apple's products, Mawston said. Intel, for instance, trades at a P/E of 11 and offers a dividend of 3.1 percent.

201201,"UPDATE 5-AT&T reports $6.7 bln loss on hefty charges, iPhone costs","* Q4 adjusted shr $0.42 vs Wall Street view $0.43 * Adds 717,000 subscribers vs analysts' view for 570,000 * Wireless EBITDA margins fall to 28.7 pct * Sees margins improving, may sell directory business * Shares down about 2 percent (Adds comments from conference call, updates share price) By Sinead Carew Jan 26 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc posted a $6.7 billion quarterly loss as it was weighed down by a hefty break-up fee for its failed T-Mobile USA merger and other big charges on top of costly subsidies for smartphones such as Apple Inc's popular iPhone. While the No. 2 U.S. wireless provider beat analysts' expectations for subscriber additions, the growth came at a massive cost as its wireless service margins plummeted. On top of the $4 billion break-up package charge, AT&T also took a big impairment charge for its telephone directory business, which it said it was considering selling. While advanced devices like iPhones can help subscriber numbers and revenue, they also shrink earnings as operators like AT&T and its bigger rival Verizon Wireless heavily subsidize the devices to attract customers to two-year contracts. AT&T's wireless service margin fell to 28.7 percent, based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, from 43.7 percent in the third quarter and 37.6 percent a year earlier, missing already low analysts' expectations. ""If there's any reason to be upset, it certainly is the margins,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King, who had expected a margin of 32 percent. However, he noted that strong smartphone sales should help AT&T in the long run. Its shares were off 2 percent after the news. In a bid to help stem the decline, AT&T said it would begin to aggressively buy back shares under its 300 million share buyback plan. In his first presentation to investors since the December collapse of his $39 billion bid to buy Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile USA , Chief Executive Randall Stephenson spent much of the earnings call criticizing the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for opposing the deal. Stephenson, who had argued that AT&T needed the deal to get more wireless spectrum to support increasing demand for wireless data, said he would buy more spectrum once he is clear on the FCC's spectrum rules. ""My interpretation is these rules are so fluid you could drink out of them with a straw right now,"" he told analysts. EYES MARGIN IMPROVEMENT AT&T, which would have vaulted to first place in the U.S. mobile market if it had purchased No. 4 ranked T-Mobile USA, added 717,000 subscribers in the quarter, beating the average expectation for 570,000 from seven analysts. But its subscriber growth still lagged well behind Verizon Wireless, whose parent Verizon Communications reported 1.2 million subscribers in the quarter on Tuesday at its wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc. Verizon Wireless margins were also hurt by smartphone sales, but not as much as AT&T. Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe said that only time will tell if the race to sign on smartphone customers will be worth the massive drag on margins. ""Its not getting easier. It will be tougher in 2012,"" he said. ""The cost to capture and retain customers will increase as competition increases."" AT&T said it expects to increase wireless margins to around 40 percent this year from 38.1 percent in 2011. The target assumes that 2012 smartphone sales will be similar to 2011, when the company sold 25 million smartphones. AT&T forecast earnings growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range or better for 2012 and said it may be able to accelerate its earnings growth rate after 2012. It forecast growth of about 2 percent for wireless average monthly revenue per user in 2012 and promised overall revenue growth without giving a specific target. ""They should at least do that. Hopefully they do better than 2 percent,"" said Roe. Along with pushing advanced phones, operators are spending billions of dollars on upgrading their networks. Like AT&T and Verizon Wireless, smaller rival Sprint Nextel is also upgrading its network for advanced services this year. On top of this, analysts see T-Mobile USA as a big competitive threat as it will be desperate to attract new subscribers growth since its AT&T deal failed. AT&T posted a fourth-quarter loss of $6.68 billion, or $1.12 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.09 billion, or 18 cents per share. Excluding the special charges, AT&T earned 42 cents per share, a penny below Wall Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $32.5 billion from $31.36 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations for $31.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it has set aside a budget of $20 billion for 2012 capital spending, similar to 2011 levels. Shares of AT&T were down 2.21 percent at $29.54 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

201201,REFILE-INSTANT VIEW 3-Nokia Q4 core profit beats market expectations,"(Corrects spelling of first analyst's name To Michael, not Mikael) HELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nokia reported better-than-expected core earnings for the fourth quarter, although its new Windows Phones still failed to compensate for dividing sales of legacy smartphones. The following are analysts' reactions to the news. MICHAEL SCHRODER, ANALYST, FIM ""The report highlights that the start of the Windows strategy is slow, and we have very little concrete data to predict its success at this point. Uncertainty is still great. ""These are critical times for the future of the whole company. The next months will be extremely important. ""Net cash was a slight surprise, and Lumia numbers as well as dividend were roughly in line with expectations. Overall, it is a positive report."" ""I think the dividend reflects the uncertainty of their outlook. It was a good level, but quite cautious when we note that their cash was boosted by a half billion euros."" ""Basic phones were below expectations. The explanation seems to be in inventories which were filled in Q3."" LARS SODERFJELL, ANALYST, ALANDSBANKEN ""The quarter was pretty good, obviously above expectations, the sales were not as bad as some people feared. ON SHARES: ""But I am a bit surprised that the market has picked up. Although I think a lot of fear was reflected in the price before the result. ""The outlook was not as bad as feared, but still weak and I see that it is up now, so I think it might stay up, but not significantly."" MIKAEL RAUTANEN, ANALYST, INDERES EQUITY RESEARCH ""The results were slightly better than expected. It seems dual SIM phones and basic phones sales, which picked up last summer, has continued briskly and it clearly supported the results. ""Symbian's downward spiral managed to halt by the end of the year and smartphone deliveries were better than expected. ""It was disappointing that in the guidance, the mobile phone unit was forecast to be close to zero or in loss in the first quarter. ""It could calm markets a bit that Elop said Lumia phones have been sold well over a million. ""Nokia Siemens Networks results and guidance were clearly disappointing, but it should not have been a huge surprise for the markets after Ericsson's results."" FRANCISCO JERONIMO, ANALYST, IDC ""As expected the transition from Symbian to Windows Phones still is painful for Nokia. Nokia outlook for the upcoming two quarters is still gloomy. The Windows Phones volumes will not be enough to offset the decline of Symbian and the company will need to improve the internal structure by cutting costs to remain profitable."" HANNU RAUHALA, ANALYST, POHJOLA ""The results were quite neutral, there was nothing dramatic. ""Sales volumes were alright, smartphone sales were a bit better than expected, but cheap phones sales slightly missed expectations. Profitablity was better. ""Guidance was a bit soft, but it seemed markets had expected worse."" GEOFF BLABER, ANALYST, CCS INSIGHT ""Nokia is carefully managing an exceptionally difficult transition and did well to maintain ASP and margin, but it's clear that pressure is growing on Windows Phone to accommodate Symbian's weakness.

201201,UPDATE 5-Nokia profits dive as new phones slow to take off,"* Q4 core eps 0.06 euro vs 0.04 euro forecast * Windows Phones no threat yet to Apple, Google * Proposes Siilasmaa as new chairman * Shares up 1.6 pct after recent weakness (Adds potential strategies to grow Windows Phone sales) By Tarmo Virki HELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj reported a 73 percent fall in fourth-quarter earnings as sales of its new Windows Phones failed to dent the dominance of Apple Inc's iPhone or compensate for diving sales of its own old smartphones. The world's largest cellphone maker by volume unveiled a year ago a major strategy shift to Microsoft Corp software for its smartphones in an attempt to challenge Apple and Google Inc's Android. But Apple's phones in particular have proved far more popular. Apple reported earlier this week sales of 37 million iPhones for the December quarter. Nokia has sold over 1 million Windows 'Lumia' Phones, since its launch in mid-November. ""It is more than some were expecting, but it's not going to worry Apple or Google,"" said analyst Nick Dillon from research firm Ovum. Nokia said it expected its phone business' underlying earnings to be around breakeven in the first quarter, well below analysts forecasts, with sales falling more than usual in the seasonally weaker quarter. ""The report highlights that the start of the Windows strategy is slow, and we have very little concrete data to predict its success at this point,"" said analyst Michael Schroder from FIM Securities. ""There are a lot of uncertainties. These are critical times for the future of the whole company. The next months will be extremely important"". SCALING UP Ben Wood, head of research at mobile consultancy CCS Insight, compared Nokia to a late starter in a marathon, saying it needed to move fast: ""The reality is that it's going to have to be an exceptionally fast marathon if it wants narrow the gap with its rivals"". To close the gap, Nokia will need to move quickly to push out the phone into more markets and with secure more partners. Windows Phones have only been released in 15 markets so far, meaning Nokia has yet to take full advantage of its worldwide sales force -- a presence that could help boost sales fast. In the United States, it has partnered with No. 4 U.S. carrier T-Mobile to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and has yet to break into two of the other largest smartphone markets in the world -- China and Japan. A ramp up in those countries could help Nokia close the gap with rivals. Analysts said Nokia also needed to focus on marketing and sales channel to drive Lumia sales volumes. ""They need to market the hell out of it,"" said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. ""Android is still an easy sale. Nokia needs to convince the sales people in stores to sell Nokia."" BETTER THAN FEARED Nokia's fourth-quarter core earnings per share of 0.06 euro were better than the market's expectation for 0.04 euro. The results were boosted by a $250 million payment from Microsoft as part of the Windows Phone sales deal. Shares in the Nokia were up 1 percent to 4.10 euros at 1526 GMT, regaining some ground lost over the past week following poor results from its suppliers. Nokia proposed a 0.20 euro-per-share dividend for 2011, slightly more than expected. The board put forward Risto Siilasmaa as its next chairman replacing long-time leader, Jorma Ollila, who steps down in May. Nokia's quarterly net loss totalled 1.1 billion euros ($1.43 bln), or 0.29 euros per share, due to a 1.1 billion writedown for its digital mapping assets. Microsoft has tried to enter the mobile industry for more than ten years, but with little success. Its market share is 1-2 percent. Canalys analyst Pete Cunningham said Microsoft's deal with Nokia was make or break for its ambitions in this sector. ""Nokia gives Microsoft a chance to enter the big stage. If they cannot make it work, arguably this is the end of the road,"" he said.

201201,Nokia Q4 core profit beats consensus,"(.) HELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker by volume, reported better-than-expected quarterly core earnings, although they fell 73 percent as its new Windows Phones failed to compensate for diving sales of its legacy smartphones. Nokia's fourth-quarter core earnings per share of 0.06 euros compared to market expectation for 0.04 euros, it said on Thursday.

201201,"UPDATE 2-Japan's NEC to slash 10,000 jobs, sees huge net loss","* To cut 10,000 jobs by Sept * Job losses concentrated in Japan mobile phone unit * Sees annual net loss of 100 bln yen * Smartphone sales hurt by iPhone competition * Foreign rivals squeezing IT business in Japan (Recasts and adds warning of huge loss) By Tim Kelly and Reiji Murai TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - NEC Corp said Thursday it will slash 10,000 jobs, almost one in 10 of its workers, in a bid to cut costs as competition from foreign rivals including Apple Inc pushes it deep into the red. NEC blamed its poor performance on weak demand for its smartphones amid the popularity of Apple's iPhone in Japan, as well as on inroads by foreign rivals into the domestic IT infrastructure business and difficulty in expanding overseas. It warned it would post a net loss of 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) for the year to March 31, much bigger than its previous forecast of a 15 billion yen profit and a similar average estimate from eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the three months ended Dec. 31 it booked a net loss of 87 billion yen. It also slashed its projection for annual mobile phone sales by nearly a quarter to 5 million phones and most of the job cuts will be in its mobile phone business. Headcount will be reduced by the end of September and around 7,000 layoffs will be in Japan, Nobuhiro Endo said at a news conference in Tokyo. Endo said NEC will miss a target to raise overall sales to 4 trillion yen next business year but would still try to reach a goal of boosting its operating profit margin to 5 percent. The restructuring would result in a charge of 40 billion yen this financial year but would add 40 billion yen to income in the next financial year, Endo added. Shares of NEC finished unchanged from Wednesday's close at 168 yen. In the past 52 weeks, its shares have plummeted 32 percent. The company announced its results and restructuring plan after the market closed.

201201,UPDATE 2-Logitech warns again as weak market and euro hit Q3,"* Full-year profit and sales forecast cut again * Q3 sales fall 5 pct to $715 mln * Net profit drops 15 pct to $55 mln * Shares fall 13.5 pct in flat Swiss market (Adds shares, analyst comments) ZURICH, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Logitech, the world's largest computer mouse maker, cut its full-year outlook for the third time after third quarter sales and profit were hit by euro weakness and as computer systems require become less dependent on peripheral components. It was the latest in a string of profit warnings for the maker of webcams, speakers and keyboards, over the last year as the company struggles with a weak economic environment. Logitech now expects to achieve full-year sales of some $2.3 billion, down from $2.4 billion and operating income of around $60 million, compared to its previous forecast of $90 billion. ""Since we last provided our outlook for fiscal year 2012 at the end of October, several factors have changed,"" said Logitech chairman and acting chief executive Guerrino De Luca in a statement on Thursday. ""Most significantly, the euro has weakened considerably during the last three months. In addition, webcams and remotes continue to be impacted more than expected by product portfolio and market weakness."" By 0902 GMT shares in Logitech were down 13.56 percent, underperforming a flat Swiss market. ""The biggest disappointment is the guidance revision for full-year 2012 ... With that we fear confidence in management is eroding further,"" Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth said in a note. In October, De Luca promised no more bad news and the company appeared to have weathered the worst, bouncing back into the black in the second quarter after issuing two profit warnings. As well as euro weakness, Logitech is grappling with a shift towards stand-alone mobile computing systems that do not require peripheral interfaces. ""The fact that new devices like tablet PCs or smartphones function like a camera or already have keyboards integrated, is likely to raise questions about the future course of growth,"" Wegelin analysts said. Logitech's third-quarter sales fell 5 percent to $715 million, while net income dropped 15 percent to $55 million. Its results contrast with stellar earnings for Apple Inc on Tuesday after sales of its iPhone and iPads skyrocketed in the quarter, smashing Wall Street expectations.

201201,"UPDATE 2-Nintendo sees first annual loss, cuts 3DS fcast","* Strong yen, weak sales hit profit * To launch Wii U console in major markets at year-end * Cuts unit sales forecasts for consoles, handheld devices * Slashes FY fcast to 45 bln yen loss vs consensus 4.2 bln yen loss (Adds comments, details) By Yoshiyuki Osada and Isabel Reynolds Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd posted a sharp drop in quarterly profit and forecast a bigger-than-expected full-year loss, its first at an operating level, as it battles a strong yen and its games devices lose ground to gadgets such as Apple's iPhone. The creator of the Super Mario franchise dominated the video games industry for years with its DS handheld players and Wii home consoles, but is now struggling to keep up as more versatile smartphone and tablet sales boom. ""To say that (the days of consoles) are over is likely an overstatement, but social network and Internet delivered games are growing and structurally changing the future of the industry, which is a strong wind against Nintendo,"" said Shigeo Sugawara, senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management. Nintendo now expects an annual operating loss of 45 billion yen ($575 million), dwarfing expectations of a 4.2 billion yen loss, based on the average of 21 analyst forecasts. ""Their time of growth (from consoles) is over, and, while I don't think the company will cease to exist, if they don't move into new categories, they will no doubt lose the great scale they've amassed,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo. ` Nintendo cut its forecast for annual sales of its ageing Wii console to 10 million devices from 12 million, and for the 3DS handheld games device to 14 million from 16 million. ""We had higher expectations for the year-end season, but failed to meet them,"" President Satoru Iwata told reporters in Osaka. Poor sales forced Nintendo to slash the price of its much-anticipated 3DS handheld games device in August, just six months after its launch. The move halted its record of making profits on games hardware as well as software, a business model that took operating income to a high of 555 billion yen in 2008/09. Nintendo also faces tougher competition in the home console market from Sony Corp's Move and Microsoft Corp's Kinect, and Iwata said consumers were more eager than ever to seek out bargains in the harsh economic environment. The company plans to launch the Wii's successor, the Wii U, in Japan, the United States, Europe and Australia in the year-end season, Iwata told reporters. But with cloud-based gaming emerging as a potential threat, Nintendo may have trouble generating excitement about its new product, some analysts say. Google is taking steps into gaming with Google TV, while Apple is thought to be preparing a new iPad and possibly a smart TV that could be game-changers for the industry. ""We think we need to consider the possibility that home consoles could become a thing of the past,"" Citigroup analyst Soichiro Fukuda wrote in a recent report. ""We think the direction taken by marketing trendsetter Apple will be very important and we will be watching the company's announcements at future events with interest."" PROFIT FALLS Nintendo's profit slumped to 40.9 billion yen for the traditionally strong October-December period, compared with a consensus estimate for 52 billion yen, based on a survey of three analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results came a day after Apple blew away Wall Street's expectations with its own quarterly earnings. Shares in Nintendo have halved to below 11,000 yen since the beginning of the financial year in April, hit by weak 3DS sales and market disappointment with the Wii U next-generation home console, unveiled at the E3 games show in June and set to go on sale late this year. At their peak, in late 2007, the shares traded at 73,200 yen. Last week, the stock dipped to 10,020 yen, the lowest since April 2004, before either the DS or Wii were launched.

201201,"UPDATE 1-Japan's NEC says to slash 10,000 jobs","(Adds detail) TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - NEC Corp said Thursday it will slash 10,000 jobs, almost one in 10 of its workers, to trim costs after the electronics maker announced a loss of 87 billion yen ($1.11 billion) for the three months to Dec. 31. The company, which employs 115,840 people worldwide, said it will book a 40 billion yen charge in the business year ending on March 31 to pay for the restructuring. It blamed its poor performance on tougher competition in the telecoms infrastructure business in Japan from foreign rivals, weak demand for its smartphones and difficulty in expanding operations overseas. The company, which also cut its forecast for mobile phone sales for the business year to 5 million from 6.5 million, said 7,000 of the job losses would be in Japan.

201201,Real Bonding With Family Around the TV Via Skype,"As you read these words, millions of people are conducting video chats using the popular Skype service, now owned by Microsoft. Most of these calls are low-resolution encounters between two individuals, conducted over personal computers. This week, I tested a new device that aims to transform Skype video chats into room-size experiences, involving whole families or groups of friends on each end—seeing each other, chatting and sharing photos in high definition using TVs. It's called telyHD, and comes from a small Silicon Valley start-up called Tely Labs. In my tests, it worked well. This TV add-on product is a black, horizontal bar less than a foot long and under 3 inches high with a wide-angle lens and multiple built-in microphones. It installs quickly and easily—typically on top of the TV—and is controlled by a remote from across the room that can be used to place and answer calls, and to zoom and pan your image. It can connect to any other Skype-enabled device—including PCs, Macs, smartphones and tablets—but some of its advanced features require a telyHD on both sides of the conversation. The $250 telyHD isn't just a different way to use Skype. It's part of the race to reinvent the television—to make it a smarter, more versatile digital device. So-called smart TVs, Internet-enabled sets that connect to the Web and run apps, are offered by most major manufacturers. The telyHD device brings added functionality and connectivity to existing ""dumb"" HDTVs that lack built-in online features. There is no monthly fee or subscription required by Tely Labs, and video calls between a telyHD and any other Skype device, including another telyHD, are free. You can also make free Skype-to-Skype audio calls, and audio calls to regular phones can be made at Skype's normal rates. I've been testing telyHD in my family room on my aging Pioneer 50-inch plasma HDTV. I made multiple calls to people at the company using other telyHD units. And, with my wife at my side, in our usual seats, we made video calls to each of our out-of-state children, who were using Skype-equipped computers. On our end of the calls, we didn't have to crowd around a laptop webcam, jump up to fiddle with the unit, or do anything different than if we had been watching TV. Our kids reported they could see and hear us both fine, even though we were about 10 feet from the camera. One person I tested with did report some audio feedback on her computer. I can say that telyHD worked as advertised, and provided good, generally smooth experiences on every call, whether I used a wired network connection or Wi-Fi on my end. The calls to other telyHDs appeared in high definition on our screen, though the calls to computers were lower resolution, as with many Skype calls. And, if you're concerned about rogue invasions of privacy, the telyHD has a sliding plastic shield to cover the camera when not in use. You can buy telyHD from the company's site, tely.com, or at Skype.com or Amazon.com. Ironically, it is hitting the market shortly after Cisco stopped selling a somewhat similar home video-calling product. Cisco's product cost much more, wasn't tied into Skype and carried a monthly fee. TelyHD isn't just a webcam. It's a small computing device, powered by Google's Android operating system. It contains software and Internet capabilities most TVs lack, some of which go beyond simple video calls. For instance, when contacting other telyHD units, I was able to send and receive video voice mails. And I was able to plug into the telyHD a flash memory card filled with pictures. I could share the pictures with another telyHD user and vice versa. I could even choose to copy a photo from the other party onto my own memory card. You can do the same thing with a USB drive. (TelyHD isn't the only way to use Skype for a whole-room view from a TV. Some of the new smart TVs, and even some Blu-ray players, come equipped with Skype software. When paired with a webcam, they, too, can conduct Skype video calls via the TV. I didn't test these for this column.) TelyHD can be placed on top of the TV, on a shelf, or on a tripod. It requires a broadband Internet connection, either wired or wireless, and an HDMI port on the TV, which is common on HDTVs. It mounts on top of even thin TVs using a built-in clamp that doesn't require tools. I set up my test unit in about 15 minutes. The system can't be used simultaneously with regular TV-watching. Just as with a DVD player, you must switch to a separate ""input"" on your TV to bring it up. When you do, it signs you into your Skype account and fills the screen with a carousel of big cards representing your Skype contacts. You click on a card with the remote to place or answer a call. There are various screen layouts you can choose, including a small window that shows what you look like to others and windows that show tips on what the remote buttons do. My only serious complaint with telyHD is that the remote control seems cheap, with hard-to-press buttons. But the company says it has designed an improved remote and will offer this new one free to existing owners. Also, as with many TV services, it's a pain to peck out user names, or searches, on an on-screen keyboard. And I found a bug in which the unit didn't recognize certain Wi-Fi network names, but the company fixed it earlier this week. Tely Labs plans more versions of telyHD and more features. A pricier model for small businesses is in the works, which will allow live file sharing, and have a better camera and a keyboard. A second software version also is coming. It will allow the unit to send to the TV screen video from Apple's iPad and will also support photo sharing from online services. The company is working on allowing video calling among up to 10 devices, though that will carry a fee. I can recommend telyHD for people with HDTVs who want to move their Skype video calling to where whole groups can get into the picture.

201201,Earnings: DuPont's Profit Declines Slightly,"E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co.'s fourth-quarter profit edged lower as the diversified manufacturer posted weaker volume but was aided by better pricing, which it used to offset higher raw material costs. DuPont said Tuesday that it expects customers in the consumer-electronics sector to continue destocking ahead of a midyear recovery as new smartphones come to market, though the outlook is brighter for other industrial users, notably in North America. The company was among the first to highlight tight inventory management by customers at the end of 2011, though volume declines have been partially offset by passing on higher raw material costs. Chief Executive Ellen Kullman said on a conference call that the destocking was driven by cash conservation rather than underlying demand, with customers expected to resume purchases in the second quarter. DuPont left its 2012 profit guidance unchanged at $4.20 to $4.40 a share as it fell short of analysts' expectations with a 0.8% drop in fourth-quarter earnings despite cutting its own guidance last month. The company's expanded nutrition segment and continued strength in seeds and crop protection have helped insulate some of the declines in coatings for consumer electronics equipment and photovoltaic solar cells. DuPont is the first of large diversified chemical producers to report and offer 2012 guidance in what analysts expect to be a year of volatile earnings and sluggish growth. Sales in its performance chemicals unit -- including the titanium dioxide pigment widely seen as a bellwether of broader industrial production -- are seen rising modestly in the first quarter and for the full year, driven by higher prices. DuPont reported fourth quarter profit of $373 million compared with $376 million a year earlier. In both periods, per-share earnings were flat at 40 cents. Net sales were up 14% in the quarter, with volume down 10% and prices up 14%.  Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,Apple Message to Wall Street: iWin,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary] Apple is breaking the law of large numbers. With revenue up 73% in the quarter through December to $46 billion, the tech giant eclipsed analysts' expectations by an extraordinary $7 billion. The amount by which it beat expectations easily tops the entire quarterly revenue of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion. Thanks to the release of the iPhone 4S, Apple sold 37 million handsets in the quarter. That nearly doubles the company's previous record for handset-unit sales, set two quarters ago. Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston estimates that Apple's share of the smartphone market jumped to 25%, up from the previous record of 18% two quarters ago. And last quarter included no sales of the iPhone 4S in China. The model wasn't released there until this quarter. Meanwhile, the release of Amazon's cheaper Kindle Fire tablet didn't slow the iPad. Apple sold 15.4 million tablets, up 38% from the previous quarter. Perhaps most amazing, Apple generated $16 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, leaving the company with a cash pile of $97.6 billion. That is larger than the market capitalizations of about 95% of companies in the S&P 500. Shareholders are surely anxious about what Apple will do with its cash and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer says the company is ""actively discussing"" what to do with it. Understanding the potential of the iPhone, which was 53% of sales in the December quarter, is key to understanding the potential path for the stock. And it certainly still has room to run. While Apple's handset now is offered by most carriers in North America and Western Europe, Mr. Mawston notes Apple can still expand distribution in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. There also is China, where the iPhone is only sold through No. 2 carrier China Unicom, which has about 20% share of China's mobile subscriptions. Larger carrier China Mobile, with nearly 70% share, offers a big opportunity. However, investors can't expect the iPhone to officially hit China Mobile shelves soon. Current iPhone models aren't compatible with its 3G network. China Mobile needs to roll out a next generation LTE network, meanwhile Apple has to release an LTE-enabled model -- something expected later this year. Another limiting factor is the iPhone's cost. Among the most expensive smartphones in the market, iPhones are typically purchased by those on postpaid calling plans. Three quarters of the China market, and more of India's, is comprised of prepaid subscribers. To appeal to these customers, Apple will have to sell a scaled down iPhone that would surely sport lower margins than existing models. Still that would offer an additional opportunity to expand its potential market. With that still to look forward to, no wonder Apple is the Exxon of mobile. And, following its 8% after-market gain, it again passes the oil major as America's most valuable company. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,Apple Sets New Bar for Industry,"Apple Inc., reporting results for the first quarter ending after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs, hit new sales and profit records based on runaway holiday demand for its iPhone and iPad tablet devices. The Cupertino, Calif., technology maker posted one of the most profitable quarters for a U.S. corporation, pulling in $13.1 billion on sales of $46.3 billion. Apple's profit is more than three times what General Electric Co. earned in its most recent quarter. ExxonMobil Corp. had a profit of $14.8 billion in the third quarter of 2008 but it needed nearly $140 billion in revenue to generate that income. Apple's executives said the numbers could have been even higher if the company had been able to manufacture enough iPhones to meet demand. Sales rose 73% during the quarter ended in December, up from $26.7 billion a year earlier. Profits more than doubled to $13.87 per share, up from $6.43 a share a year ago. The figures blew away analysts' projections, which estimated quarterly profits to hit around $9.6 billion. The performance also raises the bar for both Apple and its peers, setting new highs that may be tough to duplicate or sustain. The results brought Apple's cash hoard to $97.6 billion, more than the market capitalizations of all but 52 publicly traded companies, according to Capital IQ. Behind the strong showing were brisk sales of its hand-held devices. Overall, Apple sold 37 million iPhones and 15.4 million iPads during the quarter. Apple's shares were up nearly 8% in after-hours trading to $453.30. The results brush off some gloom from last quarter, when iPhone sales came up short of expectations as consumers held out to buy a newer iPhone model. At the time, CEO Tim Cook set high expectations for the holiday quarter, saying it would be record-breaking. Apple met them, as it introduced the iPhone 4S, and Sprint Nextel Corp. started selling iPhones for the first time. Apple is benefiting from a booming market. While many of its competitors have yet to report holiday sales, Forrester Research said ownership of tablets nearly doubled over the holidays, to 19% of U.S. adults in early January from 10% in mid-December. While consumers are still buying more phones powered by Google's Android operating system than iPhones by a significant margin, Apple made some gains in the recent quarter. Around 46.9% of consumers bought an Android smartphone in the three months ending in December, compared to 44.5% who bought iPhones, according to Nielsen, which surveys consumers. In October, the spread was bigger: 61.6% purchased an Android device and 25.1% purchased an iPhone. Now the onus is on Apple to continue keeping up with sky-high expectations. Some investors said Apple must tap some big new markets to keep up its record-breaking growth. The company has its eye on televisions and it is expected to release a new iPad this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has declined to comment. Amid management changes and tough competition, the results demonstrate how the company is widening the gap between itself and other technology players. While rivals from Samsung Electronics Co. to Amazon.com Inc. have jumped into the same fields with tablets, phones and media services, Apple continues to fend off competitors, even without major hardware upgrades and the marketing panache of Mr. Jobs, who died in October. ""Demand for iPhones and iPads was off the charts for the quarter,"" said Apple chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer in an interview. He added that Apple struggled to meet demand for its iPhones and that the device was on ""significant"" backlog at the end of the quarter. The results also highlight a shifting tech landscape. On Sunday, BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. said it was replacing its two longtime co-chief executives, with the device losing ground to the iPhone in recent years. Last year, Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. agreed to sell itself to Google Inc., whose Android software is one of Apple's biggest threats. Apple signaled that it wasn't concerned its streak would end anytime soon. The company, which has traditionally been conservative with its forecasts, provided an outlook for the current quarter ending in late March that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Apple said it expects fiscal second-quarter earnings of about $8.50 a share on revenue of about $32.5 billion, above analyst estimates of profit of $8.04 a share on $32.1 billion in revenue, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. ""Apple's momentum is incredibly strong and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline,"" Mr. Cook said in a statement. Over the quarter, Apple's business not only benefited from stronger demand but also lower component costs, highlighting how the company's supply chain remains an advantage over rivals. Apple's gross margin widened to 44.7% from 38.5% in the year-ago quarter, as Mr. Cook said the company's component costs had fallen significantly. Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones, said falling component costs benefited Apple more than other companies because its cash allows it to buy at a greater scale, as does the fact it uses similar parts across its product lines. On a call with analysts, Mr. Cook said that iPhone sales were particularly strong in the U.S. and Japan. ""It turns out we didn't bet high enough,"" he said. IPhone sales in China were also very strong, he said. Sales of the iPad were a large contributor, more than doubling from the previous year's quarter even as less expensive new competitors, such as Amazon.com's Kindle Fire tablet, hit the market during the holiday season.

201201,"Apple, Aided by an iPhone Frenzy, Doubles Its Quarterly Profit","It turns out Apple didn't need an iPhone 5 to bolster sales. The company reported on Tuesday that its profit for the holiday quarter more than doubled. And that was largely thanks to sales of the iPhone 4S, which, when it was introduced in October, was greeted with grumbling from pundits and some users for lacking the razzle-dazzle that many imagined an iPhone 5 would bring. But consumers still came out in droves to buy the iPhone 4S, helping the company sell more than double the number of iPhones for the quarter ending Dec. 31 than it did a year ago, a figure that was also lifted by sales of cheap, older models of Apple's cellphone. With the 37 million iPhones that customers snapped up over the holidays, Apple has sold 183 million of the devices since the product went on sale in 2007. Revenue from the iPhone and iPad -- neither of which could be bought five years ago -- now accounts for 72 percent of Apple's total revenue, underscoring the transformation of the company. And although phones based on Google's Android operating system had been gaining more customers in recent years, Apple has begun to chip away at some of the advantages of these phones, narrowing Android's lead in the United States over the holidays. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, described the customer response to the new iPhone as ''breathtaking'' and said the company could not meet global demand for the device despite producing a record number of iPhones. ''As it turns out, we didn't bet high enough,'' Mr. Cook said. The supporting act in Apple's product lineup -- the iPad -- also had a record quarter, with the company selling 15.4 million of its tablet devices over the holidays, more than double the number it sold during the same period the year before. After watching competitors stumble for the last two years, Apple faced its first credible competition in the tablet computer category this fall when Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire. The $199 device from the Internet retailer is significantly cheaper than the $499 starting price for the iPad and is closely linked to various Amazon online offerings including its e-book store, movie and music services. Mr. Cook said Apple's iPad sales were not hurt by Amazon's Kindle products, which have less computing power and are missing features like cameras for now. ''Customers will buy those and they'll sell a fair number of units,'' he said. ''But I don't think people who want iPads will settle for limited functions.'' The rosy results sent Apple shares soaring more than 7 percent in after-hours trading to more than $450 each. The jump increased the total value of Apple's shares to more than $426 billion, pushing its market value past that of Exxon Mobil and making it the most highly valued company. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., said its net income for the period rose 118 percent to $13.06 billion, or $13.87 a share, compared with net income of $6 billion, or $6.43 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 73 percent to $46.33 billion, from $26.74 billion a year ago. Apple's results were inflated slightly because its 2011 holiday quarter included 14 weeks of sales, rather than the 13 weeks in 2010, because of a change by the company. The results were better than the $10.08 a share in earnings and $38.85 billion in revenue expected by analysts, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Apple had forecast earnings of $9.30 a share and $37 billion for the quarter. ''It almost defies words in terms of the strength across all products,'' said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Everything about it eclipsed even the wildest expectations of analysts.'' Apple said it sold 5.2 million Macintoshes during the holiday quarter, 26 percent more than it did a year earlier. The performance of Apple's iPhone business underscores how the company has thrived in the mobile phone market, even as Google steadily nibbled away at the iPhone's share of smartphones in recent years with handsets based on the Android operating system. Not only are Android phones made by a wide array of manufacturers, they have had wider distribution on carrier networks. The iPhone was initially limited to AT&T's network in the United States and exclusive relationships with other carriers elsewhere in the world. But the iPhone is now available on the three largest wireless networks in the United States, with the addition of Sprint in the fall. And after it introduced the iPhone 4S, Apple also made its older iPhone 4 available for $99 and iPhone 3GS free with contracts through wireless carriers. Analysts say they think the move expanded the audience of potential iPhone buyers beyond people willing to spend $199 for Apple's latest model of smartphone. There are signs that Apple's strategy helped narrow Android's lead in the market over the holidays. Nielsen, the audience measurement firm, said in a recent report that 61.6 percent of United States smartphone consumers surveyed in October said they had gotten an Android phone within the last three months, while only 25.1 percent got an iPhone. By December, though, Android's lead among people who had acquired a smartphone recently had narrowed to 46.9 percent while 44.5 percent of consumers said they had bought an iPhone, Nielsen said. About 57 percent of iPhone owners in December said they got the new iPhone 4S, while the rest, 43 percent, got older iPhones. The iPhone 4S was initially derided by some critics for offering little improvement on the iPhone 4, with none of the bold outward design changes that make it easy for cellphone users to brag about owning the latest Apple gizmo. On the inside, though, the product has a better camera, faster microprocessor and a virtual assistant called Siri that lets people dictate texts and do Web searches with voice commands. Apple said it expects to report earnings of $8.50 a share and revenue of about $32.5 billion during the fiscal second quarter. Apple's cash and securities ballooned to nearly $100 billion, an eye-popping sum that is likely to revive calls for Apple to return some of the hoard to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's chief financial officer, told analysts that the company and its board of directors are ''actively discussing'' uses of the cash, including potential acquisitions and further investments in the company's supply chain. ''We're not letting it burn a hole in our pockets,'' he said. PHOTO: An Apple store in San Francisco. The new iPhone 4S and the iPad were wildly popular in the last quarter of 2011.

201201,"Smartphone Sales Are Strong, but Verizon Has a Loss","CORRECTION APPENDED Verizon Communications on Tuesday reported rising iPhone sales and revenue growth in its wireless business, but it booked a quarterly loss, primarily because of previously announced pension charges. The company reported a net loss of $2 billion, or 71 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 2011, in contrast to net income of $2.64 billion, or 93 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue climbed 7.7 percent, to $28.44 billion in the quarter, from $26.4 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Adjusted for the pension charges, the income was 52 cents a share, just below the average forecast of 53 cents from analysts. Revenue was right in line with expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. Shares of Verizon fell 61 cents, to $37.79. ''Verizon finished 2011 very strong, both in terms of revenue growth and by delivering an 18.2 percent total return to our shareholders for the full year, and the company has great momentum for 2012,'' Lowell C. McAdam, Verizon's chief executive, said in a statement. The company said strong sales of smartphones drove its wireless business to its best quarterly growth rate ever, up 13 percent to $18.3 billion in revenue. Verizon sold 7.7 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, 4.2 million of which were iPhones. The company added 1.5 million wireless subscribers over the quarter, bringing its total subscriber count to 108.7 million. ''We have great momentum in wireless, and we expect to build on that strength,'' said Francis J. Shammo, chief financial officer of Verizon, during a conference call after the earnings report was released. Profit margins, however, dropped because of the high subsidies that Verizon pays for each new iPhone bought by customers when they commit to a two-year contract. Wireless carriers subsidize a part of the retail price on most new cellphones to attract customers. The companies recoup the costs over the duration of the customer's contract. Verizon said this week that it had a large lead over its rival AT&T in the race to build out a newer, faster network called 4G Long Term Evolution, or LTE. The company says it now has LTE networks deployed in 195 markets, compared with AT&T's 26 markets, and it plans to make coverage from such so-called fourth-generation networks as ubiquitous as its older third-generation networks by mid-2013. Verizon said it sold 2.4 million 4G devices in the fourth quarter. Mr. Shammo added that Verizon's wireless business intends to expand in the business market, as the company is planning wireless innovations for automobiles, health care and energy conservation. He said Verizon is advancing its lead in 4G at a time when AT&T is trying to obtain more spectrum needed to expand its networks. In one effort to gain spectrum, AT&T tried to merge with T-Mobile USA, but eventually withdrew the bid after it faced resistance from government agencies over antitrust concerns. While AT&T was pursuing the merger, Verizon made a deal with a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast and Time Warner, for $3.6 billion worth of spectrum. Though AT&T is far behind in acquiring spectrum, it is not out of the 4G game, said Christopher C. King, a telecom analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. The company still has enough spectrum to deploy its nationwide 4G LTE network. Verizon's wireline business, which includes traditional landlines, continued to shrink. Quarterly revenue decreased 1.5 percent, to $10.14 billion. To Simon Leopold, an analyst at Morgan Keegan, Verizon's aggressive pursuit of 4G networks symbolizes its continued investment in superior technologies to attract consumers and beat rivals. '' 'It's the network' is not just a tagline with Verizon,'' Mr. Leopold said. ''It's something that's deep within their culture.'' Verizon's expansion of 4G will probably create new opportunities for makers of networking equipment, like Cisco, Alcatel Lucent and Juniper, meaning consumers can expect a wave of new devices compatible with the faster network in the coming year, Mr. Leopold said.

201201,Apple and Verizon Earnings Underscore the Power of the iPhone; Bits,"Apple and Verizon on Tuesday reported their quarterly earnings, and for both companies, much of their good news centered on one product: the iPhone. And the numbers tell the story of a device that seems to gain power each day. Apple said it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter ending Dec. 31 - the most ever sold in a single quarter. The Next Web points out that at that rate, more iPhones were being sold than babies were being born in the world every day. Verizon said the iPhone was the best-selling smartphone in its portfolio. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said the iPhone 4S accounted for the majority of iPhone sales - a statement that takes on significance when you consider that with a two-year contract, the iPhone 3GS is free, and the iPhone 4 costs $100. Even in a down economy and with a free iPhone in its portfolio, Apple still managed to sell the expensive, newer 4S to most of its customers. Yet the free and reduced-price iPhones are still important to the company's business. Tero Kuittinen, a senior analyst at MGI Research, said the free iPhone 3GS gave Apple the opportunity to expand aggressively into markets where smartphones are not as popular yet, like China and Africa. Jan Dawson, an analyst with Ovum, said not to underestimate the power of the free iPhone 3GS and the cheaper iPhone 4. ""You'd better believe the other iPhones are selling, too,"" he said. ""They're suddenly competitive with the lower-end smartphones that you used to get if you couldn't afford an iPhone, which makes those other phones pretty unappealing."" As for Verizon, Francis J. Shammo, chief financial officer of Verizon Communications, said that out of the 7.7 million smartphones sold by Verizon during the quarter, 4.2 million were iPhones. So customers are going for the iPhone despite Verizon's aggressive portfolio of the hottest Android smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and the Motorola Droid Razr. Both of those smartphones have bigger screens than the iPhone, and are compatible with Verizon's faster 4G LTE network. But it seems that consumers care more about an overall experience and a brand than they do about hardware specs, Mr. Dawson said. Over all, Apple raked in a profit of $13 billion for the quarter, and its market value surpassed Exxon Mobil's to make it the most highly valued company. * Carrier Rivalry Sharpens as iPhone Comes to Sprint * The Buzz on the Verizon iPhone Announcement * Will the Verizon iPhone Cripple Verizon? * Are AT&T and Verizon About to Square Off Over Pricing? * Testing the Android Waters The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120125e81p006sh ",NYT Blogs,25 January 2012,465 words,apple verizon earnings underscore power iphone bit,apple verizon tuesday reported quarterly earnings company much good news centered one product iphone number tell story device seems power day said sold million iphones quarter ending dec ever next web point rate iphones baby born world every verizon iphone bestselling smartphone portfolio tim cook chief executive iphone accounted majority iphone sale statement take significance twoyear iphone g free iphone cost even economy iphone managed expensive newer customer reducedprice iphones important business tero kuittinen senior analyst mgi research iphone gave opportunity expand aggressively market smartphones popular like china africa jan dawson ovum underestimate iphone cheaper iphone youd better believe iphones selling theyre suddenly competitive lowerend smartphones used couldnt iphone phone pretty unappealing verizon francis j shammo financial officer verizon communication smartphones verizon iphones going iphone despite verizons aggressive hottest android smartphones samsung galaxy nexus motorola droid razr smartphones bigger screen iphone compatible verizons faster lte seems consumer overall experience brand hardware spec mr dawson raked surpassed exxon mobils highly valued carrier rivalry sharpens iphone sprint buzz verizon iphone announcement verizon iphone cripple verizon att verizon square pricing testing water york time document nytbepsh
201201,Two on RIM's Rescue Team Face Turnaround Test,"In his bid to revive Research In Motion Ltd., Thorsten Heins, the new CEO, will lean on both a woman who helped bring the Toronto Stock Exchange into the modern age and a man who is often called Canada's version of Warren Buffett. Barbara Stymiest steps in as RIM's new nonexecutive chairwoman after the company announced its longtime co-chief executives and co-chairmen Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis were stepping down. Her stint as chief executive of the Toronto exchange, beleaguered by technology shortcomings at the time, won her a reputation as a turnaround artist and a force in the city's sometimes-clubby business and financial circles. She is joined on the board by RIM's newest nonexecutive director, Prem Watsa, the chief executive of Canadian investment giant Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. Often compared to U.S. investment guru Warren Buffett, Mr. Watsa over the years has focused on beaten-up stocks -- including at times, his own -- and has explained his choices in plainly written annual reports. As head of Hamblin Watsa Investment Counsel Ltd., Mr. Watsa owns about 11.8 million RIM shares, or a 2.3% stake, as of the end of September, according to FactSet. That makes the money manager the fourth-largest shareholder in the BlackBerry maker. Together, the newly announced leadership team, drawn mostly from inside the current board room and executive suite -- wasn't enough to convince investors that RIM has turned a corner in its struggle to remain competitive in the smartphone market. RIM shares sank about 8.5% Monday, and were down another 3.3% at $15.04 midday Tuesday. ""We are surprised RIM has decided to go with an operations-minded insider"" as chief executive, analysts at UBS wrote. ""Especially since we consider the challenges tied more to strategy."" Ms. Stymiest defended the approach in an interview Monday. ""The directors believe that the company has a very solid future with great products, good plans and a great new leader in place to take us to the next phase,"" she said. In 1999, Ms. Stymiest, now 55 yerars old, became CEO of the Toronto exchange, charged with turning around, as one local paper described it at the time, a technological laggard ""fit for a Third World backwater"" and sprucing it up for sale. She modernized the exchange, expanded it into bond and energy trading and folded in the Alberta and Vancouver exchanges. Mr. Watsa, 61, is a possible agent of change at the company, though he appears to be backing Mr. Heins's strategy so far. Mr. Watsa doesn't have a history of strident, public activism. In an interview Sunday, Mr. Watsa said he recently bought up RIM shares because of his belief in the long-term value of the company.

201201,RIM CEO Choice Disappoints Investors --- Thorsten Heins Says 'Seismic Changes' Aren't Planned for Research In Motion; Company's Share Price Slumps,"TORONTO -- Thorsten Heins, the new chief of Research In Motion Ltd., didn't win an endorsement from shareholders on his first days on the job, but executives who know him say his reputation for execution may be just what the BlackBerry maker needs as it rolls out a make-or-break new operating system later this year. Mr. Heins has worked at RIM since 2007, most recently as the senior of two chief operating officers. On a conference call Monday, he immediately emphasized that he will mostly follow the path set by his predecessors, co-Chairmen and co-Chief Executives Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. He told analysts not to expect ""seismic changes"" and ruled out splitting up the company. Mr. Heins said he was focused on getting out the company's newest line of phones, to be run off its latest operating system, BlackBerry 10. ""I will not in any way split this up or separate this into different businesses,"" Mr. Heins said. ""If there [are] requests coming towards Research In Motion to talk about licensing that platform to other companies, I will entertain those discussions. I will listen."" That message didn't sit well with investors, who sent RIM's stock price 8.5% lower to $15.56 on Monday; by midday Tuesday, it was off another 3.3%. Many analysts doubted whether Mr. Heins could push through the kind of dramatic changes many critics say RIM needs to stay competitive with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Mr. Heins conceded on Monday that RIM needs to improve its marketing message, particularly in the U.S., and execute better with product rollout, and said he was looking for a chief marketing officer. The new CEO will have his work cut out for him. RIM's share of the U.S. smartphone market has dipped below 10% and has had a number of product delays. While Mr. Heins has largely stayed out of the limelight during his tenure, deferring to his two former bosses, executives who have worked with him say he's execution driven and a stickler for deadlines. He also clashed at times with his two bosses, growing frustrated at being kept out of the loop in key projects, according to these executives. A RIM spokesman countered, saying the executives didn't clash. Mr. Heins is an even-tempered, methodical manager, a ""get-it-done"" kind of guy, according to one person close to him. For fun, he rides a BMW motorcycle and is a fan of the Miami Heat. Mr. Heins, 54 years old, joined Siemens AG straight from college, in Hannover, Germany. He worked his way up the Siemens ladder over 23 years, at one point running its handset division, and eventually rose to become the company's chief technology officer. He first came in contact with RIM executives while at Siemens, when he worked on a deal in 2004 that saw the two companies partner on software for phones. In 2007, Mr. Heins was recruited by former RIM executive Larry Conlee to steer the company's fast-growing smartphone division. Mr. Heins says he ignored calls from headhunters for years until the offer of a COO job from RIM came in 2007, according to a RIM statement Sunday. Soon after joining RIM, Mr. Heins was put in charge of the hardware for the BlackBerry 6 and 7 lines of phones, among other tasks. But he grew frustrated with the management style of Messrs. Lazaradis and Balsillie, according to people familiar with the matter. When RIM acquired the operating system QNX, for example, Mr. Lazaridis didn't include Mr. Heins in key meetings and instead ""hived out"" a small number of employees to work on the project outside of normal company channels, according to a person familiar with the matter. A company spokesman said there were no clashes between the executives, but rather Mr. Lazaradis and Mr. Heins met and decided to divide their focus on QNX and BB7 to make better use of time. The spokesman said Mr. Heins was happy with this arrangement. ""There were plenty of occasions when he could have walked out the door, and there would have been open arms [from other companies] for someone of his quality,"" according to the person close to Mr. Heins. ""He did very quietly voice frustration with colleagues, but to his credit he stayed.""

201201,Heard on the Street / Financial Analysis and Commentary,"Japan TV-Set Makers Not Such a Smart Bet For Japan's electronics makers, the only ""smart"" television set is one sold by a rival. Lousy margins on TV sets have cost companies billions of dollars in losses in recent years. Sony, for example, has racked up more than $6 billion in red ink in the past seven years and forecasts an additional $3 billion in losses over the next two years. To stem losses, Hitachi said Monday that it will end TV-set production in Japan and outsource it later this year. The hype says that will soon change. Some reviews of smart-television sets at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month were giddy. The industry hopes the new technology will change the commodified TV-set business by putting a floor under prices, stimulating demand and differentiating higher-margin devices from low-cost products. The industry had similar expectations in the past, such as when consumers moved in droves from bulky picture tubes to sleek flat panels. But that isn't how it panned out in recent years. Most shoppers weren't willing to pay for the frills, and low-cost products flooded the market. The case for smart-television sets is still in its early stages. There is work to be done generating content and getting the user interface to a decent standard. Even if manufacturers get the technology right, buyers may not want to juggle another device. And while these sets are supposed to bring the tablet and smartphone experience to the living room, the fact is that smartphones and tablets are already there. Meanwhile, the makers of TV sets should be asking themselves one question: What will Apple do? Apple is the leader in smart technologies. It has been quiet on smart-TV sets but surely won't concede an emerging segment to its rivals if there are profits to be made. Over the next four years, global demand for TV sets will drop by more than 6% to $108 billion, DisplaySearch forecasts. World-wide sales peaked at $118 billion in 2010. But weaning Japan's electronics companies off TV sets is no easy task. They still account for a decent share of revenue, representing about a quarter of sales at Sharp, one-fifth at Sony, and about a tenth or less at both Panasonic and Toshiba. So far, though, smart-TV sets don't look like an intelligent solution to falling profitability. -- James Simms Speeding Dragon, Hidden Debt Pile Objects in the rearview mirror may be closer than they appear, but China's rapid growth means objects in the rear view of the world's economic powerhouse are actually shrinking at a rapid rate. In 2011, China's gross domestic product came in at 47.1 trillion yuan ($7.4 trillion). That represented nominal growth of 17.5% from 2010, a blistering pace that makes many of the problems of debt and credit that trouble investors and hang over valuations for Chinese stocks appear a little more manageable. Take local-government debt. The government's auditor put the number at 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010. That was equal to 26% of China's GDP. In 2011, it shrank to 22%. Even if weaker demand and reduced inflation mean a slightly lower nominal growth rate in 2012, by the end of the year, local-government debt could shrink to 19% of GDP. The debt may be creeping up, but not enough to push the ratio in the wrong direction. Investors also worry about China's credit binge, which saw the ratio of loans to GDP soar from 96% at the end of 2008 to 119% at the end of 2010, as loan growth ran far ahead of GDP. An expanding economy means that ratio is also moving in the right direction -- down to 116% in 2011. That reduction reflects the fact that banks' loan books are expanding, though not as fast as GDP. China's happy situation stands in stark contrast to those of neighbor Japan, crisis-ridden European countries and the U.S., where slow or even negative growth does little to make the debt problem smaller. Growth hides a multitude of sins. The trouble for China's competitors is that achieving any significant increase in nominal growth without a large portion coming from higher inflation looks hard to do. -- Tom Orlik Slowdown in India Belies A Long Inflation Battle It's tough to envy India's central bank right now, but it is making the right calls in a very tough situation. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India kept interest rates unchanged despite a slowdown that has forced the bank to ratchet down expectations for India's economic growth to 7% for the year ending in March. It did reduce banks' cash reserve requirements to help ease a liquidity crunch, but said it is premature to cut policy interest rates. True, the latest figures show that the food inflation rate has been declining for two weeks. The monthly wholesale-price index rose at its slowest pace in more than a year in December, and industry lobbies are starting to call for easing interest rates. But there is hardly reason to start cutting just yet. Several factors will keep India's prices stubbornly high in coming years, despite intermittent dips in the headline rate. The central bank itself admits that any respite from price pressures will be short-lived. The reason is a chronic supply shortage, particularly in primary food items. A disorganized distribution network and disheveled infrastructure compound the shortage problem. In addition, as Indians earn more, they are consuming more protein-rich food, which also is in short supply. New Delhi won't help this year, as it has decided to spend freely on welfare and populist programs through critical provincial elections. Bad execution means this money ends up increasing people's spending capacity without addressing the chronic supply issue. The RBI called such expenditures ""unhealthy."" A shortage of skilled workers in the cities, thanks to India's flatfooted approach to investing in quality education, gives employees leverage to ask for sharp pay raises. A Nomura study shows wages rose by an average of 13.3% in India from 2005 to 2010, compared with 2.6% from 2000 to 2004. Also, import price pressures, mostly from fuel and energy -- India imports nearly two-thirds of what it consumes -- are worsening as the economy grows while the rupee remains weak. These leakages and the government's spendthrift nature won't change any time soon. Don't expect India's price situation to improve so quickly, either. -- Harsh Joshi License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Monday: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Tuesday: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Wednesday: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,"Apple doubles iPhone sales in holiday quarter, sailing past analyst estimates","NEW YORK (AP) - The iPhone is taking over Apple. For the first time, the device that changed how people use mobile phones, accounts for more than half of the behemoth company's sales. Apple Inc. on Tuesday said it sold 37 million iPhones in the last three months of 2011, vastly exceeding analyst estimates and propelling the company to record quarterly results. The phone accounted for 53 percent of Apple's revenue in the quarter. Though it has other hit products, like MacBooks and the iPad, they can't keep up with the iPhone, whose sales more than doubled over last year from an already high level. The sales mean Apple is set to regain the position it briefly held earlier last year of being the world's largest maker of smartphones. Nokia Corp., the earlier No. 1, in transition to a new generation of smartphones, and more recent competitor Samsung Electronics Co. has announced preliminary figure of 35 million smartphones sold in the October to December period. October saw Apple launching the iPhone 4S in the U.S. and some other countries. The phone was delayed for a few months, which meant that Apple's results for the July to September quarter were uncharacteristically tepid. It came back with a vengeance in the holiday season. On Tuesday, Apple said net income in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 31, was $13.06 billion, or $13.87 per share. That was up 118 percent from $6 billion, or $6.43 per share, a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting earnings of $10.04 per share for the latest quarter, Apple's fiscal first. Revenue was $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from a year ago. Analysts were expecting $38.9 billion. ""It was a pristine quarter,"" said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. ""The investment community has never seen a company like this, inside or outside technology."" The stellar performance could re-establish Apple as the world's most valuable company, again toppling Exxon Mobil Corp. Apple first unseated Exxon last summer, and the two have been trading places since then. Apple shares rose $30.67, or 7.3 percent, to $451.08 in extended trading, after the company released its results. If that rally sticks in Wednesday's regular trading sessions, Apple's market value will be hovering around $420 billion. Exxon's market value stood at $417.9 billion Tuesday, while Apple's was $391.9 billion at the end of regular trading. Apple shipped 15.4 million iPads in the quarter, again more than doubling sales over the same quarter last year. The November launch of Amazon.com Inc.'s $199 Kindle Fire tablet didn't appear to put much of a dent in the iPad's sales, as some analysts predicted it would. Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company expects earnings of $8.50 per share in the current quarter, and sales of $32.5 billion. Both figures are above the average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet, even though Apple usually low-balls its estimates. The Cupertino, Calif. company ended the quarter with a cash balance of a staggering $97.6 billion. That's more than enough to buy Citigroup Inc. outright, or issue a special dividend of $100 per Apple share. For years, investors have been frustrated with Apple's unwillingness to put the cash to use, but complaints have been muted as Apple continues to generate record-breaking results and as the stock price keeps rising. Apple executives have said the cash hoard gives the company flexibility to make acquisitions and long-term supply deals. Apple's results lifted shares of smaller companies that supply chips for the iPhone, like TriQuint Semiconductor, up 7.7 percent, Cirrus Logic Inc., up 6.8 percent, Broadcom Corp., up 4.2 percent, and Skyworks Solutions Inc., up 3.7 percent. Apple co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs died Oct. 5, just as the record-breaking quarter started. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201201,"Britain's FTSE gains, eyes on Fed","* FTSE 100 up 0.1 pct * ARM gets Apple earnings read-across * Miners up on U.S. infrastructure spend hopes By Tricia Wright LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Britain's top shares rose on Wednesday after earnings from consumer technology bellwether Apple boosted sentiment, as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will point to interest rates continuing at near zero for a sustained period of time. But UK fourth-quarter GDP figures, due at 0930 GMT, were seen tempering enthusiasm. The growth numbers are expected to show that Britain's economy contracted at the end of last year, pointing towards a mild recession and setting the stage for further stimulus by the Bank of England. Chip designer ARM Holdings was among the top blue-chip risers, up 4.1 percent, with traders citing a read-across from Apple's quarterly results, which blew past Wall Street's expectations, buoyed by sales of iPhones and iPads. ""It reads positively for ARM,"" said Didier Scemama at RBS. ""Apple is not the only customer of ARM -- they supply virtually every smartphone and tablet with their cheap designs -- but from a sentiment standpoint there has been a strong correlation between the two share prices."" The UK benchmark index was up 3.34 points, or 0.1 percent, at 5,755.24 by 0918 GMT, having dipped 0.5 percent on Tuesday. Investors were bullish ahead of the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, expected to result in forecasts showing interest rates will be near zero for at least two more years. ""If rates are kept at zero for a long time, investors have little option but to put money into interest-generating assets such as equities, because money kept in the bank is eroded by inflation,"" said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital. ""And it's not necessarily always the case that they will just buy into U.S. equities. That money does slosh around the global economy and some of it will filter over here as well."" Mining stocks added the most weight to the FTSE 100's gains, tracking an advance in key base metals prices, on hopes a potential boost to U.S. infrastructure spending will help the demand picture for raw materials. In his State of the Union address, U.S. President Barack Obama proposed to divert half the money America will save from the end of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan into high-speed rail lines and repairs to the nation's roads and infrastructure. Weakness among banks countered these gains, as worries about Greece potentially facing a messy default prompted further profit taking in the sector which has risen 13.6 percent this year, against a 3.2 percent rise on the FTSE 100. Royal Bank of Scotland led the sector lower, down 1.9 percent, after UBS cuts its rating on the majority state-owned lender to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", as it sees pressure mounting on the shares in the run up to results due on Feb. 23. While the UK market has kicked off 2012 on a bullish note, some investors were less than upbeat, citing concerns over the European sovereign debt crisis. ""The theme so far this year has been buying the underperformers of last year on the hope that the global economy, and especially China and Europe, have seen the bottom,"" said Lex van Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, which manages $500 million of assets. ""I would personally not chase it.""

201201,REFILE-UPDATE 4-Stellar Apple results point to a good year ahead,"(Refiles to fix typo in paragraph 1) * Fifteen brokerages raise price target * Citigroup raises price target by as much as $100 * New product introductions to add to growth story - analysts * Shares up 8 pct premarket By Supantha Mukherjee Jan 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc shares surged the most in more than three years, after skyrocketing iPhone and iPad sales helped the company smash Wall Street expectations, prompting analysts to raise their price targets on the stock by as much as $100. Shares of the company, which reported results for its first full quarter without charismatic founder Steve Jobs, were up as much as 8 percent in early trading to $454.45. At its highest, the share jump added nearly $32 billion to Apple's market value, helping the company overtake oil major Exxon Mobil Corp to become the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $430 billion. During the critical holiday quarter, Apple sold 37.04 million iPhones -- its flagship product -- and 15.43 million iPad tablets, doubling from a year earlier. ""Expectations ran rampant on the iPhone 4S' popularity around the world, and yet December's results reported last night were still ""staggering"" in comparison,"" Brigantine Advisors said in a note. At least 15 brokerages raised their price targets on the company's stock, with two expecting it to touch $650 in the next 12 months. Citigroup, which raised its price target on the stock by $100 to $600, expects ""another stellar product cycle this year with an iPad refresh in March."" The growth momentum should be driven by demand in China and low channel inventories, Citigroup analysts said. The quarter saw Apple's warchest of cash and securities swell to almost $100 billion -- raising speculation that Apple might use a portion its cash balance to pay back investors in the form of a dividend. Apple, which last paid dividend in 1995, is one of the few remaining cash-rich technology companies to resist dividend payments. Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said on Tuesday Apple was ""actively discussing"" the cash balance but didn't have anything to announce. ""We do believe the company should examine a meaningful dividend closely and are intrigued by the possibilities around any sizeable acquisitions that could improve its wireless and online services,"" Barclays Capital wrote in a note to clients. COOK CONSOLIDATES The results also plugged concerns that Apple might face a rougher ride than usual in 2012 due to competition from Google Inc's Android - a free software to run smartphones, and from a host of tablets available in the market. Lingering doubts about the ability of new Chief Executive Tim Cook to lead the company that Jobs built from a garage project into a global leader were also put to rest. J.P. Morgan Securities, which sees iPad as a ""budding growth engine"" for Apple, said the strong results suggest there is more than just one major product cycle at the company. Wedbush Securities expects a new sleeker iPad 3 to be introduced by the end of the first quarter and iPhone 5 to follow in the later part of the year. The new product introductions will only add to the growth story, analysts said. Barclays, which named Apple as its top pick in the IT hardware sector, also expects to hear more about the company's entry into the TV business this year. Of the 56 analysts covering the stock, more than 90 percent have a ""strong buy"" or a ""buy"" rating, with only two analysts rating it ""sell"" or ""strong sell"". Suppliers, such as Samsung Electronics, Qualcomm , Toshiba, basked in the reflection of Apple's glowing results.

201201,RPT-UPDATE 1-Core suppliers savour bigger Apple pie,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) * Apple US mkt share doubles to 44.9 pct -Kantar * Google Android share slips to 44.8 pct -Kantar * ARM, Imagination, Dialog rise around 4 pct * Apple to take smartphone crown from Samsung By Tarmo Virki Jan 25 (Reuters) - Suppliers basked in the reflection of Apple's glowing results on Wednesday after the company's gold standard iPhones and iPads flew off the shelves over the holiday sales season. Apple's forecast-beating fourth-quarter figures late on Tuesday helped it to beat Google's Android as the largest smartphone platform in the United States and to regain the world's largest smartphone maker spot from Samsung . Apple's results were spearheaded by sales of the iPhone 4S, which is packed with technology from British chip designer ARM , said analyst Nick James at Numis. Apple accounts for about 10 percent of ARM's technology revenues, and for about 35 percent of graphics and video chip designer Imagination's technology revenues, he said. ""It means people are still driven by performance in terms of having the highest performance, highest functioning devices, and those tend to have quite a number of ARM-based chips in them."" ""It is one of the key things that drove Imagination to come through to the next level,"" James added. Shares in ARM jumped 4.2 percent, while shares in Imagination were 4.1 percent higher at 1030 GMT. Analyst Didier Scemama at RBS said that although Apple was only one of many ARM customers -- the Cambridge-based company supplies virtually every smartphone and tablet with their cheap designs -- from a sentiment standpoint there has been a strong correlation between the two stocks. ""(Apple) should help the whole sector today, but especially Dialog Semiconductor and other suppliers,"" said a Frankfurt-based trader. Shares in Dialog Semi were up 3.9 percent. OVERTAKING SAMSUNG Samsung became the world's largest smartphone maker in the third quarter, but analysts said the 37 million iPhones sold in the fourth quarter should easily beat Samsung's expected sales of around 30 million. Samsung is due to report on Friday. Research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said Apple's share of the U.S. market doubled from a year ago to 44.9 percent in the October to December period, just beating the total for Android smartphones, which slipped to 44.8 percent from 50 percent. ""Overall, Apple sales are now growing at a faster rate than Android across the nine countries we cover,"" said Dominic Sunnebo, global consumer insight director at the research firm. Apple's iPhone 4S also uses chips from Samsung Electronics , Qualcomm, Toshiba and a host of smaller semiconductor companies, including TriQuint, Skyworks Solutions and Avago Technologies Inc. In stark contrast to Apple's success, sales of handset makers using Android, including Motorola Mobility, HTC and Sony Ericsson , have stumbled in the quarter.

201201,UPDATE 4-Ericsson Q4 profit halves as slowdown bites,"* Q4 core earnings 4.1 bln crowns vs forecast 7.4 bln * Q4 sales 63.7 bln crowns vs forecast 67.2 bln * Sees margins staying weak, customers cautious * Shares fall 15 pct, Alcatel drops 10 pct (Adds CEO, fresh analyst comment, updates share price) By Simon Johnson STOCKHOLM, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Ericsson, the world's biggest maker of equipment for mobile phone networks, stunned markets with a 50 percent drop in quarterly profit, adding to signs from the corporate world that economic growth may be grinding to a halt. Shares in the Swedish company dropped 15 percent to a three-year low after it reported fourth-quarter profits below even the gloomiest forecasts and warned telecoms operators were likely to remain cautious on spending in the months ahead. ""It is hard to find anything positive,"" said Jyske Bank analyst Robert Jakobsen. ""The company has indicated there would be a slowdown, but this is much worse than expected."" The gloomy news from Ericsson adds to signs from the latest round of quarterly company results that the euro zone debt crisis has triggered a marked slowdown in economic activity. On Tuesday, Europe's top engineering conglomerate Siemens posted a steep fall in core profit, while Swiss drugmaker Novartis said on Wednesday it was braced for lower profitability this year. Telecoms operators invested heavily through most of 2011 to upgrade networks to cope with surging data traffic from smartphones and tablets and some slowdown had been anticipated, particularly in the United States. But sales in Ericsson's key networks unit fell 9 percent year-on-year and profitability was half the level it was a year ago as operators economised and low margin business took a greater share of sales. ""If you look out in 2012 a little bit, you will probably see some more cautious operators,"" Ericsson chief executive Hans Vestberg said, adding margins would remain under pressure. But he also said the underlying drivers of growth remained. ""Consumers are calling equally as much ... they are using even more services on their iPads or their smartphones in the mobile networks...that has not changed,"" he said. At 1140 GMT, Ericsson shares were down 14.5 percent at 58.55 Swedish crowns, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock . Ericsson's results also pushed down shares in smaller rival Alcatel-Lucent around 10 percent while Germany's Siemens, owner of half of network firm Nokia Siemens Networks , was down nearly 5 percent. WINNING STRATEGY? Earnings before interest and tax, excluding Ericsson's loss-making joint ventures but including restructuring charges, were 4.1 billion Swedish crowns ($605 million), missing all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from 5.8 billion to 9.4 billion. Sales, at 63.7 billion crowns, were also well below the forecast of 67.2 billion, as was Ericsson's gross margin which came in at 30.2 percent against the projected 33.7 percent. The results follow a pattern set by some smaller equipment vendors, such as Juniper Networks Inc and Acme Packet Inc, which issued profit warnings in recent weeks, blaming slower spending at big U.S. carriers like Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T. In the short term, it is hard to see things improving. Ericsson said the impact of hardware heavy projects in Europe, which have low margins, would continue in the coming quarters. It also said that its very profitable CDMA business in the United States was starting to decline. Operators spending tends to follow economic output and much of the world is looking at slower growth in 2012 than last year. But longer-term, Ericsson remains the strongest player in the sector where rivals Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens Networks are fighting just to survive against tough competition from Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE. Should either Nokia Siemens Networks or Alcatel Lucent disappear from the market -- as many expect to happen in the next couple of years -- price pressure should ease. ""This industry is screaming for consolidation,"" said John Strand, founder of Danish telecoms consultancy Strand Consult. A bigger footprint in Europe should put Ericsson first in line for lucrative network upgrades in the coming years and some analysts see spending in the United States, where economic recovery is outpacing Europe, recovering in the near future. And with pressure on capacity from smartphone use and data traffic growing, operators can only put off spending, not avoid it for ever. ""We maintain a positive 12 months view on the name, but recognise the stock is likely to correct significantly today and in the next couple of month, most likely offering better entry points later this year,"" Pierre Ferragu, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said in a note. NokiaSiemens will report results on Thursday.

201201,Corning's Profit Falls 53% Amid LCD Price Slump,"Corning Inc. reported its fourth-quarter profit slumped 53% and said it plans to cut capacity in its liquid-crystal-display glass business, as weak demand is leading to ""significant"" price declines. Lackluster television demand has hurt electronics retailers, set manufacturers and suppliers like Corning, the world's largest maker of LCD glass for TVs. Struggling panel makers with excess supply have been able to negotiate steep price declines. Corning is hoping it can restore balance by cutting output, but the company acknowledged the environment has hurt its performance. ""These price declines are a reality, and they've lowered the profitability of our key businesses,"" Corning Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws said in an interview. ""We have ways to stop the price declines, and it remains to be seen if those will work."" Mr. Flaws said price declines will be significant in the first quarter, and the company isn't expecting much change in the overall glass market until after the period. Equity earnings in the first quarter are expected to decline 5% to 20%, excluding special items, due to lower earnings at its ventures with Samsung Electronics Co. and Dow Chemical Co. Corning's capacity plan follows a disappointing year for the TV industry. Consumers were cool on higher-priced sets with added features and sales were driven instead by heavy discounting. In November, Corning slashed its fourth-quarter profit estimate and said a major panel maker backed out of part of a sales contract, the first time that had happened in its LCD business. Mr. Flaws said the company's display business, which accounts for more than a third of Corning's revenue and the vast bulk of its earnings, remains ""very profitable."" He argued Corning's other businesses—such as making fiber-optic cables and the scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass used in smartphone and tablet screens—are also growing quickly. Corning's full-year sales and gross margins were the company's highest ever. Corning posted a profit of $491 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included a $326 million credit. Excluding items such as restructuring and other impairments, per-share earnings fell to 33 cents from 46 cents. Revenue increased 6.9% to $1.89 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of 33 cents a share on revenue of $1.85 billion. Gross margin widened to 43.7% from 43.5%. Display technology sales jumped about 4% to $780 million. Mia Lamar and Lauren Pollock contributed to this article. Write to Matt Jarzemsky at matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201201,"Apple Shares Surge, and Investors Ponder What's Next","Apple Inc. briefly reclaimed the title of the world's most valuable company after reporting historic fourth-quarter results thanks to the surging popularity of its smartphone and tablet computer. However, even as investors digest Apple's impressive performance in the final quarter of 2011, the following questions are already being asked: What's next? How can Apple maintain this momentum? And what will the company do with its nearly $100 billion in cash? The company has its eye on televisions, and it is expected to release a new iPad this year, according to people familiar with the matter. But as is usually the case, Apple gave few clues Tuesday about its future plans and simply suggested that things were going in the right direction. ""Apple's momentum is incredibly strong, and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a statement. That momentum pushed the Cupertino, Calif., company past Exxon Mobil Corp. in market valuation Wednesday morning; however, positions reversed after a statement from Federal Reserve officials projected a longer-than-anticipated time frame for low interest rates. Investors cheered the news of continued cheap money and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average—of which Exxon is a member—to an intraday high. Meanwhile, the Fed's downbeat view on business spending took some air out of Apple's gains. Apple shares—up as much as 8% earlier—closed up 6.2% at $446.66, giving it a market value of $416.4 billion, according to FactSet Research, just below the $418.1 billion valuation on Exxon Mobil. The oil company's shares, down as much as 1.6% earlier, finished ahead four cents. Apple's shares could rise to nearly $700 over the next year, according to several analysts, as customers upgrade their devices to newer models and as Apple attracts new users. PiperJaffray analyst Gene Munster, who increased his price target by 10% to $670, estimates 94% of iPhone owners expect to re-buy an iPhone. ""Investors are missing the potential long-term upside of Apple's current market expansion and future upgrade cycles,"" he noted. As for the company's future plans, though, Apple offered few specifics. Regarding its $97.6 billion in cash, Apple said officials were discussing ways to use it, but that they didn't have anything to announce Tuesday. And while Apple noted the sale of more than 1.4 million Apple TV products in the fourth quarter, it reiterated that the TV business was just a ""hobby."" In addition, Apple declined to speculate on whether reports of a pending new iPad may damp sales of the current one, as happened to the iPhone in the quarter preceding the new smartphone in October. How Apple handles and builds on its success is a concern because of questions about the impact from the death of its founder and visionary, Steve Jobs, in October. ""The major risk in the Apple story is that the company may no longer be able to innovate at the same rapid pace or with the same disruption that characterized the era when Steve Jobs was at the helm,"" Needham analyst Charlie Wolf said. At least in the short term, business is strong, as Apple's guidance indicates. Usually a conservative company, Apple provided an outlook for the current quarter that already was better than analysts were expecting. Also easing concerns is Apple's cash hoard, which again caused analysts to speculate about share buybacks or a dividend. BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman noted that even if Apple instituted a 2% dividend—the average yield of companies in the S&P 500—it still would have a total cash balance of $165 billion to $170 billion at the end of its fiscal 2013. ""Importantly, we believe that by paying a dividend, Apple could open up the stock to a new class of shareholders,"" Mr. Bachman said. ""Net, we believe either a stock buyback or dividend would not impact Apple's cash balance, but would benefit the stock's multiple."" Even with Apple's stock soaring to all-time highs, analysts say it has room to grow. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the shares ""discount a significant deceleration in top-line growth"" that she believes is unjustified. Ms. Huberty noted that in addition to the company's near-term drivers of upside—iPhone shipments, a new MacBook Air and a new iPad—Apple also has some longer term drivers. Those include an iPhone that uses speedier 4G wireless networks; a larger tablet market; overseas expansion, particularly in China; and the potential for Apple to enter the TV market. While other consumer electronics companies are racing to catch up with Apple, ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall said there are only ""minimal real competitive threats"" to Apple's major product families this year. ""In our view, if something were to go wrong with the story, it would mostly likely result from idiosyncratic misexecution on the part of [Apple] or a material change in support from the global carrier community,"" Mr. Marshall said. But he said both are unlikely given Apple's historical track record and that the company should have ""smooth sailing"" over the next few quarters.

201201,Ericsson Profit Plunges,"STOCKHOLM—Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the world's largest network-equipment maker, Wednesday reported a steep fall in fourth-quarter net profit on a combination of more cautious spending from U.S. carriers, losses at its joint ventures and an unfavorable swing in its business mix. The company also cautioned that operators will likely continue to spend cautiously in the short term due to the ongoing macro economic and political uncertainty. Net profit plunged to 1.15 billion Swedish kronor ($170.2 million) from 4.32 billion kronor a year earlier on revenue up 1.4% to 63.67 billion kronor, far below analysts' expectations of 67.83 billion kronor. Sales at its networks unit, its largest, fell 8.5% to 33.3 billion kronor. By early afternoon, Ericsson's shares were down 14%, leading a broad sell off in technology and the broader stock markets after they were earlier buoyed by another set of stellar earnings from Apple Inc. ""[In the fourth quarter] we saw weaker development in Networks, as well as an expected gross margin impact from a changed business mix with more coverage projects, modernization projects in Europe, and a higher services share,"" said Chief Executive Hans Vestberg. Over the past year, the company has aggressively pursued market share, entering into low-margin network upgrade contracts that aren't profitable right now but Ericsson hopes will lead to more profitable business in future. Analysts saw few bright spots in the report. ""The big negative surprise is the weak performance for Ericsson's networks business unit, where sales have fallen brutally,"" chiefly as a result of weak sales in North America, said Alandsbanken analyst Lars Soderfjel. ""I've really tried to see some positives, and maybe one can find some comfort in the higher cashflow and increased dividend, but that isn't enough,"" he said. ""This was a huge miss for Ericsson. While the general trends causing the margin decline were known, no one thought the decline would be of this magnitude,"" said Cheavreux analyst Odon de Laporte. While Ericsson is benefiting from increased mobile data traffic—a result of booming sales of data-hungry smartphones—the fourth-quarter was dragged down by lower sales to the U.S. CDMA network, a radio communication standard common in the country, as carriers start shifting toward the next-generation long-term-evolution standard. Additionally, U.S. carriers AT&T Inc. and Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Mobile USA have been involved in protracted merger talks, which despite being unsuccessful have turned attention and available funds away from network expansion, upgrades and improvements. North American sales fell 21% in the fourth quarter. However, Ericsson said increased usage of mobile devices and data traffic means that there is a continued need for investments in mobile broadband infrastructure in the region. ""This shift in technology means that there is a period when sales will slow down, but over time investments in next-generation networks will become very important for us,"" Mr. Vestberg told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. The company's fourth-quarter profit was also hit by losses at its Sony Ericsson handset joint venture with Japan's Sony Corp. and at ST-Ericsson, its semiconductor joint venture with STMicroelectronics NV. Sony Ericsson's fourth-quarter loss cut Ericsson's operating profit by 1.1 billion kronor, while ST-Ericsson's result reduced it by a further 800 million kronor. The Swedish company's closely-watched gross margin fell to 30.2%, from 36.6% a year earlier, dragged down by a relatively large proportion of low-margin network upgrade contracts in Europe. Analysts had expected a gross margin at 34.7% during the quarter. Rival Nokia Siemens Networks is due to report earnings in conjunction with Nokia Corp.'s fourth-quarter results on Thursday.

201202,Q&A: A closer look at Google's effort to get to know you better with new privacy policy,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - If you're amazed -- and maybe even a little alarmed -- about how much Google seems to know about you, brace yourself. Beginning Thursday, Google will operate under a streamlined privacy policy that enables the Internet's most powerful company to dig even deeper into the lives of its more than 1 billion users. Google says the changes will make it easier for consumers to understand how it collects personal information, and allow the company to create more helpful and compelling services. Critics, including most of the country's state attorneys general and a top regulator in Europe, argue that Google is trampling on people's privacy rights in its relentless drive to sell more ads. Here's a look at some of the key issues to consider as Google tries to learn about you. Q: How will Google's privacy changes affect users? A: Google Inc. is combining more than 60 different privacy policies so it will be able to throw all the data it gathers about each of its logged-in users into personal dossiers. The information Google learns about you while you enter requests into its search engine can be culled to suggest videos to watch when you visit the company's YouTube site. Users who write a memo on Google's online word processing program, Docs, might be alerted to the misspelling of the name of a friend or co-worker a user has communicated with on Google's Gmail. The new policy pools information from all Google-operated services, empowering the company to connect the dots from one service to the next. Q: Why is Google making these changes? A: The company, based in Mountain View, Calif., says it is striving for a ""beautifully simple, intuitive user experience across Google."" What Google hasn't spent much time talking about is how being able to draw more revealing profiles about its users will help sell advertising -- the main source of its $38 billion in annual revenue. One reason Google has become such a big advertising network: Its search engine analyzes requests to figure out which people are more likely to be interested in marketing pitches about specific products and services. Targeting the ads to the right audience is crucial because in many cases, Google only gets paid when someone clicks on an ad link. And, of course, advertisers tend to spend more money if Google is bringing them more customers. Q: Is there a way to prevent Google from combining the personal data it collects from all its services? A: No, not if you're a registered user of Gmail, Google Plus, YouTube, or other Google products. But you can minimize the data Google gathers. For starters, make sure you aren't logged into one of Google's services when you're using Google's search engine, watching a YouTube video or perusing pictures on Picasa. You can get a broad overview of what Google knows about you at http://www.google.com/dashboard, where a Google account login is required. Google also offers the option to delete users' history of search activity. It's important to keep in mind that Google can still track you even when you're not logged in to one of its services. But the information isn't quite as revealing because Google doesn't track you by name, only through a numeric Internet address attached to your computer or an alphanumeric string attached to your Web browser. Q: Are all Google services covered by the privacy policy? A: No, a few products, such as Google's Chrome Web browser and mobile payment processor Wallet, will still be governed by separate privacy policies. Q: Is Google's new privacy policy legal? A: The company has no doubt about it. That's why it's repeatedly rebuffed pleas to delay the changes since announcing the planned revisions five weeks ago. But privacy activists and even some legal authorities have several concerns. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group, sued the FTC in a federal court in an effort to force the FTC to exercise its powers and block Google's privacy changes. A federal judge ruled the courts didn't have the authority to tell the FTC how to regulate Google. The FTC says it is always looking for evidence that one of its consent orders has been violated. Earlier this week, the French regulatory agency CNIL warned Google CEO Larry Page that the new policy appears to violate the European Union's strict data-protection rules. Last week, 36 attorneys general in the U.S. and its territories derided the new policy as an ""invasion of privacy"" in a letter to Page. One of the major gripes is that registered Google users aren't being given an option to consent to, or reject, the changes, given that they developed their dependence on the services under different rules. In particular, people who bought smartphones running on Google's Android software, and signed two-year contracts to use the devices, can't easily avoid the new privacy rules unless they buy a different handset and pay an early-termination penalty. Q: What regulatory power do government agencies have to change or amend the privacy changes? A: The U.S. Federal Trade Commission gained greater oversight over Google's handling of personal information as part of a settlement reached last year. Google submitted to the agreement after exposing its users email contacts when it launched a now-defunct social networking service called Buzz in 2010.

201202,TomTom Shares Sink As It Issues A Warning,"AMSTERDAM -- Navigation-equipment maker TomTom NV warned Tuesday that its revenue and earnings are likely to fall further this year amid shrinking consumer demand, helping drive a 15% drop in the Dutch company's share price. TomTom, which competes with Garmin Ltd., of the Cayman Islands, said its fourth-quarter revenue fell 31% to 357.4 million euros ($478.8 million), as growth in other businesses failed to offset a decline in sales of TomTom's personal navigation devices to consumers. Net profit, despite lower operational expenses, sank 77% to 12 million euros, which the company attributed mainly to a cut in spending on marketing. Amsterdam-based TomTom expects revenue in 2012 to fall about 14% to 1.1 billion euros, despite sales growth at the company's automotive, business and content-licensing units last year. Its consumer business, which accounts for more than 60% of group revenue, is expected to contract further after a 40% drop in the fourth quarter. The company said its earnings per share, adjusted for restructuring costs and one-time items, would fall to 35 European cents from 55 European cents in 2011. TomTom shares fell 15% to 3.75 euros in Amsterdam trading Tuesday. ""The visibility in our core [personal-navigation-device] markets is limited as there remains great uncertainty about the rate of decline of customer demand for the category in the year ahead,"" TomTom said in a written statement, adding that this is exacerbated by an uncertain macroeconomic climate in the company's main markets. TomTom has struggled to offset the decline in sales and prices of navigation devices as overall demand for personal navigation systems declines, partly due to competition from smartphones. The company has been trying to offset this trend by sharpening its focus on devices that can be built into cars by auto makers, as well as on content and fleet-management services. ""The results and guidance support its view that TomTom still has a long way to go in its transformation from a hardware company to a content and services company,"" said Peter Olofsen, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. He has a ""reduce"" rating on the stock. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,Thoughts About the Lytro and the Camera Industry,"In a previous post about the Lytro, a new camera that lets you focus a photo after you've taken it (see my review here), I looked at what this new camera technology meant for photojournalism. There's another issue that Lytro raises, which is how the camera industry works and what kind of role a start-up can play in it. Many people I've spoken to about Lytro ask the same question: ""Why did they decide to make this camera themselves? Why not just license or sell the technology to, say, Canon or Nikon?"" It's true, while new Internet and software start-ups appear almost on the half-hour, hardware companies are often more established. Why not go to a company with manufacturing expertise, and marketing and sales channels, to lessen the risk of a new product? I think I know why Lytro went alone on this. For starters, if you were to show this technology to a traditional camera maker, I'm not sure it would rush to embrace it. Think about the staff, money and time a traditional camera manufacturer has sunk into its existing products and technologies: auto-focus systems, interchangeable lenses, things like that. The Lytro makes much of those efforts irrelevant. It challenges a structure that has taken years and billions of dollars to build. There are more than a few stories about the dysfunction that can affect large tech companies and their rival factions of engineers (cough-Sony-cough). How do you think the staff of a Canon would react to something that could upend their whole operation? The camera industry has been remarkably hidebound over the past few years. As I mentioned in my review and have written about before, the biggest change in photography lately has not been some new megapixel count or zoom level, it's been cameras' migration into smartphones and the sharing of pictures that has followed. Think about how many cameras let you do that straight from the device. Hard to think of any, right? Cameraphones have been around for about 15 years in one form or another. Surely that's been enough time to get a 3G chip in a camera, no? So it would never have been in Lytro's best interest to sell or license its technology to a traditional camera maker. It would most likely kill the technology, or morph it into something complicated and lame. What Lytro has done with this new product is show light-field photography in its purest state, making it hard to dismiss or bowdlerize. Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it's awfully hard to get back in. Will people rush out and buy Lytros by the gross? I don't think so, given its price and the limits of dedicated point-and-shoots, but there's little going back once people see what a Lytro can do. Either the company will bravely soldier on, releasing updates and new models on its own, or we may at some point see this technology appear in other gadgets - ones not made by Lytro. Technologically, there's no reason light-field photography can't happen on a smartphone. And there's more than a couple of deep-pocketed tech companies within a few miles of Lytro's Mountain View headquarters that could very likely license the technology or buy the company for what is petty cash to them. This first version of the Lytro is just that: a first, a proof-of-concept. But the technology and the company have legs. * Point-and-Shoots Top Amazon Holiday Sales * Six Great Gifts For Photographers * Nikon Joins the Mirrorless Movement * A Technique for Photos Real and Surreal * Canon's New SLR Cribs Some Sweet Features The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120229e82t003xp ",NYT Blogs,29 February 2012,645 words,thought lytro camera industry,previous post lytro new camera let focus photo youve taken see review looked technology meant photojournalism there another issue lytro raise industry work kind role startup many people ive spoken lytro question decide license sell say canon nikon true internet software almost halfhour hardware company often established manufacturing expertise marketing sale channel lessen risk product know lytro went alone starter traditional maker im sure rush embrace staff money time sunk existing autofocus system interchangeable lens thing like lytro effort irrelevant challenge structure year billion dollar story dysfunction affect large tech rival faction engineer coughsonycough react something upend whole operation remarkably hidebound past mentioned written biggest change photography lately megapixel zoom migration smartphones sharing followed device hard right cameraphones around one thats enough g chip never lytros best interest likely kill morph something complicated lame lytro done lightfield purest making dismiss bowdlerize toothpaste tube awfully back buy lytros dont given price limit dedicated pointandshoots little going lytro either bravely soldier releasing update model may point gadget made lytro technologically reason lightfield cant happen smartphone couple deeppocketed within mile lytros mountain headquarters cash first version lytro proofofconcept leg pointandshoots top amazon holiday six photographer nikon join mirrorless technique real surreal slr crib sweet feature york document nytbetxp
201202,A Review of the Lytro Camera,"When cameras went from analog to digital, it was one of those once-in-a-generation shifts, like going from black-and-white film to Kodachrome. But whether you're using a 35-millimeter or a point-and-shoot, the steps you take to shoot a picture have remained the same: you focus on something, then push a button to record the image. But what if you could take a picture and refocus it after you had taken it? What if, just by clicking around a photo on your computer screen, you could choose which part of the image should be clear and which part should be blurry? You can with a new camera called Lytro, and it's astonishing. With a Lytro, you take a picture as you would with any camera, but the digital file it creates can be refocused after the fact. This is fairly mind-blowing. Imagine a wedding photo with the bride in the foreground and the wedding party in the background. Click on the bride, and she's in focus while the bridesmaids are blurry. Click on the groomsmen and the focus shifts to them. Do this over and over all around the frame - the picture readjusts on the fly, smoothly moving from one focal point to another. The effect makes photography almost like cinematography, revealing things vividly in the foreground and background. Refocusing a Lytro image, I felt like one of those C.I.A. agents in the movies who is looking at satellite images and asks some technician to ""enhance"" the picture until Carlos the Jackal comes into focus. The Lytro, which began shipping from lytro.com on Wednesday, can do this because its image sensor captures more data than your standard camera does. Not only does Lytro's sensor register the usual things - like how bright the incoming light was and what colors it contained - it also knows which direction the light came from. Armed with that information - known among scientists as light-field data - the Lytro's onboard software can create multiple focal points. A view of the Lytro's inner workings shows how this array of tiny lenses and microprocessors makes this happen. This all happens in a camera the size and shape of a stick of butter. It's an unconventional design, with a lens at one end and a small, iPod-Nano-size touch screen at the other. On the top of the camera is a recessed button for the shutter release and a strip of bumps you slide your finger across to control the 8X optical zoom. On the bottom is a USB port and the power button. It's a simple and elegant package, but the shape and feel take a little getting used to; you kind of feel like an ship captain of yore with a spotting scope. The Lytro weighs 7.6 ounces, a bit more than some point-and-shoots, but not so much that you would notice. There's no removable storage or battery: the camera comes with either eight gigabytes of memory (350 pictures, costing $399) or 16 gigabytes (750 pictures, costing $499). Since the Lytro captures light rays, not pixels, its sensor is rated at ""11 megarays"" (11 million rays) instead of pixels. Both models come with a lithium-ion battery that is good for up to 600 shots between charges, the camera's maker says. Like a point-and-shoot, turning on the Lytro is nearly instantaneous; the touch screen comes to life in about a second. That touch screen is one of the Lytro's weaker points; it's a little like that Woody Allen joke about the restaurant (""The food at this place is really terrible. And such small portions!""). After years of viewing large, crisp displays on smartphones and even point-and-shoots, the Lytro's 1.5-inch LCD screen seems too grainy and small to really get a sense of what you're shooting. The touch screen's interface is more successful. When shooting, swiping up reveals an onscreen panel with battery life and memory-capacity information. Swiping to the right takes you to previously shot images. You can also switch between ""everyday mode,"" where the refocus range is determined automatically, and ""creative mode,"" which gives the photographer control over the refocus range. You do have to pick something to be in focus - there's no ""all in focus"" feature, though Lytro says a software update will include it later this year. After a picture has been taken, you can play around with focal points on the camera's display, but the Lytro's small LCD doesn't make that a very pleasurable experience - it's better to do it on a computer. (Right now, that computer has to be a Mac, because the Lytro is not yet compatible with Windows-run machines; the company says it will have Windows software later this year.) Taking pictures with the Lytro reveals other benefits besides focusing after the fact. For starters, being able to refocus later means you don't have to focus now. Since the camera is pulling in multiple focal points all at once, the Lytro doesn't have the shutter lag point-and-shoots have. It's not SLR fast, but you can fire away with little delay. My own test measured the Lytro at one shot about every 1.3 seconds. You can upload photos to your computer via the included USB cable. Bear in mind that Lytro photos don't leap onto your computer, but rather take more than one minute per shot to be uploaded and processed into clickable, refocusable images. If you're uploading dozens of photos, go downstairs and make a sandwich, or maybe a cassoulet, while the camera does its thing. Lytro users also get a free online account to create galleries, share links with friends and post photos to Facebook, Twitter and Lytro's public page, which is like an in-house version of Flickr. If you've ever used any photo-sharing site before, you'll find that Lytro's version is simple and straightforward and you'll understand how it works in about two minutes. Lytro images are stored as light-field picture files. Anyone with whom you share an lfp file can view it or click around and refocus it, just as you did. It's like a video you post from YouTube - the recipient doesn't need any special software; it's viewable in a Web browser (as you can see here). Given that a Lytro picture is meant to be played around with, the format is not really intended for printed photos. You can generate a print, but it will be at a fairly low resolution, 1080 by 1080 pixels. That's good enough for a 3 by 5 or maybe a 5 by 7 print, but anything larger will look grainy. So the Lytro is an astonishing new technology, presented in a attractive design, with easy-to-use software. But that doesn't mean you should buy it. The Lytro has some drawbacks - and not inconsiderable ones. For starters, you can't share photos while on the go. If you were to tear a Lytro apart, you'd see a dormant Wi-Fi chip inside, so clearly there's going to be an evolution with some wireless capability. But for now, what happens on a Lytro stays on a Lytro, until you plug it into your computer. And while refocusing is its own interesting tool, that's the only tool you have at this point - adding a filter or importing the image into Photoshop remains impossible. Then there's the price. Four or five hundred dollars is not chump change, even for nonchumps. It's too expensive for basic photo purposes (that's what your phone's camera is for), and professional users will want more control over settings and lenses. The potential of light-field photography is great - that whole ""don't have to focus"" thing is maybe even more impressive than focusing after the fact - but there's a difference between a great technology and a great product. Should Lytro's engineers refine light-field photography into something more versatile and cheaper (imagine this on a smartphone), it may turn out to be a game changer. For now, I tip my hat to the innovators at Lytro, but I'm not opening my wallet. * Thoughts About the Lytro and Photojournalism * Additional Thoughts on the Death of the Point-and-Shoot * Thoughts About the Lytro and the Camera Industry * Q&A: Finding a Lost Camera's Owner * A Camera Phone, Sans Phone The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120229e82t0035x ",NYT Blogs,29 February 2012,1461 words,review lytro camera,camera went analog digital one onceinageneration shift like going blackandwhite film kodachrome whether youre using millimeter pointandshoot step remained focus something push record image refocus taken clicking around photo computer screen part clear blurry new called lytro astonishing lytro file creates refocused fact fairly mindblowing imagine wedding bride foreground party background shes bridesmaid groomsman frame readjusts fly smoothly moving focal point another effect photography almost cinematography revealing thing vividly refocusing lytro felt cia agent looking satellite asks technician enhance carlos jackal come lytro began shipping lytrocom wednesday sensor capture data standard lytros usual bright incoming color contained also know came armed known among scientist lightfield lytros onboard software multiple view lytros inner working array tiny lens microprocessor happen happens size stick butter unconventional design end small ipodnanosize touch recessed shutter strip slide across x optical zoom bottom usb port power simple elegant getting used kind captain yore spotting lytro weighs ounce bit pointandshoots much notice there removable storage battery either eight gigabyte costing since lytro ray pixel rated megarays million instead model lithiumion good shot maker say pointandshoot turning lytro instantaneous life lytros weaker woody allen joke restaurant food really terrible year viewing large crisp display smartphones even pointandshoots lytros inch lcd seems grainy youre successful swiping reveals onscreen panel memorycapacity swiping previously everyday mode determined automatically creative give photographer pick something feature though lytro update include later lytros lcd doesnt pleasurable better mac lytro compatible windowsrun machine window taking lytro reveals benefit starter able mean dont since pulling lytro doesnt lag pointandshoots slr fast fire away delay measured lytro every upload via included usb cable mind lytro dont leap onto per uploaded processed clickable refocusable youre uploading dozen downstairs sandwich maybe cassoulet lytro user free online account gallery link friend post facebook twitter lytros public page inhouse version flickr youve ever photosharing site youll lytros straightforward youll understand two lytro stored lightfield anyone lfp video youtube recipient doesnt special viewable web browser given lytro meant played format intended printed resolution thats enough anything larger lytro technology presented attractive easytouse doesnt buy lytro drawback inconsiderable cant lytro apart youd dormant wifi evolution wireless capability happens lytro lytro plug interesting tool thats adding filter importing photoshop remains impossible price four five hundred dollar chump nonchumps expensive basic thats professional want potential lightfield whole dont impressive difference product lytros engineer refine lightfield something versatile cheaper smartphone may game changer hat innovator lytro im opening wallet lytro photojournalism additional pointandshoot lytro industry qa finding lost owner sans york time document nytbetx
201202,FEATURE-The battle's on for control of the video dial tone,"NEW YORK, Feb 29 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's attempt to convince a European court to impose tougher conditions on Microsoft Corp's acquisition of Skype signals that technology companies are gearing up to battle for control of what some say is the next big thing: videoconferencing. As the networking giant scrambles to safeguard its market leadership and ownership of a technology that is crossing over from business into the consumer world, rival players like Polycom Inc and Citrix Systems Inc are devising their own user-friendly solutions. All will contend with Microsoft, which analysts say plans to integrate Skype into its products, potentially boosting the allure of its software and a future crop of Windows devices. The teleconferencing market is small, but its growing popularity among consumers and its widening use in mobile phones make this struggle -- waged through courts, mergers and regulators -- a crucial one. ""Video is the new world ..., and you will see lots of acquisitions, lots of lawsuits, and those who are behind will use patent litigation,"" said Krish Ramakrishnan, chief executive officer of videoconferencing service Blue Jeans Network. Research firm Infonetics forecast that video would be the top trend in telecoms. The global enterprise videoconferencing market will hit $5 billion in 2015 compared with $2.2 billion in 2010. Videoconferencing is on the brink of widespread adoption. New services and software are enabling a high-speed Internet connection and standard desktop computer, smartphone or tablet to provide quality similar to the expensive systems that were once confined to corporate boardrooms. In fact, free chat services such as Apple Inc's FaceTime, Skype and Google+ are slowly making video a part of everyday life for many users outside of the workplace. But one thing holding back its growth is that the technology is often proprietary. That makes many services incompatible with each other, so callers on Skype cannot hook up with people using Polycom, the No. 2 videoconferencing player, for example. Text messaging did not become ubiquitous -- and create dependable revenue streams for operators -- in the United States until the middle of the last decade, after mobile providers agreed to work together and allow people to send messages regardless of their carrier. On the surface, that's Cisco's main gripe with the Microsoft-Skype deal, which closed in October. Cisco argues that the deal will impede interoperability and that Microsoft will be able to lock in businesses that want to reach Skype's 700 million account holders if it integrates the acquired technology exclusively into its Lync Communications Platform. Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers said that when the company acquired Norway's Tandberg in 2009, the EU approved the deal under the condition it stick to open standards. Now it wants to ensure Microsoft does the same. A FIG LEAF Most analysts and industry experts say Cisco fears it could lose its dominant position if Microsoft does a good job of absorbing Skype, which already allows a combination of business and consumer usage. Many companies, including computer consultancy Capgemini, already use Skype as an unofficial video tool, and millions of consumers worldwide take advantage of it. But industry observers also argue that given Microsoft's less-than-stellar track record on innovation, Cisco can afford to sit back and relax. ""I am surprised they are still pursuing regulatory relief and using interoperability as a fig leaf for it,"" Ovum analyst Ian Jacobs said. ""Cisco needs to let Microsoft do what it does best and stifle innovation of its own products."" Ex-Microsoft President Dick Brass once described how the company had developed a tablet PC as early as 2001, but it was doomed because of internal opposition. ""Buying Skype was one of Microsoft's most brilliant moves in a long time,"" said Joseph Coyle, Capgemini's North American head of technology. ""They'll pose a big challenge to Cisco unless they stumble."" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said at the Goldman Sachs technology conference earlier this month that the company's Lync platform appealed to enterprise, or business, customers, but can't be used with someone outside a company's firewall or with an incompatible system. Enter Skype. Klein said the company had been looking at ways to extend Skype through all of its offerings, from Lync to its Xbox videogame console. Whether Microsoft will prevail remains to be seen, but if industry experts are correct, videoconferencing companies will make more moves to elbow competitors out of the way. ""Everyone is trying to create an island...and this (Cisco appeal) is more about slowing down the inevitable,"" Ramakrishnan said, adding it was only a matter of time until the intersection between enterprise and consumer video forced vendors to work together. Microsoft itself recently filed a complaint with the European Commission against Motorola Mobility, which it said was trying to block its products that play video and connect wirelessly by charging too much for patents. Ovum's Jacobs predicted more legal wrangles. ""If the slow-moving service providers and technology companies cannot keep up with where the world will be in a year,"" Jacobs said, ""they will try to hold the world back so it will be where they are in a year."" But such ""legal wrangling"" will leave room for smaller companies offering videoconferencing for businesses, he added. Jacobs said he also expected some acquisitions as rivals jostle to fill niche areas in their video portfolios. MOVE OVER, WEBEX Cisco has a vested interest in keeping rivals at bay. Its Tandberg purchase, which filled a crucial gap between its high-end TelePresence conferencing products and WebEx desktop video service, made the company the dominant player in the market. And it has the added benefit that video requires ample bandwidth as well as advanced network equipment, resulting in sales of routers and switches -- the keys to managing Internet traffic and also Cisco's bread and butter business. Now, Cisco is keen to find new networking functions and is betting heavily on video, which CEO Chambers predicted ""will not only be the leading way we communicate, it'll be the primary form of IT."" However, Cisco likes to be the one-stop shop for all of its customers' needs, and it repeatedly touts the benefits of a single vendor strategy. It remains to be seen how Cisco will grapple with the new technologies and slew of rivals gearing up to take their slice of the video communications pie. It is still strong in the enterprise segment, but times are changing, analysts say. ""We've been long-time WebEx users,"" said Donald Tom, associate vice president of IT services at TCS Education System. But he noted that its three affiliated colleges and graduate schools recently switched to Citrix's GoToMeeting HD Faces for video communications among their more than 5,000 students. ""We found it easy to use,"" he said. ""The video is rock-solid. It really can change how we teach and learn."" Capgemini's Coyle said the company had once had a lot of Cisco gear. ""But we're backing off,"" he said. ""Their biggest challenge will be around price point."" COEXISTENCE Bernardo de Albergaria, who heads Citrix's online collaboration business, said users were looking for simpler solutions because the high cost of infrastructure and maintaining it. ""Bring a laptop and a webcam, and you're set,"" he said. ""Why do I need to buy a very complex solution now that there's easy-to-use other stuff?"" Others like Polycom choose to make their technology compatible with those of their competitors. Jim Kruger, Polycom's senior vice president of solution marketing, described Cisco as ""one vendor trying to [20120229 203204 GMT] do all, rip and replace everything and then take Cisco."" But like Cisco, Polycom is under pressure from companies such as Citrix and Vidyo, whose videoconferencing systems run on virtual servers, making dedicated gear and services unnecessary. In addition, young people moving into the workplace expect to bring their own mobile devices and have them work smoothly, with instant video and data access. ""It is simply a matter of what the coexistence of multiple systems will look like, and who will dictate the terms of that coexistence,"" Ovum's Jacobs said. Cisco will fight hard to make sure it dictates those terms. ""They have added a lot of management muscle (to video),"" Mizuho Securities analyst Joanna Makris said. ""They definitely do not want to lose this case.""

201202,INTERVIEW-HTC says to sell more smartphones in 2012,"BARCELONA, Feb 29 (Reuters) - Taiwanese group HTC is confident new models coming to market in April will turn around the ailing fortunes of the world's No.5 smartphone maker, and help to boost its annual sales volumes above last year's level. ""We are confident this year will be ... a much better year,"" Florian Seiche, chief of HTC's European operations said, referring to the number of smartphones sold. ""Even with the Q1 not being the ideal fast start right out of the gate in January, which of course we would have preferred, even with that we are very confident,"" Seiche told Reuters in an interview on sidelines of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The Taiwanese smartphone maker launched the HTC One series of models at the trade show, taking the fight to Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc with fast graphic chips and advanced music and photography functions. It is a fight that HTC was losing at the end of last year, when its sales slumped and investors dumped shares on concerns the firm had lost its edge.

201202,UPDATE 2-Ziggo IPO could kick start Europe's new listing market,"* Offering could raise 600 mln to 800 mln euros - IFR * Price range due around March 9 - sources * Could be first major European IPO since mid-2011 (Adds detail, background) By Roberta Cowan and Kylie MacLellan AMSTERDAM/LONDON, Feb 29 (Reuters) - Dutch cable firm Ziggo launched an initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesda, which could raise up to 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for its founding shareholders and help kick start Europe's dormant new listings market. Ziggo's IPO will be made up solely of existing shares held by its founding shareholders, which include affiliates of private equity firms Cinven and Warburg Pincus , the company said in a statement. Europe has seen no sizeable IPOs since the middle of last year as companies put their listing plans on ice during a period of market volatility brought on by the euro zone debt crisis. More buoyant stock markets -- the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares has risen around 7 percent since the start of the year -- have allowed several listed companies to test investor appetite with share sales, either raising new money or allowing major shareholders to cut their stakes. Ziggo, whose shares will be floated in Amsterdam, is one of the two main cable operators in the Netherlands providing TV and internet services to about half of all Dutch households. The other is UPC, owned by Liberty Global -- previously touted as a potential buyer of Ziggo. ""It is stable, cash generative and defensive, yet has a good growth profile. I think it is the ideal sort of IPO to reopen the European IPO market,"" said one source close to the deal. ""If it gets going then people will start getting more excited about IPOs, so it is important transaction from that perspective."" BOOSTING SENTIMENT Ziggo is the second major IPO to kick off this month, after Swiss-based DKSH, which helps companies market and distribute their goods in Asia, began marketing a planned listing last week. The Dutch firm, a more well-known name considered by some working in the market to have a better chance of boosting sentiment if successful, is running its offering on a slightly accelerated basis to help reduce market exposure, so could pip DKSH to the post in completing first. European IPOs usually take around a month from launch to completion. Instead, Ziggo will spend around 10 days marketing the offering, two sources close to the deal said, with a price range expected on March 9 when a management roadshows kick off. It will then spend a further 10 days bookbuilding, with a final price due to be set around March 20. Trading is expected to begin on March 21, one of the sources said. Cinven and Warburg Pincus, who delayed plans to list Ziggo last year due to choppy financial markets, are aiming to raise between 600 million euros and to 800 million from the sale, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported on Tuesday. The company is aiming for a free float of around 17.5 percent, one of the sources close to the deal said. Ziggo said it would give further details on the timeframe and size of the offering when it releases its prospectus. The Dutch cable firm reported 1.48 billion euros in revenue and 835 million euros in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2011. It said it intended to drive growth through a ""TV Everywhere"" strategy offering services across TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones and continued growth in the provision of broadband internet and telephony services to business customers. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are the joint global coordinators for the offering, and joint bookrunners along with Deutsche Bank and UBS. ABN AMRO, HSBC, Nomura and Rabobank are acting as joint lead managers and ABN AMRO and Rabobank are the joint retail bookrunners. Societe Generale is co-lead manager, Ziggo said.

201202,RPT-PREVIEW-Microsoft unveils Windows 8 for public test,"(Repeats to widen readership) * Public test of new system available Wednesday * To be compatible with ARM chips for tablets, cellphones * Challenge for Microsoft is to attract apps developers * Analysts expect sales bump but dipping margins * Shares hit four-year high at $31.85 By Bill Rigby SEATTLE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp unveils the first widely available test version of Windows 8 on Wednesday, giving the public the first chance to try out the slick, new-look operating system it hopes will restore the company's fading tech supremacy. Windows 8, as the first Microsoft operating system compatible with low-power microprocessors designed by ARM Holdings Plc, will run on tablets as well as desktops and laptops. ""The operating system has begun to be seen as largely irrelevant,"" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen, which holds Microsoft shares. ""This is the release that will have to prove its relevance all over again."" Tablets and smartphones and cloud computing have made Bill Gates' vision of ""a computer on every desk and in every home"" seem quaint, and Apple Inc and Google Inc and Amazon.com now set the agenda for the computing industry. Still, all of those companies' fancy new hardware devices need basic operating software, and Microsoft is betting there is still more than a little room for Windows. ""The big increment here is that it'll be viable on the ARM platform, that there'll be a tablet form factor -- that kind of makes it a big deal,"" said Dan Hanson, a portfolio manager at BlackRock, which holds 5 percent of Microsoft's shares through various funds. ""Microsoft correctly identified the relevance of the tablet form factor over a decade ago. This operating system may allow them to finally execute."" THE PRODUCT Windows 8 will come in two main flavors -- one that works on the traditional x86 chips made by Intel Corp for desktops and laptops, and a new version for the ARM microprocessors that have become the standard for tablets, smartphones and other portable devices. Microsoft says it is aiming to get machines running on both the ARM and Intel platforms into the market at the same time but has not set a target date. In both versions, Windows 8 features a completely new interface, borrowed from what Microsoft calls the ""Metro"" style of the current Windows Phone software. It features blocks or 'tiles' that can be moved around the screen or tapped to go straight into an application. The tiles update in real time, so you can see if you have emails, voice messages or Facebook notifications at a glance. If PC and laptop users do not like the new format, they can revert to the old style with a click of the mouse. The key for any operating software -- be it Apple's iOS for iPhones and iPads, Google's Android software for smartphones, or Windows -- is to attract the support of the software developers who build applications, and on that score Windows 8 is off to a decent start. ""The biggest hurdle our designers have had is trying to get inside the mood of a Metro user, where less is more,"" said Paul Murphy, business development manager at Aviary, which makes a photo editing tool that can be integrated into iOS and Android apps. ""That was and still is a challenge, but I think now that they've been at it for a couple of months, they actually really like it. They appreciate the simplicity of the design."" Developers who have already created apps for Microsoft's Windows Phone are finding it easier to adapt to Windows 8, said Ryan Lowdermilk, who hosts a popular podcast for apps builders. ""Porting your code over, people are finding that to be pretty straightforward. But as far as finishing that last mile where some of this newer technology for Windows 8 comes into play, they are finding little hiccups and bugs here and there."" WINDOWS + OFFICE = $ The Windows 8 release has to be good, and soon, say industry experts. ""Now that the tablet market is being defined by the iPad and the (Amazon) Kindle, if they come out with a buggy first version, they won't get a second chance,"" said Michael Cherry, a former Microsoft engineer who now works at independent research firm Directions on Microsoft. ""They can't afford to disappoint customers."" Microsoft has not put a timetable on the final release, but Windows unit head Steven Sinofsky has said new versions of Windows should be no more than three years apart, which would put a Windows 8 debut around October 2012. The public will get its first good look at Windows 8 on Wednesday, when Sinofsky launches the ""Consumer Preview"" at an event in Barcelona. Everybody will be able to download a test version of Windows 8 that will run on PCs and laptops based on Intel chips. But they won't get to try out Windows 8 on an ARM tablet until later this year. Initial buyers for Windows tablets are expected to be consumers, as most business users have not yet even moved onto Windows 7. But the long-term success of Windows 8 will depend on Microsoft's core business customers. A Windows tablet that works seamlessly with Microsoft's Exchange email system and Office applications would be a godsend for corporate technology managers, who have been bending over backward to put their CEO's iPads -- ""executive jewelry,"" as one analyst puts it -- onto their company's email and security systems. Microsoft's killer punch is Office. After months of silence, Sinofsky confirmed earlier this month that the world's most popular suite of work applications, including the newest versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, will come installed on tablets running the ARM version of Windows. That's a big and potentially risky departure for Microsoft, which has in the past sold Office separately. They will not be in the new ""Metro"" style, but they will be optimized for touch. That would give Windows tablets a unique selling point over iPads and Android tablets. HIGH STAKES Even a wildly successful Windows 8 might be less profitable for Microsoft than its predecessors, simply because the company won't be able to charge nearly as much for software that runs a $400 tablet than it could for software running a $1,500 PC. The Windows unit averages about $80 per PC sold now, but will likely get half that from tablets, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts estimate. Wall Street is expecting a bump in Windows sales for at least 12 months after the release, fueled by consumer demand for tablets but does not foresee a spike matching the hot-selling Windows 7. Analysts are estimating a 12 percent jump in Microsoft's earnings per share for each of the next two fiscal years, which is better than the flat expectations for this year, marred by lackluster PC sales. But it is not exceptional for a company that posted nearly 30 percent increases in earnings per share for the last two fiscal years. Gross profit margins, while still comparatively high, are expected to drift slightly lower. Several analysts have recently raised their outlook for next year's earnings, helping the stock rise to a four-year high on Tuesday, partly buoyed by building interest in Windows 8. ""The next four to six quarters will be extremely important for Microsoft,"" said Parakh at McAdams Wright Ragen. ""They have to prove they too have a competitive product, not just on traditional desktop PCs and laptops but on the tablet and even phones. And this is their chance.""

201202,Digits / Updates from the Mobile World Congress,"Google's Rubin: Android Is Not Playing Favorites The man in charge of Google Inc.'s Android mobile operating system said the company ""built a firewall"" to keep his Android team at a safe distance away from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., the handset maker that Google last year agreed to acquire for $12.5 billion. Speaking at a press conference here, Andy Rubin said he was ""painfully aware"" of the questions surrounding whether Google might favor Motorola by giving it early releases of Android software ahead of other manufacturers such as HTC Corp., or otherwise will help Motorola to build the best Android-powered devices on the market. Mr. Rubin said it would be ""completely insane"" to try to turn Motorola, which currently has ""single-digit"" market share in Android handsets, into the dominant player. ""It just isn't going to happen,"" he said, adding that ""the way Android's going to continue to be successful is to be neutral."" -- Amir Efrati Ericsson Emphasizes Software Business Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, traditionally seen as a maker of hardware for telephone networks, is shifting its focus to software as the technology evolves and as it grapples with pricing pressure from Chinese handset rivals. Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said software now makes up well over half of its business. ""We're often described as a manufacturer of equipment, but if you look at the size of our software and services businesses last year, it made up over 60% [of revenue],"" Mr. Vestberg said. Ericsson's market share for mobile network infrastructure hit 38% in the final three months of 2011, the company's chief executive said. -- Sven Grundberg Huawei Aims to Triple Smartphone Sales in 2012 Huawei Technologies Co., China's biggest maker of phone equipment, aims to nearly triple its smartphone sales in 2012, the chief executive of its devices unit said, after launching what it called the world's fastest phone. Huawei aims to sell between 50 million and 60 million smartphones this year, up from 20 million in 2011, Wan Biao said on the sidelines of the conference. It hopes to achieve this partly by more than doubling its spending on marketing, to between 4% and 5% of sales, compared with 2% in 2011. Huawei presented the Ascend D Quad smartphone at this year's conference. The device is equipped with a quad-core processor that the company makes itself, making it twice as powerful as most smartphones, which run on duo-core processors. The phone's retail price hasn't yet been announced, but Wan said it will likely be between 400 euros ($536) and 500 euros. -- Archibald Preuschat Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,AT&T May Try Billing App Makers,"BARCELONA -- AT&T Inc. said it is considering a way to let the providers of mobile services pay for the cost of the data traffic associated with things like streaming movies and smartphone applications, opening up a new round of debate over the rules of the mobile Internet. John Donovan, the executive responsible for AT&T's network and technology, explained the carrier's interest in the service in an interview, likening it to toll-free calling for the mobile-broadband world. ""A feature that we're hoping to have out sometime next year is the equivalent of 800 numbers that would say, if you take this app, this app will come without any network usage,"" Mr. Donovan said on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress, a mobile-industry conference, here. Carriers have been considering different pricing models for years as they look for ways to make more money from skyrocketing mobile-data use. But AT&T's approach would be novel, an attempt to push some of the cost of data traffic back onto the Internet companies and other service providers that profit from it. It is far from clear how willing technology companies would be to pay wireless carriers for data use. Mr. Donovan said there was interest from companies that could use the feature to drum up new business from customers wary of using data-heavy services like mobile video. ""What they're saying is, why don't we go create new revenue streams that don't exist today and find a way to split them,"" Mr. Donovan said of the technology companies. The incentive -- or cudgel -- for technology companies to participate comes from AT&T and Verizon Wireless's shift from unlimited data plans to ones that charge users higher monthly fees as their data consumption goes up. A customer nearing his data limit for the month could be more likely to download a movie if the content provider covered the price of the data transmission. Some consumer advocates reacted with dismay, arguing that AT&T could stifle competition and shift the playing field toward well-heeled app developers and content providers that have the financial capacity to subsidize mobile customers' data use. ""You have to raise all this additional capital to reach the customer or alternatively you have to compete with well-established players who can afford to pay,"" said Harold Feld, legal director for consumer group Public Knowledge. By allowing some companies to pay for better services for wireless customers, AT&T could be wading back into the ""net neutrality"" debate that played out in recent years. Proponents of net neutrality say that telecommunications companies shouldn't be allowed to give special treatment to some service providers, because doing so would threaten the ideal of the ""open Web,"" where easy access to customers lets new competitors like Facebook Inc. spring up quickly. Telecom companies say they need to have the flexibility to manage traffic on their networks. The Federal Communications Commission has adopted ""net neutrality"" rules that are stricter for landline networks than mobile ones, and Public Knowledge said it would be tough to challenge AT&T's plan under the FCC's rules. Mr. Donovan, in the interview on Monday, said AT&T needed to find creative ways to deal with and profit from surging mobile-data use. The FCC declined to comment. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,"Intel, Micron Expand Joint Venture","Intel Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. have agreed to expand a joint venture involving flash-memory chips to improve the relationship's efficiency and flexibility. Under the agreements, Micron will supply NAND products to Intel, while Intel will sell its stake in two wafer factories for approximately $600 million. Intel will receive half of the sale's consideration in cash while the remaining amount will be deposited with Micron and may be refunded or applied to Intel's future purchases under the supply agreement. The agreements also expand the companies' NAND Flash joint development program to include emerging memory technologies. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of the year. The two chip makers have partnered for several years to make NAND flash, the memory commonly used in smartphones and tablets. Through joint ventures, Intel and Micron share part of the capital expenditure and research and development burdens, while also being able to buy NAND products at manufacturing cost. In April, the chipmakers introduced a new 20 nanometer NAND flash manufacturing process, ramping up competition in the quick-growing memory market and allowing device makers to include more memory in their products.

201202,TomTom Warns of Rough Road,"AMSTERDAM—Navigation-equipment maker TomTom NV warned Tuesday that its revenue and earnings are likely to fall further this year amid shrinking consumer demand, helping drive a 15% drop in the Dutch company's share price. TomTom, which competes with Garmin Ltd., of the Cayman Islands, said its fourth-quarter revenue fell 31% to €357.4 million ($478.8 million), as growth in other businesses failed to offset a decline in sales of TomTom's personal navigation devices to consumers. Net profit, despite lower operational expenses, sank 77% to €12 million, which the company attributed mainly to a cut in spending on marketing. Amsterdam-based TomTom expects revenue in 2012 to fall about 14% to €1.1 billion, despite sales growth at the company's automotive, business and content-licensing units last year. Its consumer business, which accounts for more than 60% of group revenue, is expected to contract further after a 40% drop in the fourth quarter. The company said its earnings per share, adjusted for restructuring costs and one-time items, would fall to 35 European cents from 55 European cents in 2011. TomTom shares fell 15% to €3.75 in Amsterdam trading Tuesday. ""The visibility in our core [personal-navigation-device] markets is limited as there remains great uncertainty about the rate of decline of customer demand for the category in the year ahead,"" TomTom said in a written statement, adding that this is exacerbated by an uncertain macroeconomic climate in the company's main markets. TomTom has struggled to offset the decline in sales and prices of navigation devices as overall demand for personal navigation systems declines, partly due to competition from smartphones. The company has been trying to offset this trend by sharpening its focus on devices that can be built into cars by auto makers, as well as on content and fleet-management services. ""The results and guidance support its view that TomTom still has a long way to go in its transformation from a hardware company to a content and services company,"" said Peter Olofsen, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. He has a ""reduce"" rating on the stock. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,Prices of Chips and Chip Makers Rise,"TOKYO—Prices of memory chips used in personal computers rose sharply Tuesday on expectations that the failure of Japanese chip maker Elpida Memory Inc. will tighten global supply in the short term. Share prices of Elpida rivals Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix Semiconductor Inc., of South Korea, and Micron Technology Inc. of the U.S. were also higher after Elpida announced late Monday it filed for bankruptcy protection with debt exceeding $5.5 billion. Elpida is Japan's last remaining maker of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips. For years, makers have struggled to make money in a thin-margin market plagued by overcapacity. Although the rise of smartphones and tablet computers has created new demand for high-end mobile DRAM chips, sharp declines in the price of chips used in traditional PCs—the biggest consumers of DRAM chips—have severely hurt the earnings of most DRAM makers. Elpida has posted net losses for five consecutive quarters. ""The immediate effect of Elpida's bankruptcy filing will likely be a sentimental increase in DRAM prices as worries of capacity coming offline would implicate a shift in supply versus demand,"" Barclays Capital said in a report Tuesday. Spot prices of DRAM chips surged Tuesday, with double data rate three chips—the mainstream in the industry—up as much as 13%, according to DRAMeXchange, an online chip clearinghouse in Taiwan. Elpida's demise may continue to lend support to chip prices, as will likely give DRAM makers more bargaining power with major clients buying on contract, said Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Yuichi Ishida. As of last September, Elpida and Micron were tied for third in the global DRAM market share, with 12.1% of the market, well behind Samsung's 45% and Hynix's 21.5%, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. ""Korean DRAM makers should gain additional market share and benefit from less fierce competition, allowing them to better cope with the volatile industry cycle over the medium-to-long term,"" said Alvin Lim, associate director at Fitch Ratings. He added that a sale of Elpida's chip plants is likely, "" although operations should continue in some form."" Elpida said Monday that it is seeking a sponsor as part of its rehabilitation process under the Japanese court. A Samsung spokesman said Tuesday that the company is not interested in Elpida, suggesting that it has no intention of backing up its rival. ""We are also not considering a partnership with the company,"" the spokesman said. Elpida's shares, which will be delisted March 28, didn't trade Tuesday due to sell orders' vastly outweighing buy orders; they ended the session ask-only at the lowest daily limit of ¥254 ($3.15). In South Korea, Samsung shares ended up 1.2% at 1,185,000 won ($1,053) and Hynix surged 6.8% to 29,850 won, while the benchmark Kospi index closed up 0.6%. Micron closed Monday up 7.7% on the Nasdaq Stock Market shares ended up 1.2% at 1,185,000 won ($1,053) and Hynix surged 6.8% to 29,850 won, while the benchmark Kospi index closed up 0.6%. Micron closed Monday up 7.7% on the DRAM makers in Taiwan, where the stock market was closed for a holiday Tuesday, include Nanya Technology Corp. and Powerchip Technology Corp., which has a joint venture with Elpida called Rexchip Electronics Corp. Japanese government bonds rose Tuesday as Elpida's failure soured investor appetite for risky assets and prompted brief bouts of flight-to-quality bond buying. ""The Elpida collapse upset a few people—some of the Japanese megabanks had midsize loans to them,"" one banker said. ""There was some initial liquidation of JGBs to compensate for losses on Elpida bonds, but they've since rebounded."" Japan Credit Rating Agency had a BBB- rating on Elpida's debt before the bankruptcy filing, upon which it was downgraded to the lowest rating—D, for default. ""It was a surprise as the bonds were traded at 98% their face value on Monday morning,"" said Akane Enatsu, a senior credit analyst at Barclays Capital. On Tuesday, the defaulted bonds were not being traded, with no bids or offers in the market, traders said. Investors will be focused on the collection rate for Elpida bonds. Deutsche Securities credit analyst Akihito Murata expects a range of 10% to 20% of face value, adding that predicting a precise figure is difficult at this point due a lack of clarity over a number of outstanding issues such as how much financial aid will be provided by a possible sponsor.

201202,Nokia's New Phones Fail to Connect,"It was no ringing endorsement for Nokia. The Finnish mobile giant opened an industry trade show in Barcelona with the launch of six new phones—and saw its share price fall roughly 1% for each. While Nokia is delivering on its strategy to target both high-end customers and those in emerging markets getting online for the first time, it is being squeezed at both ends. There was much to admire in Nokia's new product range. The PureView 808 features a 41-megapixel camera, promising the best-ever image and video quality seen on a mobile phone. The Lumia 610 is Nokia's first midrange smartphone running Windows, which will be priced at €189 ($254) to appeal to cost-conscious European and U.S. customers. And the launch of two lower-priced Asha feature phones—halfway between mobile phones and smartphones—should play to Nokia's historic strengths in emerging markets. But that is only half of the story. The PureView runs on Nokia's soon-to-be-discontinued Symbian operating system; adapting the graphics technology for use on a Windows Phone will take time. The Lumia phones will compete head-to-head with now ubiquitous Android-based phones. And Nokia's Asha range is aimed midway between a feature phone market estimated to contract by about 8% this year and a market for low-end smartphones that faces tough price competition from local vendors in places like China. Meanwhile, winning over customers to Windows Phones will be a challenge. The smartphone market is becoming more concentrated. Apple, Samsung and HTC made 99% of the sector's operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2011, estimates Sanford Bernstein. Sales of new Windows Phones made up less than 2% of U.S. smartphone sales in the quarter; its ""marketplace"" offers just 65,000 apps, versus more than 400,000 for the iPhone. Average selling prices for Nokia's phones fell 23% in the fourth quarter from the previous year. Heavy spending on marketing and retail staff training could put a further dent in margins, which Nokia has already warned may turn negative this quarter. The shares trade at 14 times 2013 consensus forecast earnings, according to FactSet—that may be calling too much of a recovery.

201202,AT&T May Try Billing App Makers,"BARCELONA—AT&T Inc. said it is considering a way to let the providers of mobile services pay for the cost of the data traffic associated with things like streaming movies and smartphone applications, opening up a new round of debate over the rules of the mobile Internet. John Donovan, the executive responsible for AT&T's network and technology, explained the carrier's interest in the service in an interview, likening it to toll-free calling for the mobile-broadband world. ""A feature that we're hoping to have out sometime next year is the equivalent of 800 numbers that would say, if you take this app, this app will come without any network usage,"" Mr. Donovan said on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress, a mobile-industry conference, here. Carriers have been considering different pricing models for years as they look for ways to make more money from skyrocketing mobile-data use. But AT&T's approach would be novel, an attempt to push some of the cost of data traffic back onto the Internet companies and other service providers that profit from it. It is far from clear how willing technology companies would be to pay wireless carriers for data use. Mr. Donovan said there was interest from companies that could use the feature to drum up new business from customers wary of using data-heavy services like mobile video. ""What they're saying is, why don't we go create new revenue streams that don't exist today and find a way to split them,"" Mr. Donovan said of the technology companies. The incentive—or cudgel—for technology companies to participate comes from AT&T and Verizon Wireless's shift from unlimited data plans to ones that charge users higher monthly fees as their data consumption goes up. A customer nearing his data limit for the month could be more likely to download a movie if the content provider covered the price of the data transmission. ""It'd be like freight included,"" Mr. Donovan said. Some consumer advocates reacted with dismay, arguing that AT&T could stifle competition and shift the playing field toward well-heeled app developers and content providers that have the financial capacity to subsidize mobile customers' data use. ""You have to raise all this additional capital to reach the customer or alternatively you have to compete with well-established players who can afford to pay,"" said Harold Feld, legal director for consumer group Public Knowledge. By allowing some companies to pay for better services for wireless customers, AT&T could be wading back into the ""net neutrality"" debate that played out in recent years. Proponents of net neutrality say that telecommunications companies shouldn't be allowed to give special treatment to some service providers, because doing so would threaten the ideal of the ""open Web,"" where easy access to customers lets new competitors like Facebook Inc. spring up quickly. Telecom companies say they need to have the flexibility to manage traffic on their networks. They also chafe at being sidelined as ""dumb pipes,"" relegated to spending billions to maintain networks while Internet companies collect much of the profit from the traffic. Prepaid carrier MetroPCS Communications Inc. drew criticism from net-neutrality advocates last year after offering unlimited YouTube usage alongside its smartphone plans. The company no longer offers that plan, and a spokesman said YouTube never paid MetroPCS to subsidize data traffic. The Federal Communications Commission has adopted ""net neutrality"" rules that are stricter for landline networks than mobile ones, and Public Knowledge said it would be tough to challenge AT&T's plan under the FCC's rules. Mr. Donovan, in the interview on Monday, said AT&T needed to find creative ways to deal with and profit from surging mobile-data use. ""There's a view of an entitlement that says that any impediment to riding over the top of our network is inherently wrong, is un-American,"" Mr. Donovan said. The FCC declined to comment.

201202,Dispatches from Barcelona's Mobile World Congress,"AT&T Plans to Make App Makers Pay for Data AT&T Inc. is preparing a service that would let content providers and developers of mobile applications pay the wireless carrier for the mobile data its customers use, the carrier's network and technology head John Donovan said in an interview Monday at the Mobile World Congress. Mr. Donovan likened the service to toll-free calling for the mobile-broadband world. The move comes as carriers are hunting for new ways to make money on the rising data traffic on their networks, while mindful of limits on what consumers are willing to spend. ""A feature that we're hoping to have out sometime next year is the equivalent of 800 numbers that would say, if you take this app, this app will come without any network usage,"" Mr. Donovan. It's far from clear how willing technology companies would be to pay wireless carriers for data use. Mr. Donovan said there was interest from companies who could use the feature to drum up new business from customers wary of using data-heavy services like mobile video. Today, customers of AT&T and Verizon Wireless generally face higher monthly fees as they consume more data. Mr. Donovan said AT&T's rollout of a faster, broadband wireless technology called LTE would make such a service possible. -- Anton Troianovski Ericsson Switches Tack To Focus on Software Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, normally seen as a maker of hardware for telephone networks, is shifting its focus to software as the technology evolves and as it grapples with pricing pressure from China. Chief Executive Hans Vestberg, speaking ahead of the Mobile World Congress said software now makes up more than half of its business. ""We're often described as a manufacturer of equipment, but if you look at the size of our software and services businesses last year, it made up over 60% [of revenue],"" Mr. Vestberg said. While older mobile equipment was hardware intensive and contained few software components, the emerging fourth-generation mobile equipment is just the opposite. ""A radio base station used to be the size of a small room. Today it's the size of a coffee maker, but with a way higher capacity and a much larger software component,"" Mr. Vestberg said. Ericsson is the world's largest maker of wireless network equipment with a 36% market share -- roughly twice the size of its nearest rival, China's Huawei. But it is also the fifth-largest software company, behind Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp., Oracle Corp. and SAP AG., according to annual rankings from Software Top 100. Ericsson also faces pressure from low-cost manufacturers such as Huawei and Hong Kong's ZTE Corp. -- Sven Grundberg Samsung Aims to Displace Nokia Atop Sales Chart Samsung Electronics Co., the world's second-largest cellphone maker by revenue, is aiming to sell 380 million handsets and double sales of its smartphones this year, according to a senior executive.

201202,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc. Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says sales to consumers dropped 23 percent from a year earlier. HP is the world's largest maker of PCs, but it's been performing badly as buyers in the industrialized world are turning their attention to Apple's iPads and Macs. Meanwhile, it hasn't been able to capture the growing appetite for PCs in emerging markets. Revenue from commercial businesses fell 4 percent. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. says it closed four times the number of seven-figure deals in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In the current quarter, the company got its first nine-figure deal ever. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. says its profit sank 64 percent in its fourth quarter and gives a lackluster sales outlook. The company expects hard disk memory sales to bounce back as much as 20 percent, but anticipates wireless segment sales to decline sequentially in the current quarter due to seasonal factors. It also expects networking sales to be flat. Coming up: Unknown: Oracle Corp. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says net income fell 44 percent, while sales fell 7 percent in the first full quarter under new CEO Meg Whitman. Contributing factors included weak demand from consumers and the shortage in disk drives. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. reports strong earnings that validated its approach of delivering software and services over the Internet rather than on individual computers. Some of the initial enthusiasm cooled, though, after investors factored in growth from a change in billing frequency. Coming up: March 19: Adobe Systems Inc. March 29: Research in Motion Ltd.

201202,Windows 8: Microsoft poised to preview company's most important piece of software in decades,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Microsoft is scrambling to preserve what's left of its kingdom. Since the company released its Windows operating system in 1985, most of the sequels have been variations on the same theme. Not that it mattered much. Regardless of the software's quality, Microsoft managed to remain at the center of the personal computing universe. The stakes are much different as Microsoft Corp. puts the finishing touches on Windows 8 -- perhaps the most important piece of software the Redmond, Wash., company has designed since co-founder Bill Gates won the contract to build the first operating system for IBM Corp.'s personal computer in the early 1980s. A test, or ""beta,"" version of the revamped operating system will be unveiled Wednesday in Barcelona, nudging Windows 8 a step closer to its anticipated mass market release in September or October. The company will offer the most extensive look at Windows 8's progress since it released an early version of the system to developers five months ago. Microsoft designed Windows 8 to help it perform a difficult balancing act. The company hopes to keep milking revenue from a PC market that appears to be past its prime, while trying to gain a stronger foothold in the more fertile field of mobile devices. It's a booming market that, so far, has been defined and dominated by Apple Inc.'s trend-setting iPhone and iPad and Google Inc.'s ubiquitous Android software. ""Microsoft's future path is riding on Windows 8 and its success,"" said Gartner Inc. analyst David Cearley. ""This is a chance for Microsoft to re-establish itself in a market where it's becoming increasingly irrelevant."" If Windows 8 is a hit, it could also help lift the fortunes of struggling PC makers, including Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. Besides giving businesses and consumers a reason to consider new PC purchases, Windows 8 is expected to spawn a new breed of hybrid machines that will be part tablet computer, part laptop. If Windows 8 is a flop, however, it will increase the pressure on Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. His 12-year reign has been marred by the company's troubles adapting to an Internet-driven upheaval. As Microsoft has stumbled, faster-innovating companies such as Apple and Google have elbowed their way into a position to steer the direction of computing for the next decade or two. Ballmer, known for his zealous faith in Microsoft, hails Windows 8 as the catalyst for an exciting -- and lucrative -- new era at the 37-year-old software maker. Investors seem to be believers, too. Microsoft's stock gained 52 cents Tuesday to close at $31.87, the highest closing price since April 2008. The shares have climbed by 23 percent so far this year. By comparison, Apple's stock has surged 32 percent during the same period, while Google's shares have dropped 4 percent. Microsoft's financial performance traditionally improves when it releases a new version of Windows. The last upgrade came in October 2009 when Windows 7 hit the market. The company has sold more than 525 million copies of Windows 7 since then. Part of Window 7's success stemmed from pent-up demand; the previous version, Vista, was so clunky and buggy that many PC users stuck with the system they already had on their machines or switched to Apple's technology on Mac computers. Windows 8 is radically different from its predecessors. The system won't even have Microsoft's familiar ""Start"" menu. All applications are spread across a mosaic of tiles, as part of a design Microsoft calls ""Metro."" The tiles, which resemble road signs, can be navigated with a swipe of the finger on the display screen or with a keyboard and a computer mouse. The tiles also provide a glimpse at the activity occurring in applications connected to the Web, such as email. The system also is expected to enable users to easily back up their pictures, movies, music and other files on a Microsoft storage service called SkyDrive, which will compete against Apple's iCloud. The operating system's versatility means it can be used to power computer tablets, as well as traditional PCs. Microsoft badly wants a piece of the tablet market that has been cutting into PC sales since Apple introduced the iPad two years ago. In the quarter that included the holiday shopping season, Apple shipped 15.4 million iPads, more than doubling the volume from the same time a year earlier. Meanwhile, worldwide personal computer sales dipped slightly, and Microsoft's revenue in its Windows division declined 6 percent. It marked the fourth time in the past five quarters that Microsoft's Windows revenue has fallen from the previous year. Reversing or slowing that trend is critical for Microsoft. It still relies on the PC industry for about 55 percent of its revenue, according to Nomura Equity Research analyst Rick Sherlund. ""The launch of Windows 8 should provide a few years of robust growth and opportunity for Microsoft to reposition itself to better defend its position against challengers,"" Sherlund wrote in a note after Microsoft reported the latest erosion in its Windows division. Besides spurring more sales of the new operating system, Windows 8 is likely to drive demand for the next generation of the Office suite, another major moneymaker for Microsoft. Windows 8 could inspire more PC makers to design machines that combine the convenience of tablets with the utility of a notebook computer. These devices would be similar to the so-called ""ultrabook"" computers that offer a Windows-based version of Apple's lightweight MacBook Air machines. Once Windows 8 is available, the ultrabook line could be expanded to include machines equipped with a screen that swivels off the keyboard to take advantage of the system's touch controls and provide a tablet-like experience. Microsoft clearly envisions Windows 8 becoming the foundation for pure tablets, too. That's why it's developing a version of Windows 8 that can run on the more tablet-friendly microprocessor technology licensed by ARM Holdings. That version will complement the Windows 8 design that will run on the Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. chips that power most PCs. HP, the world's largest PC maker, is already counting on Windows 8 to deliver better times. The company's division that includes desktop and laptop computers suffered a 15 percent drop in revenue during its more recent quarter ending in January. CEO Meg Whitman said last week that HP expects to release PCs and tablets running on Windows 8 in time for the holiday shopping season. HP's Windows 8 product line will include a tablet designed for corporate customers. The biggest question hanging over Windows 8 is whether the long wait for the software will leave Microsoft hopelessly behind Apple and Google in mobile computing. Whatever headlines Microsoft grabs during Wednesday's preview are likely to be quickly overshadowed next week when Apple is expected to show off the third version of the iPad. Meanwhile, Google says more than 300 million smartphones and tablets are already running on its Android software, with another 850,000 devices getting activated each day. At that rate, another 155 million to 180 million devices could be running on Android by the time Windows 8 comes out in September or October. As it is, a version of Android is already running the second hottest-selling tablet, Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle Fire. ""Microsoft is late to the game and this is a different game than they have been playing,"" Cearley said. ""But if they hit a home run with Windows 8, it could still turn some things around."" 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,"One Year Later, Nokia And Microsoft Deliver","BARCELONA, Spain -- One year ago, Jo Harlow, the head of smart devices at Nokia, stood before a packed convention hall at the Mobile World Congress, the cellphone industry's most important trade show, to explain the Finnish company's new software alliance with Microsoft. It was only a few days after the agreement had been announced in London. But the need for the deal had been so urgent that Nokia and Microsoft, grasping for a foothold in a mobile computing industry that was quickly slipping away from them, had gone public without a definitive legal agreement, just a handshake and a promise to work together, somehow. ''I remember standing on that stage and saying that I would deliver one device by the end of the year,'' Ms. Harlow said during an interview last week. And she said she thought to herself: ''Now I really have to do it.'' One year later, Nokia and Microsoft have exceeded their own predictions, and by most estimations, the expectations of many in an industry now dominated by Apple, the smartphone market leader, and Samsung, the No. 2, whose lineup relies on smartphones running Google's Android operating system, the most ubiquitous phone software. On Monday, Nokia introduced an enhanced, third-generation cellphone network version of the Lumia 900 that will sell globally outside the United States and an LTE version for Canada. It introduced the Lumia 610, which will cost about 30 percent less than the Lumia 710. At the same time, Microsoft said it planned to open new Windows online marketplaces in 28 countries by March, including China. Nokia delivered two Windows devices in 2011: the Lumia 800, a premium phone, and the Lumia 710, a lower-price version. In January, the company said it would sell a version of the Lumia 900 in the United States that would run on AT&T's new network using superfast Long Term Evolution, or LTE, technology, something even Apple does not yet offer for the iPhone. Ms. Harlow, 49, the captain of Duke University's women's basketball team her senior year, had faced pressure before. She explained to the crowd of analysts and journalists gathered at the annual industry convention here last year that Nokia and Microsoft would produce their first phone using the Windows operating system by the end of the year -- a pace two to three times quicker than Nokia's previous rhythm. But deep down, even Ms. Harlow was a bit awed by the task before her, which would require an accelerated, effective collaboration with a completely different corporate culture in a creative endeavor so intimate that both would have to discard mutual mistrust to make it work. Stephen A. Elop, Nokia's chief executive, said during an interview at this year's Barcelona trade show that the relationship with Microsoft had gone well. Mr. Elop said that neither he nor Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive and Mr. Elop's former boss, had had to intervene to arbitrate disputes in the mixed teams of Nokia and Microsoft employees working on Lumia. ''We have regular reviews where we sit down and go through all the details and have debates about the best way forward, but the teams are quickly able to move through these issues and get to a common point,'' Mr. Elop said. ''A year later, it is all focused just on going forward and not examining, 'What did we say in the contract?' We're getting stuff done.'' But the United States is still the most vexing market for Nokia. ''The big question will be how they tackle the U.S. market, where they have virtually no presence anymore,'' said Mark Newman, an analyst with Informa Media and Telecoms in London. By the end of 2011, Nokia said, it had sold more than a million Lumia phones, which Mr. Newman characterized as good but ''underwhelming.'' The wider price range introduced on Monday with the new phones and the expanded geographic footprint provided by the new online marketplaces will increase the potential market for Windows phones by 60 percent globally, said Terry Myerson, a vice president of Microsoft's Windows phone unit. That market has so far been limited primarily to the United States, Japan and Western Europe. Officials from both Microsoft and Nokia declined to disclose details on the companies' strategy, the promotional budget or the method chosen for trying to persuade the other three big operators in the United States, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile USA, to sell their phones. Mr. Myerson said Microsoft was aware that Windows was not a dominant force in mobile devices. ''We recognize that Windows phone is the challenger in the market against established alternatives,'' he said. ''We have tried to get a very clear point of view about why users should choose Windows phone.'' One of the major reasons, he said, is that Lumia Windows phones are ''faster at the everyday tasks that busy people have to do every day.'' Ms. Harlow said Nokia and Microsoft were far along on their plans for the United States and the rest of the world. The companies' work on Lumia devices is split among five locations: San Diego, Beijing and Taiwan and Salo and Tampere in Finland. ''We are focused on generating demand with consumers and doing the appropriate things across all media,'' said Ms. Harlow, who has spent time in all Lumia locations over the last year, working with people from Microsoft and Qualcomm, which is making the chips for the phones. ''We have what we believe is a comprehensive plan put together with AT&T to ensure that sales associates are knowledgeable and excited and ready to sell the story.'' Nokia is a distant No. 3 in smartphone operating systems. Its aging Symbian, the proprietary smartphone operating system that Nokia is phasing out for Windows, had only 12 percent global market share in December and it was declining fast. (Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, is the other sick man of the industry, with a declining 9 percent share, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.) The combined share held by Windows, which includes phones made by Nokia, HTC and Samsung, is just 1.7 percent. A wild card will be Google's plans for Motorola Mobility, which Google is set to acquire for $12.5 billion. Microsoft hopes that if Google converts Motorola into a high-volume global maker of Android phones, Samsung, the biggest user of Android, would be driven to another operating system -- perhaps Windows. Lee Younghee, senior vice president for global marketing of Samsung Electronics mobile products, described Samsung's work with Google at the Mobile World Congress as a ''strong partnership'' but noted that Samsung had consciously followed a mixed strategy of Android, Windows and Bada, Samsung's proprietary operating system. ''We believe that Android is a growing market,'' Ms. Lee said. ''We believe there are other sectors where will need a strong partnership with Google, not just in research and development, but marketing. But we can say that as long as we can maintain this business model with Google, our relationship can be well managed. I think so far we are O.K.'' Referring to Google's purchase of Motorola, Ms. Lee confirmed that the companies' relations were still good. ''Even after their announcement,'' she said.

201202,"Your Life, Broadcast Live","When Looxcie, the tiny video camera that fits over the ear, came out in 2010, it gave navel gazers an opportunity to record and share the minutiae of their daily lives. Looxcie records in a continuous five-hour loop, allowing users to capture events in their lives, both unexpected and mundane, without lugging around a video camera. An Instant Clip button on the phone lets videographers send a clip of the last 30 seconds to a social network with a single click. Seeking to increase the level of instant gratification, the makers of the tiny camera have introduced a new service called LooxcieLive, a mobile app that allows users to broadcast their video instantly by putting it in the cloud. Friends and family members are invited beforehand to view an event, like a baseball game or a birthday party, that they can watch via a live stream. It's just like live television, but without a five-second delay to censor the occasional obscenity or wardrobe malfunction, so use caution. And with LooxcieLive, viewers get to talk back. Texting and audio push-to-talk features allow them to interact with the broadcaster while the video is streaming. The camera comes in two models: the $150 version offers five hours of recording capacity; for $180, you get 10 hours. LooxcieLive is free and available at Apple's App Store and the Android Market. Set-up is fairly easy. Once the unit is charged and the software is updated, the device will sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth. Two other apps are available: LooxcieMoments, which captures hours of continuous video and shares clips, and LooxcieCam, which allows the device to operate like a basic, hands-free camcorder. The makers of Looxcie envision users wearing the camera continuously as they go about their daily lives; however, after wearing it for about 10 minutes, my ear was turning red. To help alleviate redness and soreness from extended wear, Looxcie comes with a variety of earbuds and earloops. Pick the ones that best fit your ear. And be warned: once you start using Looxcie, it's easy to forget it's recording every moment, which can become expensive. You are responsible for any data usage charges while the video streams to the cloud or sends clips to the Web, and the video consumes a lot of data. A 60-second video I shot of my cat was 24 MB.

201202,PREVIEW-Microsoft unveils Windows 8 for public test,"* Public test of new system available Wednesday * To be compatible with ARM chips for tablets, cellphones * Challenge for Microsoft is to attract apps developers * Analysts expect sales bump but dipping margins * Shares hit four-year high at $31.85 By Bill Rigby SEATTLE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp unveils the first widely available test version of Windows 8 on Wednesday, giving the public the first chance to try out the slick, new-look operating system it hopes will restore the company's fading tech supremacy. Windows 8, as the first Microsoft operating system compatible with low-power microprocessors designed by ARM Holdings Plc, will run on tablets as well as desktops and laptops. ""The operating system has begun to be seen as largely irrelevant,"" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen, which holds Microsoft shares. ""This is the release that will have to prove its relevance all over again."" Tablets and smartphones and cloud computing have made Bill Gates' vision of ""a computer on every desk and in every home"" seem quaint, and Apple Inc and Google Inc and Amazon.com now set the agenda for the computing industry. Still, all of those companies' fancy new hardware devices need basic operating software, and Microsoft is betting there is still more than a little room for Windows. ""The big increment here is that it'll be viable on the ARM platform, that there'll be a tablet form factor -- that kind of makes it a big deal,"" said Dan Hanson, a portfolio manager at BlackRock, which holds 5 percent of Microsoft's shares through various funds. ""Microsoft correctly identified the relevance of the tablet form factor over a decade ago. This operating system may allow them to finally execute."" THE PRODUCT Windows 8 will come in two main flavors -- one that works on the traditional x86 chips made by Intel Corp for desktops and laptops, and a new version for the ARM microprocessors that have become the standard for tablets, smartphones and other portable devices. Microsoft says it is aiming to get machines running on both the ARM and Intel platforms into the market at the same time but has not set a target date. In both versions, Windows 8 features a completely new interface, borrowed from what Microsoft calls the ""Metro"" style of the current Windows Phone software. It features blocks or 'tiles' that can be moved around the screen or tapped to go straight into an application. The tiles update in real time, so you can see if you have emails, voice messages or Facebook notifications at a glance. If PC and laptop users do not like the new format, they can revert to the old style with a click of the mouse. The key for any operating software -- be it Apple's iOS for iPhones and iPads, Google's Android software for smartphones, or Windows -- is to attract the support of the software developers who build applications, and on that score Windows 8 is off to a decent start. ""The biggest hurdle our designers have had is trying to get inside the mood of a Metro user, where less is more,"" said Paul Murphy, business development manager at Aviary, which makes a photo editing tool that can be integrated into iOS and Android apps. ""That was and still is a challenge, but I think now that they've been at it for a couple of months, they actually really like it. They appreciate the simplicity of the design."" Developers who have already created apps for Microsoft's Windows Phone are finding it easier to adapt to Windows 8, said Ryan Lowdermilk, who hosts a popular podcast for apps builders. ""Porting your code over, people are finding that to be pretty straightforward. But as far as finishing that last mile where some of this newer technology for Windows 8 comes into play, they are finding little hiccups and bugs here and there."" WINDOWS + OFFICE = $ The Windows 8 release has to be good, and soon, say industry experts. ""Now that the tablet market is being defined by the iPad and the (Amazon) Kindle, if they come out with a buggy first version, they won't get a second chance,"" said Michael Cherry, a former Microsoft engineer who now works at independent research firm Directions on Microsoft. ""They can't afford to disappoint customers."" Microsoft has not put a timetable on the final release, but Windows unit head Steven Sinofsky has said new versions of Windows should be no more than three years apart, which would put a Windows 8 debut around October 2012. The public will get its first good look at Windows 8 on Wednesday, when Sinofsky launches the ""Consumer Preview"" at an event in Barcelona. Everybody will be able to download a test version of Windows 8 that will run on PCs and laptops based on Intel chips. But they won't get to try out Windows 8 on an ARM tablet until later this year. Initial buyers for Windows tablets are expected to be consumers, as most business users have not yet even moved onto Windows 7. But the long-term success of Windows 8 will depend on Microsoft's core business customers. A Windows tablet that works seamlessly with Microsoft's Exchange email system and Office applications would be a godsend for corporate technology managers, who have been bending over backward to put their CEO's iPads -- ""executive jewelry,"" as one analyst puts it -- onto their company's email and security systems. Microsoft's killer punch is Office. After months of silence, Sinofsky confirmed earlier this month that the world's most popular suite of work applications, including the newest versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, will come installed on tablets running the ARM version of Windows. That's a big and potentially risky departure for Microsoft, which has in the past sold Office separately. They will not be in the new ""Metro"" style, but they will be optimized for touch. That would give Windows tablets a unique selling point over iPads and Android tablets. HIGH STAKES Even a wildly successful Windows 8 might be less profitable for Microsoft than its predecessors, simply because the company won't be able to charge nearly as much for software that runs a $400 tablet than it could for software running a $1,500 PC. The Windows unit averages about $80 per PC sold now, but will likely get half that from tablets, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts estimate. Wall Street is expecting a bump in Windows sales for at least 12 months after the release, fueled by consumer demand for tablets but does not foresee a spike matching the hot-selling Windows 7. Analysts are estimating a 12 percent jump in Microsoft's earnings per share for each of the next two fiscal years, which is better than the flat expectations for this year, marred by lackluster PC sales. But it is not exceptional for a company that posted nearly 30 percent increases in earnings per share for the last two fiscal years. Gross profit margins, while still comparatively high, are expected to drift slightly lower. Several analysts have recently raised their outlook for next year's earnings, helping the stock rise to a four-year high on Tuesday, partly buoyed by building interest in Windows 8. ""The next four to six quarters will be extremely important for Microsoft,"" said Parakh at McAdams Wright Ragen. ""They have to prove they too have a competitive product, not just on traditional desktop PCs and laptops but on the tablet and even phones. And this is their chance.""

201202,UPDATE 3-Micron buys Intel stake in flash JV for $600 mln,"* Buy to help gain from fast-growing NAND demand * To buy stake in Singapore, Virginia memory plants * Micron to supply flash memory to Intel * Micron shares up 7 pct (Adds background, details; updates shares) By Himank Sharma Feb 28 (Reuters) - Micron Technology will pay $600 million to buy back Intel Corp's stake in two wafer factories as the chipmaker bets on the fast-growing NAND flash market to offset margin erosion in its mainstay memory chips. NAND memory, used in portable storage devices such as USB drives and smartphones, are fast replacing hard drives in notebooks -- such as the super-thin Ultrabook laptops that Intel promotes. Intel had invested in the JV in 2006 to spur growth in the then-emerging technology. NAND has since gained prominence as computing power shifts to smartphones and tablets. As part of the agreement, Micron, the largest U.S.-based maker of computer memory chips, will continue to supply NAND chips to Intel. ""Micron is going to get as much as a 30 percent more capacity from the deal and they would now be able to sell a significant portion of this back to Intel at an incremental profit,"" Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann told Reuters. Intel pays Micron almost $1 billion annually for flash memory. The deal is expected to give Micron better margins on at least half of these sales, without increasing supply. Wells Fargo analyst David Wong said in a note that it made sense for Intel to enter into the initial joint venture to drive growth of NAND supply, and it is now an appropriate time to exit given Micron's lead in investing in the venture. Micron got about 40 percent of its revenue from DRAM chips -- used as primary memory in PCs -- in the last fiscal but oversupply has dented margins. Top DRAM maker Elpida Memory filed for bankruptcy on Monday. Analysts expect Micron to buy some of Elpida's NAND factories. CHEAP BUY Intel and Micron formed the joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, investing $1.2 billion each in cash, notes and assets. As part of the sale, Intel will get half of the $600 million in cash while the rest will be deposited with Micron, to be refunded or adjusted against Intel's future purchases. ""It's a great deal for Micron, they're getting it for the cheap,"" Raymond James' Mosesmann said. According to Intel's latest annual filing, the carrying value of its stake in the JV stood at $1.3 billion as of Dec. 31. On Tuesday, the companies said Intel sold the stake at about their book value. ""Intel might take a charge of as much as $700 million for this transaction,"" Wells Fargo's Wong said. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of this year, subject to certain conditions, the companies said. Boise, Idaho-based Micron will buy Intel's stake in their Manassas, Virginia, and Singapore factories. The $3 billion Singapore facility, capable of making almost half of the JV's capacity of flash memory, started production last April. The JV's third manufacturing facility in Utah will continue to operate with minimal changes, the two companies said in a statement. Micron shares jumped 7 percent to $9.16, and were trading at $9.02 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq. The stock gained 7 percent on Monday after Elpida's bankruptcy filing. Intel shares were up 1 percent at $27.27.

201202,UPDATE 2-TomTom warns on 2012 performance,"* Expects 2012 sales of 1.1 bln euros, vs 1.2 forecast bln * Sees 2012 adjusted EPS 0.35 euro, vs 0.55 euro in 2011 * Outlook for personal navigation devices uncertain * Q4 net profit 12 mln euros, vs forecast 13 mln * Shares down 16 pct (Adds comment from company, analyst) By Roberta Cowan AMSTERDAM, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Struggling Dutch vehicle navigation systems maker TomTom said sales and profit will continue to fall this year as more consumers opt for free software on smartphones, hitting it shares. ""The visibility in our core PND (personal navigation device) markets is limited as there remains great uncertainty about the rate of decline of customer demand for the category,"" chief executive Harold Goddijn said on Tuesday. TomTom, which posted quarterly results that met forecasts, said it expected 2012 revenue of around 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and adjusted earnings per share of 0.35 euro, compared with 1.27 billion and 0.55 euro, respectively, in 2011. Sales for 2012 had been forecast at 1.2 billion euros in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll. Analysts, including Martijn den Drijver at SNS Securities said, TomTom's outlook for EPS was ""worrying"". TomTom shares were down 16 percent at 3.68 euros at 1125 GMT. Fourth-quarter net profit fell 76 percent to 12 million euros, on sales down 31 percent to 357 million. The results were in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll. TomTom has struggled to overcome slumping demand for PNDs used by car and truck drivers, as smartphones become more prevalent. PND, its biggest division and which makes up around two thirds of group sales, saw quarterly sales fall 40 percent. TomTom, which competes in the PND market with Garmin and in the commercial digital map market with Google and Nokia, also sells real-time traffic services through internet-connected devices and smartphone apps, mapping data to businesses, as well as navigation units which are built into cars, including Fiat, Mazda and Renault models. STRATEGY Goddijn reiterated that TomTom was focusing on areas with the greatest potential to grow -- fleet management services, built-in car systems, licensing digital maps and content. These areas account for around a third of its revenue. TomTom had issued two profit warnings in 2011, in April and June, and announced cost cuts and a strategy shift in October, when it revised targets to reflect the dismal outlook for PNDs. While TomTom is moving to provide content and built-in systems, arch rival Garmin, which is stronger in the North American market, has focused more on fitness and outdoor products and high-margin mapping services. Garmin reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Feb. 22 and forecast a strong year ahead driven by demand for its fitness products, as athletes and joggers spend more on watches with GPS sensors, golfing accessories with preloaded courses and fitness apps. TomTom's founders, who have a major stake, have maintainted their intention to remain an independent company. Goddijn reiterated that stance on Tuesday.

201202,IPhone's Crutch of Subsidies,"BARCELONA -- For Google Inc., Europe's economic turmoil has had a silver lining: Smartphones that use the Internet giant's software are crushing the iPhone in countries hard hit by the continent's debt crisis. Last year, despite Apple Inc.'s high-profile launch of the new iPhone 4S, only 5% of the smartphones sold in Greece and 9% of those sold in Portugal were iPhones, according to research firm IDC. Most of the rest were phones running Google's Android operating system. The results point to a rare weak spot for Apple -- its heavy reliance on subsidies from wireless carriers to make its iPhones affordable to a wider range of consumers. The practice has proved to be a big advantage for Apple, which posted a 73% jump in revenue in its latest quarter, at the expense of carriers such as Sprint Nextel Corp., which started carrying the iPhone last fall but doesn't expect to make a profit on the device until 2015. In countries like the U.S. and the U.K., carrier subsidies helped the iPhone win more than 20% of the smartphone market last year. But its performance in parts of southern Europe where most consumers don't sign contracts and have to pay full freight for phones suggests Apple's position could suffer if carriers tire of underwriting most of the cost of the devices, as some are in countries such as Denmark and Spain. ""Smartphone penetration and adoption is being helped by the entry of lower-price devices, which basically are Android devices,"" said Carlos Alberto Silva, a spokesman for Portuguese carrier Optimus. Android phones that cost less than $200 without a contract are widely available in Europe, helping Google undercut the iPhone. In Portugal, at wireless carrier Vodafone Group PLC, the cheapest Apple phone -- an eight-gigabyte version of the older-model iPhone 4 -- sells for $680, according to the carrier's website. Phones running Android can be had for as little as $106, and even Samsung Electronics Co.'s high-end Galaxy S II is cheaper than the cheapest iPhone. At Greece's largest wireless carrier, Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications SA, the most popular smartphone sold last year was Samsung's Galaxy Mini, said Dimitris Koutsonas, head of mobile data and services. The price: $188 without a contract. ""In this economic situation, we had to push the low-end smartphone,"" Mr. Koutsonas said. ""Our competitors are much more dependent on such subsidies,"" said John Lagerling, Google's director of Android partnerships. ""If you have very expensive devices as the only ones available to access your ecosystem, then that can come with a pretty severe hangover in the long run."" In the U.S., carriers pay Apple an estimated $400 every time a customer buys an iPhone with a two-year contract, analysts say. Sprint has acknowledged that iPhone subsidies run 40% higher than for other smartphones on average. The goal is to make it easy to buy the phone then make the money back and a profit over time on service contracts. Contract-free ""prepaid"" carriers, on the other hand, leave consumers to pay the full price of a phone. Wall Street has grilled Apple on its strategy for prepaid carriers, even as the company sold a record 37 million iPhones in its most recent quarter, more than double the year-earlier tally. The company has kept a nearly three-year-old model, the iPhone 3GS, on the market to appeal to budget-minded buyers. But the 3GS still sells for $535 without a contract at Greece's Cosmote. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts in January that it ""was too early to tell"" how the lower-priced versions would perform in the prepaid market over time but that the company was ""thrilled"" with iPhones sales as a whole. At an investor conference this month, Mr. Cook added that emerging markets, which often use the prepaid model, are ""critical"" for the company, but that each country is different and some may evolve over time. Apple, he said, had persuaded China Unicom to try a contract and subsidies approach in addition to its prepaid one, and that it had performed well. The debate over device subsidies is part of a tug of war between mobile operators, Internet companies and phone makers seeking control and profits in the wireless industry. All three are gathering in Barcelona this week for an annual industry conference. Carriers around the world are having second thoughts about subsidizing phones, presenting a risk for all phone makers -- not just Apple. That became clear in Denmark last year after several leading wireless carriers stopped subsidizing phones and lowered their monthly rates to keep up with competitors. ""We saw that the customers valued lower prices on calling plans, and simpler calling plans, higher than the subsidy on the phone,"" said Jon Erik Haug, CEO of the Denmark unit of Oslo-based wireless operator Telenor ASA. In Spain, Telefonica SA is also having doubts. ""We can't keep subsidies at these levels,"" Jose Miguel Gilperez, CEO of Telefonica Spain, recently told Spanish newspaper El Pais. ""When you buy a TV or any other consumer good, you pay for it. It is healthier that users pay for their devices and operators invest in networks and services."" --- Amir Efrati and Jessica E.

201202,Orange to offer smartphone with 'Intel Inside',"* Orange adopts Intel reference smartphone * Intel races to catch up in mobile processors * Phone to be manufactured by Gigabyte By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The ""Intel Inside"" logo on hundreds of millions of personal computers is finally making its way onto a smartphone. France Telecom's mobile unit Orange will launch a smartphone in France and the United Kingdom this summer designed by Intel and using its newest processor. While the handset will be branded by Orange, its back cover will also boast the Intel swirl that consumers have come to expect to see on PCs over the past two decades. That's a major milestone for Intel, whose chips are the brains in 80 percent of the world's laptops and desktop computers but power virtually no smartphones or tablets to date. With PC sales flagging in the United States and Europe, nearly all smartphones and tablets, including Apple Inc's iPhones and iPads, use energy-efficient processors based on technology licensed to chip designers by Britain's ARM Holdings and made by Intel rivals like Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm Inc. The new smartphone will run Google's Android platform and be among others that Orange sells under its own brand. Aimed at Orange's entry level, pay-as-you-go clients, the phone is a copy of a reference handset Intel created to showcase its newest mobile chip to potential customers, with features like high-definition video and an 8-megapixel camera. ""This is a really big deal for us,"" Mike Bell, who co-heads Intel's mobile and wireless business and who is responsible for creating the reference phone, told Reuters. ""It's phenomenal that Orange has asked us to participate and put our Intel logo on the back."" Orange has hired Taiwanese hardware company Gigabyte to manufacture the phones and is adding its own flavor by installing additional proprietary software. With Wall Street concerned Intel is being left behind in the mobile market, the Santa Clara, California chipmaker has been pouring resources into improving its offerings for smartphones and tablets. Previous attempts fell flat but Intel says its newest mobile processor, codenamed Medfield, stands up to rivals' chips in power efficiency and performance. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, Intel impressed technophiles with demonstrations of its reference smartphone and said Motorola Mobility and Lenovo have picked Medfield for upcoming handsets. Intel launched its ""Intel Inside"" brand campaign in 1991, and its success at making customers loyal to a particular component in PCs, known as ingredient branding, defied many expectations at the time and has since become a case study.

201202,Samsung Aims to Double Smartphone Sales,"SEOUL—Samsung Electronics Co., the world's second-largest cellphone maker by revenue, is aiming to sell 380 million handsets and double sales of its smartphones this year, according to a senior executive. The comment from J.K. Shin, president of Samsung's mobile-communications division, suggests that the Korean company, which is widely expected to soon surpass Nokia Corp. as the biggest seller of cellphones, will continue to position its mobile division as the key driver of profitability to make up for falling revenue in other businesses, such as displays. According to Strategy Analytics, Samsung sold 327.4 million handsets last year, trailing Nokia's 417.1 million unit sales. Last year, Samsung, the world's largest technology firm by revenue, sold 97 million smartphones, according to Mr. Shin. In a bid to better compete against the likes of Apple Inc. and Nokia in the fast-growing smartphone and tablet-computer markets, Samsung was set to unveil several products at this week's Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. Samsung is unveiling the new 10.1-inch Galaxy Note, which is positioned as a cross between its Galaxy S smartphone and Galaxy Tab tablet computer in terms of functionality and size plus added features. The Galaxy Note allows users to jot down notes on the product with a specially designed pen. Samsung will also unveil the Galaxy Beam, a projector smartphone that allows users to display and share photos, videos and other content stored in the device onto walls and other flat surfaces.

201202,Business Highlights,"------ Sales contracts for homes rose 2 percent in January WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose in January to the highest level in nearly two years, supporting the view that the housing market is gradually coming back. The National Association of Realtors said Monday that its index of sales agreements rose 2 percent last month to a reading of 97. That's the highest reading since April 2010, the last month that buyers could qualify for a federal home-buying tax credit. A reading of 100 or higher is considered healthy. ------ Detroit automakers race to keep up with sales DETROIT (AP) -- Auto sales are growing so fast that Detroit can barely keep up. Three years after the U.S. auto industry nearly collapsed, sales of cars and trucks are surging. Sales could exceed 14 million this year, topping last year's 12.8 million. The result: Carmakers are adding shifts and hiring thousands of workers around the country. Carmakers and parts companies added more than 38,000 jobs last year, reaching a total of 717,000. And automakers have announced plans to add another 13,000 this year, mostly on night shifts. ------ Gulf oil spill trial delayed for settlement talks NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A judge has delayed the federal trial over the worst U.S. offshore oil disaster for a week, saying that BP PLC was making some progress in settlement talks with a committee overseeing scores of lawsuits. Two people close to the case told The Associated Press that the decision was made Sunday during a conference call between parties in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill case and U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the call. They said the judge told those on the call that BP and the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee were ""making some progress"" in their settlement talks. The steering committee is overseeing lawsuits filed by individuals and businesses following the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20, 2010. The blast killed 11 workers, injured 17 and led to 206 million gallons of oil spewing from the blown-out well. ------ Mild winter warms Lowe's 4Q profit NEW YORK (AP) -- Lowe's Cos. said Monday that its fourth-quarter net income rose 13 percent, better than analysts expected, as homeowners took on more home-improvement projects during unusually mild winter months. The results are another sign that the housing sector may be slowly improving. Last week larger rival Home Depot Inc. reported its fourth-quarter profit rose for similar reasons. ""We have seen an uptick in activity,"" Lowe's CEO Robert Niblock said in a telephone interview. ""We did have favorable weather, but even beyond that there's a greater willingness of the consumer to spend."" Home repair and maintenance are still the biggest projects people take on, he said, with demand for larger-scale renovations such as kitchen remodeling lagging, Niblock said. ------ Nokia pins hopes on cheaper Windows smartphone BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Struggling cellphone maker Nokia kicked off the world's largest mobile phone trade show Monday by unveiling a new low-cost Windows smartphone that cellphone companies could give away free to customers, and another aimed at consumers demanding better photo quality. CEO Stephen Elop told reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that the new phones -- a $254 smartphone that runs on Windows software and a handset with a high-resolution 41 megapixel camera -- demonstrate ""the actions necessary to improve the fortunes of Nokia."" ""With great products for consumers, I think the rest will fall into place,"" Elop said. In many countries, cellphone companies subsidize the sale of smartphones to customers who sign contracts. The low price of the new phone means their out-of-pocket costs would be low, even if they give the handset away. ------ Buffett says stocks, homes are fairly cheap now OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett said Monday that stocks remain relatively cheap compared to other investments as the economy continues to improve. He also said that the company he heads is prepared to replace him whenever the need arises. The chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. addressed a variety of topics during an interview on the cable TV network CNBC, two days after his annual letter to the conglomerate's shareholders was released. Buffett said even though stocks aren't as cheap as they were during the depths of the recession in 2008, they're still a more attractive long-term option than bonds, gold, cash or anything else. ------ Government moves to convert foreclosures to rentals WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is looking to sell off some of its stock of homes in foreclosure. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has control over roughly 250,000 foreclosed homes owned by Fannie Mae. One percent of those homes -- 2,500 -- will be available for investors to buy and convert into rentals. Officials say the foreclosure-to-rental program can help reduce credit losses and stabilize home values. Homes in foreclosure sell at a 20 percent discount on average, which can hurt surrounding home values. Investors can submit applications to purchase properties owned by Fannie Mae in some of the nation's hardest hit metro areas -- Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Phoenix and parts of Florida. ------ Economists see more reasons for optimism this year NEW YORK (AP) -- Economists are increasingly confident that some pillars of the U.S. economy will improve this year, but they still remain cautious in their expectations on the overall pace of economic growth. The National Association for Business Economics said Monday that forecasters have raised their expectations for employment, new home construction and business spending this year. But they held on to their average prediction that America's gross domestic product, or GDP, will grow at a rate of 2.4 percent. That's a slight improvement from 2011, when economists believe the economy grew 1.6 percent. Final economic growth numbers for 2011 are due out Wednesday. GDP reflects the economy's total output of goods and services. The latest forecast is in line with one issued by the group in November that called for the economy to grow 2.4 percent this year. Forecasters predict growth will be stronger in the second half of 2012 than it will be through June. ------ German lawmakers approve new Greek bailout BERLIN (AP) -- The German parliament approved a second, $173 billion loan package for Greece on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned lawmakers that it would be irresponsible to abandon the country to bankruptcy. Although the motion was expected to be easily approved -- the final tally Monday was 496-90 with five abstentions -- the idea of bailing out Greece has remained very unpopular in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, among the public and many politicians. The rescue package is Greece's second in less than two years and also involves private-sector investors accepting total losses of more than 70 percent on the bonds they hold, along with tough new austerity measures. ------ By The Associated Press(equals) The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.44 points and closed at 12,981.51. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.85 points to 1,367.59, a 3 1/2-year high. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.41 points to close at 2,966.16, its highest since December 2000. Benchmark crude fell by $1.21 to end the day at $108.56 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil that's imported by U.S. refineries, lost $1.30 to finish at $124.17 per barrel in London. In other energy trading, heating oil fell by 3 cents to finish at $3.29 per gallon and gasoline futures lost 2 cents to end at $3.13 per gallon. Natural gas futures fell by 10 cents to finish at $2.45 per 1,000 cubic feet. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,Apple Smartphone Lead Not Guaranteed,"BARCELONA, Spain -- When Ellie Turner decided she wanted an upgrade from her iPhone 3G, she expected to pay more for Apple's new iPhone 4S than for the other leading smartphones on the market. Instead, Ms. Turner, a public relations specialist in London, got the fast-selling device free. She consulted Phones4u, a bulk discounter of cellphones and data packages, which offered her a free iPhone 4S and data plan for $:2, or $3.20, more than she had been paying each month. She returned to her operator, O2 U.K., which had been selling the 4S for $:99 with the same plan. She told people there about the rival offer. ''They didn't blink an eye,'' Ms. Turner said. ''They matched it.'' Apple, the global market leader in smartphones, is enjoying record profits and sales that have transformed it into the world's most valuable company on any stock market. But the mobile computing industry it has conquered in just five years is changing rapidly, and not even Apple's trend-setting image appears guaranteed. Unlike in the United States where competitors find it difficult to price a comparable phone lower than an iPhone, in Britain, the iPhone 4S costs at least $:170 more than the Samsung Galaxy S II with a two-year commitment at O2 U.K. At T-Mobile in Germany, the Samsung model costs about 80 euros, or $108, and the 4S 130 euros. But the iPhone retains its enviable image as the phone to which all others are compared. It is Apple's reward for being the progenitor of the modern smartphone segment: the sum of its software DNA, intuitive user experience, cash-generating universe of applications, cultivated image of hipness and first-mover advantage. But Apple's main rivals -- Samsung and other sellers of cellphones using the Google Android operating system, like HTC of Taiwan and Huawei and ZTE of China -- are making smartphones for much less, and the iPhone is becoming ubiquitous, threatening its cachet. For now, said T. Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in Minneapolis, the iPhone lineup has momentum and Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., should be able to pad its lead over rivals this year. ''But I cannot say with certainty that five years on, Apple will still be on top,'' Mr. Walkley said, noting that Apple and HTC did not even make smartphones six years ago. ''I assume they will be, but it is difficult to predict anything in this dynamic market.'' He estimated that Apple had captured 52 percent of all profits in the smartphone industry in 2011, a share he predicted would increase to 60 percent this year. Apple, following its tradition of participating only in its own promotional events, has no formal presence or exhibition stand at the Mobile World Congress, the industry's largest annual convention this week in Barcelona. Alan Hely, an Apple spokesman in London, said the company had no comment for this article. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, told a Goldman Sachs investment conference this month that Apple would not rest on its laurels after its record fourth quarter, in which it sold 37 million iPhones -- 17 million more than it had ever sold in a quarter. Tongue in cheek, Mr. Cook called the 37 million ''pretty good,'' drawing laughs, but then put it in stark perspective: ''As I see it, that 37 million for last quarter represented 24 percent of the smartphone market. So three out of four people bought something else. And it represented less than 9 percent of the handset market, so nine out of 10 people are buying something else. ''The smartphone market last year was a half billion units,'' he continued. ''In 2015, it is projected to be a billion units. When you take it in the context of these numbers, the truth is, this is a jaw-dropping industry. It has enormous opportunities to it. Up against those, the numbers don't seem so large anymore.'' Carrying the iPhone has benefited operators, who use it to attract new customers. Sprint, the No. 3 carrier in the United States after AT&T and Verizon, sold 1.8 million iPhone 4S's in the fourth quarter, its first sales of Apple models. In that period, the operator added 1.6 million customers, the biggest such increase in six years. Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Vodafone have also spoken of the positive effect iPhone sales have on their profits. But over time, the iPhone could be undermined by its own success. ''All of a sudden, every teenage girl has an iPhone,'' Mr. Walkley said. ''The real danger is that Apple becomes so mainstream that there is a breakaway by consumers to something new.'' Apple's competitors are awaiting that chance, said Mark Newman, the director of mobile research at Informa Telecoms and Media, a research business in London. That puts pressure on Apple to continue innovating with each new iPhone. The 4s, which looked no different from the iPhone 4, added Siri, the Apple voice-activated command function introduced with the iPhone 4S, which helped make it a top-selling phone. ''Apple is focused on defending the high end of the market, and that is becoming harder to do each year,'' Mr. Newman said. ''Competitors, such as the Galaxy from Samsung, are starting to catch up. I think it is inevitable that the margin pressure increases.'' That pressure is not evident at Apple, which continues to derive more than 40 percent operating profit from the sale of each smartphone, Mr. Walkley estimated. In 2011, Apple became the world's largest buyer of semiconductors, according to Gartner. It displaced LG of Korea as the No. 3 maker of mobile phones by volume, trailing only Nokia and Samsung. Apple narrowed the lead held by Android, the free operating system developed by Google. By last December, 44.5 percent of all smartphone buyers in the United Sttes were choosing iPhones, up from just 25.1 percent last October. The proportion choosing for Android fell to 46.9 percent from 61.6 percent, according to Nielsen. Patrick Remy, the vice president of devices at France Telecom in Paris, said he saw no sign of the Apple brand's diminishing. On the contrary, Mr. Remy said, Apple and Samsung have the financial resources to invest in the marketing, image and innovation that are needed to stay a step ahead of the competition. ''We are not seeing any major part of these brands declining,'' Mr. Remy said. But competition, especially from lower-price rivals, is not standing still. By 2016, more than half of all smartphones sold will cost less than $300, according to Informa. Last year, 81 percent -- most of them iPhones -- cost more than $300. The proportion costing less than $200, which currently makes up 5 percent of the global market, is expected to increase almost fivefold, to 24 percent, by 2016. Shao Yang, the marketing director for mobile devices at Huawei -- the Chinese maker of mobile networking equipment which has set a goal of being among the world's top three cellphone makers by 2015 -- said consumers would be able to obtain superior performance for less in the future. ''I think currently the biggest trend is not the price, but the capability,'' Mr. Shao said. ''There is a competition in capability. The function of the phone will change very fast.'' Huawei, based in Shenzhen, sold 20 million smartphones last year, up from 3.1 million in 2010. Huawei sold about half of its smartphones in China for between $150 and $200. Its biggest foreign market is the United States, where Huawei in January presented the Ascend P1 S, calling it the thinnest smartphone at 6.65 millimeters, or 0.26 inch. The P1 S will not start selling until April, and Huawei has not released the price. But Mr. Shao said it would cost less than an iPhone. ''Smartphones are going to become cheaper and cheaper,'' he said. Apple, though, is represented in the low-price smartphone segment. The iPhone 3, a predecessor, is being given away with a $:16.50 plan at O2 U.K., while the iPhone 4 is free with a $:36 plan. PHOTO: An Apple store in London.

201202,New Nokia Phone Ramps Up Resolution to 41 Megapixels; Bits,"BARCELONA -- While Nokia's expansion of its Windows Lumia phone business with Microsoft dominated its announcements at the industry's annual convention, the Finnish handset maker had a few other tricks up its sleeve, including a new phone with an astounding 41-megapixel camera. The new camera phone, called the Nokia 808 PureView, runs on the in-house Symbian operating system that Nokia is phasing out for Windows. Nokia researchers developed the camera and its associated proprietary software by adapting satellite imaging technology, said Mary McDowell, the Nokia executive vice president in charge of its non-smartphone business. (By way of comparison, the camera on the iPhone 4S model has 8 megapixels, and cameras used by professional photographers generally have around 20.) Nokia plans to transfer the optical technology to its other lines, including Windows. The Nokia 808 PureView will sell for 450 euros, or $599, excluding taxes and operator subsidies, starting in May. The camera wowed the 300 analysts and journalists at Nokia's news conference at the World Mobile Congress, putting the high-resolution imaging capability of a Google Earth-like optical engine into an innocuous looking cellphone. It also boasts CD-quality recording ability, which was demonstrated at Nokia's press conference to eardrum-piercing perfection. Nokia also did not neglect its bread-and-butter basic cellphone business, announcing three new handsets for its Asha line, which targets emerging markets. The Asha 202 and 203 phones, both touch screen devices with keypads, target the 3.2 billion people in the world who still don't have a mobile phone and the 1.2 billion who do, but do not have a data plan. The devices are being sold for 60 euros, excluding taxes and operator subsidies. The 202 is a dual SIM-card phone; the 203 can handle one SIM card. Both handsets come with 75 euros of free mobile games from Electronic Arts. The Asha 302 is a phone that aims at heavy users of social networking services and at business users looking for an affordable data phone . It has a standard QWERTY keypad and is the first Nokia phone to support Microsoft's Mail for Exchange push email for corporate e-mail users. Using the Microsoft software, the phone can synchronize and update emails, contacts and calendar entries. The Asha 203 has a suggested retail price of 95 euros. ""The Asha phones are a low-cost entry point to data consumption,'' Ms. McDowell said. ""That is what it's all about. Historically, feature phones have had great voice capabilities. But increasingly, consumers everywhere are demanding a rich, cost effective data experience.'' * Nokia Chief Says No Plans for Merger With Microsoft * Nokia Exploring Tablet Computer With Microsoft * Huawei Takes On Apple and Samsung With the Ascend * Facebook Makes Push for Beefed-Up Mobile Sites * Android Tablets: Catching Up in 2012 The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120227e82r002bd ",NYT Blogs,27 February 2012,494 words,new nokia phone ramp resolution megapixels bit,barcelona nokias expansion window lumia phone business microsoft dominated announcement industry annual convention finnish handset maker trick sleeve including new astounding megapixel camera called nokia pureview run inhouse symbian operating system nokia phasing nokia researcher developed associated proprietary software adapting satellite imaging technology said mary mcdowell nokia executive vice president charge nonsmartphone way comparison iphone model megapixels used professional photographer generally around nokia plan transfer optical including nokia pureview sell euro excluding tax operator subsidy starting may wowed analyst journalist nokias news conference world mobile congress putting highresolution capability google earthlike engine innocuous looking cellphone also boast cdquality recording ability demonstrated nokias press eardrumpiercing perfection nokia neglect breadandbutter basic announcing three asha target emerging market asha touch screen device keypad billion people still dont data sold excluding dual simcard handle one sim card come free game electronic art asha heavy user social networking service affordable standard qwerty first nokia support microsofts mail exchange email corporate using microsoft synchronize update calendar entry asha suggested retail price asha lowcost consumption m mcdowell historically voice increasingly consumer everywhere demanding rich effective experience nokia chief merger microsoft nokia exploring tablet computer microsoft huawei apple samsung ascend facebook make beefedup site android catching york time company document nytberbd
201202,Nokia Chief Says No Plans for Merger With Microsoft; Bits,"BARCELONA -- Nokia and Microsoft, partners in smartphones, are not in talks about an equity partnership or a formal merger, the Nokia chief executive, Stephen Elop, said in an interview. ""My expectation is that it stays as a collaboration,'' Mr. Elop, a former senior Microsoft executive, said at the opening of the Mobile World Congress, the industry's annual convention. ""There's never been a discussion about anything else.'' Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, and Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., announced their joint effort to make Windows smartphones in February 2011. Since then, they have produced four: the Lumia 800, the Lumia 710, the Lumia 900 and the Lumia 610. Speculation that the project would lead to a Microsoft takeover of Nokia has surfaced periodically, but has always been denied by both companies. Despite what he calls an excellent working relationship, and the fact that ""there are certain aspects of what Nokia does that are of great interest to Microsoft and vice versa,'' Mr. Elop said there were no plans to explore deepening the relationship. ""There are many elements of Nokia that are unrelated to what we're doing in smart devices,'' Mr. Elop said. ""Fully, broadly speaking, half of our business is on products and in markets and in areas which are not the area of focus for Microsoft as it relates to their devices strategy. So in terms of what it would mean to do something differently, it would be pretty complicated. So we don't anticipate anything there.'' Mr. Elop called the Lumia 610, which has a suggested retail price of 189 euros, or $251, a symbol of the cooperation between Nokia, Microsoft and Qualcomm, the San Diego company providing the chip processors for the Lumia lineup. At Nokia's request, Samsung designed a special chip for the 610 which requires only a quarter of the usual memory, 256 megabytes of dynamic random access memory, to deliver the same performance. The lower-cost chip allowed Nokia to trim the price of the 610, which goes on sale in April, by 30 percent from its predecessor, the Nokia 710. * Nokia Exploring Tablet Computer With Microsoft * New Nokia Phone Ramps Up Resolution to 41 Megapixels * Huawei Takes On Apple and Samsung With the Ascend * Facebook Makes Push for Beefed-Up Mobile Sites * Android Tablets: Catching Up in 2012 The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120227e82r001xh ",NYT Blogs,27 February 2012,408 words,nokia chief say plan merger microsoft bit,barcelona nokia microsoft partner smartphones talk equity partnership formal merger nokia chief executive stephen elop said interview expectation stay collaboration mr elop former senior microsoft opening mobile world congress industry annual convention there never discussion anything else nokia based espoo finland microsoft redmond wash announced joint effort make window smartphones february since produced four lumia lumia lumia lumia speculation project lead microsoft takeover nokia surfaced periodically always denied company despite call excellent working relationship fact certain aspect nokia great interest microsoft vice versa mr elop explore deepening many element nokia unrelated smart device mr elop fully broadly speaking half business product market area focus microsoft relates strategy term mean something differently pretty complicated dont anything mr elop called lumia suggested retail price euro symbol cooperation nokia microsoft qualcomm san diego providing chip processor lumia lineup nokias request samsung designed special requires quarter usual memory megabyte dynamic random access deliver performance lowercost allowed nokia trim sale april percent predecessor nokia nokia exploring tablet computer microsoft new nokia ramp resolution megapixels huawei apple samsung ascend facebook push beefedup site android catching york time document nytberxh
201202,EURO CREDIT-,"Feb 27 (IFR) - It's a broadly cautious start to the week for European credit markets, consistent with another fairly sideways session in Asian risk markets overnight. At 07:40 GMT, the iTraxx Main index was quoted 0.75bp wider at bp at 131.5bp, with the Crossover 4bp wider at 580bp, according to Tradeweb. This also follows a largely flat close on Wall Street on Friday, although a 0.17% or 2.28 point gain to the S&P500 index was significant in that it saw the index close at its highest level since 06 June 2008, having risen more than 8% so far this year. An early focus is news that the largest global counties told Europe it must put up additional funds to fight its debt crises if it wants more help from the rest of the world, ramping up pressure on Germany to drop its opposition to a bigger bail out fund, Reuters reported. Eurozone countries pledged at the G20 meeting to reassess the strength of the bail out fund next month, potentially paving the way for countries to stump up more funds to the IMF. ""There is a broad agreement that the IMF cannot substitute for the absence of a stronger European forewall and the IMF cannot move forward without more clarity on Europe's own plans,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner said. This leaves Germany looking even more isolated ahead of the summit of EU leaders on Thursday, with today's vote by the German parliament on the second Greek bailout package likely to offer more signs as to this level of resistance. Previously German lawmaker have argued that imposing fiscal discipline on indebted countries is far more important to regaining the confidence of markets and reviving economic growth than bigger rescue funds. Another significant factor this week is the ECB's second 3-year LTRO on Wednesday. Market estimates for participation at what President Draghi suggests will be the last 3-year operation have been falling to around half the level seen a month ago when estimates of EUR1tn were commonplace. That points to the degree of healing in credit markets amid and active primary market for senior financials recently. Late on Friday Greece finally went bondholders with an official offer to kick-off the much-talked about PSI which is a prerequisite ahead of its EUR130bn second bailout. Also on the agenda this week is a significant pick-up of government supply, where Belgium get the ball rolling this session with tap sales on the OLO 2017, 2022 and 2041 lines (EUR1.9-2.9bn). Ahead of the Belgian auctions we note that a Government report released by domestic media over the weekend shows that an extra EUR2bn of savings will need to be found to satisfy the European commission to go with the EUR11.3bn of savings already outlined by PM Di Rupo. Italy follow on Tuesday with a tap on the 2017 BTP (Eur2-2.5bn) and also the launch of a new Sep 2022 line (EUR3-3.75bn), with Germany on Wednesday and Spain, France and the UK following on Thursday. Credit supply could also pick up notable this week after a fairly muted second half of last week, as the technical supply/demand back drop remains conducive for more opportunistic issuers from the corporate and financial space that come out of blackout. The strength of demand for new issues has been clearly reflected in the robust book sizes and positive secondary market performance for the majority of recent issues in an environment of shrinking new issue premiums. In the SSA sector, the European Union and EAA could emerge as soon as early this week having mandated banks for 20 and 30-year euro benchmarks respectively, while the Bank of England is on course to raise 3-year US dollar funding having also already mandated banks to spearhead the trade. Meanwhile, in the covered bond pace, Bankinter and CRH were amoung those issuers that were rumoured to be planning a near-term visit to the market. EARLY NEWS: HSBC Holdings is expected to report the West's biggest banking profit for last year, fuelled by the East, while its rivals are struggling with faltering European and U.S. growth. Europe's biggest bank is not entirely untouched by the slowdown, so its fourth-quarter profits on Monday will show a hit from lower investment bank income due to the euro zone debt crisis and potentially higher U.S. bad debts, just as its third-quarter figures did. But the bank should be far more resilient than rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, who slumped to big losses last year. A rival offer by two private equity funds for Italy's troubled insurer Fondiaria-SAI has hit a hurdle due to penalty clauses in an earlier bid from insurance peer Unipol and debt restructuring issues, sources close to the matter said. A meeting between the advisor of Fondiaria parent Premafin and top investment house Mediobanca on Friday discussed the difficulty of breaking off the deal with Unipol because of the penalty clauses that would ensue, one of the sources said. British banks Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland may access the European Central Bank's three-year, low interest loans facility this week, the Financial Times reported on Monday. Both indicated that the scheme, known as the three-year long-term refinancing operation, or LTRO, is attractive because of its low 1 percent interest rate. The newspaper said neither bank would comment on how much they planned to raise exactly through the facility. RBS, which took about 5 billion euros of LTRO money in its debut auction in December, is set to take a similar amount in Wednesday's sale, according to senior bankers cited in the article. Consumers' increasing love of using services like Facebook and YouTube on their smartphones is leaving many telecoms carriers sidelined while bearing the costs of ever-growing demands on their networks. As users lap up mobile Internet services, the Web giants are strengthening their relationships with consumers, while the telcos are finding their connections with customers reduced to a monthly bill and an occasional handset upgrade. RATINGS: Moody's affirms TUI at B3; outlook changed to positive from stable. Fitch Ratings has revised France Telecom's Outlook to Negative from Stable. FT's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'A-' has been affirmed. Fitch has simultaneously affirmed FT's hybrid instruments, the Titres a Duree Indeterminee Remboursables en Actions (TDIRA), at 'BBB and the Short-term IDR at 'F2'. Fitch Ratings has maintained Credito Fondiario S.p.A.'s (Fonspa Bank) Italian Residential and Commercial Primary Servicer Ratings of 'RPS2-' and 'CPS2-' respectively, on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). Fitch Ratings has assigned Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal S.A's three USD denominated unsecured notes issuance, with maturities ranging between 2015 and 2022 'BBB' ratings.

201202,Apple defeats Motorola in German court,"FRANKFURT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. technology group Apple scored a legal success over rival Motorola Mobility Holdings when a German court said it could no longer ask Apple to halt sales of iPhone and iPad devices for now. ""The licensing terms offered by Apple sufficiently addresses Motorola's interests,"" the higher regional court in Karlsruhe, Germany, said on Monday. Its decision was a preliminary assessment in an ongoing appeals process. Apple and Motorola -- which Google is in the process of acquiring -- are engaged in global patent litigation, part of a broader legal fight over the smartphone market, with billions of dollars at stake. Motorola won a temporary injunction in a Mannheim court in December that forced Apple to stop the sale of iPhone 3G and 4 models and 3G/UMTS-based iPads -- which Motorola said infringed some of its patents -- on its German online store. Apple has been fighting the injunction since then, saying Motorola should allow it to use its patented technology because companies in the mobile device sector cannot get around using it if they want to remain competitive. Motorola has said it has negotiated with Apple and offered it ""reasonable licensing terms and conditions since 2007"". The Karlsruhe court said Apple has now amended its counter-offer for terms twice to have the injunction overturned. ""At the current stage, which only allows a summary assessment of the two sides' arguments, it is to be assumed that Motorola would be in breach of its obligations under anti-trust legislation if it continued to demand that Apple does not sell the iPhone and iPad,"" the court said. In a separate dispute between the two companies, Apple was forced last week to deactivate ""push"" notification features for mobile users of its iCloud and MobileMe services in Germany, after an injunction in favour of Motorola. It is also locked in disputes over mobile patent infringement with other companies including Samsung Electronics and HTC, in several countries.

201202,UPDATE 1-Nomura cuts Marvel Technology to reduce,"* Cuts to ""reduce"" from ""neutral"" * Finds limited growth potential in 2012 Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Marvel Technology Group Ltd has limited potential to grow in 2012 and long-term margins are on the decline, brokerage Nomura said, downgrading the stock a notch to ""reduce."" Last week, the chipmaker had posted higher-than-expected fourth-quarter results. It had also forecast a revenue growth of up to 6 percent in the current quarter, banking on higher sales of its chips for hard drives as the PC industry recovers from a flooding in Thailand last year. Nomura said it expected Marvel to forecast some improvement in its wireless segment, but the company predicted a high-single-digit decline instead. The company's forecast of a total addressable market of 20 million to 30 million smartphones would suggest revenue of $125 million to $150 million in 2012, Nomura said. ""That's not meaningful, considering a revenue base of $3.5 billion,"" the brokerage said in a note to its clients. The brokerage, which kept its price target of $13 on the stock, said peers Broadcom, Avago and SanDisk are the preferred stocks to bet on in the semiconductor space. Shares of the company closed at $15.46 on Friday on the Nasdaq.

201202,UPDATE 1-Ericsson extends mobile gear lead with lower margins,"(Adds details) STOCKHOLM, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Ericsson, the world's top mobile network equipment maker, said on Monday it substantially extended its lead in the industry last year as it sacrificed margins in exchange for expanding its client base. Ericsson's core profit halved in the fourth quarter as it was hit by lower margins and a slowdown in the industry. Speaking at the technology industry's annual gathering in Barcelona, chief executive Hans Vestberg repeated the company's forecast that margins would remain under pressure for a couple of quarters as low margin projects and higher services sales dominate the business mix. But he said Ericsson's strategy of expanding its footprint with operators had been successful. ""Last year we were focusing on gaining market share, the early indication right now when we have closed 2011 is that we went from 32 percent market share to 38 percent market share in mobile infrastructure,"" Vestberg said. ""That is quite a big increase in market share in one year alone, reflecting our technology leadership, our position with the right customers in the right markets."" Ericsson's nearest rivals in mobile networks are Nokia Siemens Networks and China's Huawei. Consolidating its position in the market will mean Ericsson can cash in on the revolution in mobile telephony, driven by smartphones and tablets that are generating huge volumes of data traffic in networks. ""Last year we ended, if you take high data traffic smartphones, with roughly 10 percent of subscribers having that,"" Vestberg said. ""It .. shows how quickly it has grown, but also shows how much is left."" Operators will need fast, high-capacity networks to meet the demand for data, mainly video, over the next few years. They will also need new ways to charge and interact with customers as they use their mobiles to perform a range of activities from shopping to money transfer. That means new networks, upgrades of existing infrastructure and demand for new billing systems and services. On Monday, Ericsson launched a slew of new products to support operators in optimizing networks and offering new services, like money transfer, to clients. Ericsson estimates that there will be around 5 billion mobile broadband subscribers by 2016, up from around 1 billion today. There will also be around five times as many smartphone users generating about 10 times the level of today's data traffic. Ericsson's shares were down 2.44 percent at 66.05 crowns at 1227 GMT, underperforming a 1.83 percent decline in European tech stocks.

201202,Chinese target smartphone incumbents with cheap phones,"* Huawei sees 2012 smartphone sales rising 3-fold to 60 mln * Huawei says ready to undercut rivals prices by 15-20% * Huawei rolls out top-of-the-range model Ascend By Tarmo Virki and Lee Chyen Yee BARCELONA/HONG KONG, Feb 27 (Reuters) - While veterans Nokia and BlackBerry struggle for survival, the power in the surging smartphone industry has started to move to China where agile manufacturers are coming out with models comparable to their Western rivals, but at cheaper prices. In 2012, Chinese vendors Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp are set to grab more market share globally, analysts say, as they shift away from making basic feature phones to churn out more smartphones, a sector where growth is strong and profit margins are bigger. The two vendors combined sold 35 million smartphones last year, around 7 percent of the global market, and see 2012 sales rising to 90 million, doubling their market share to 14 percent. Huawei and ZTE, among the world's largest makers of telecom network equipment, have expanded into handsets and the tablet PC business and are now selling smartphones running on Google's Android operating system, taking on the lucrative market dominated by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, Huawei and ZTE unveiled their top-of-the-range models Ascend and Era, with technologies comparable to any of the top Android models. EYEWATERING Huawei said it aims to sell more than 60 million smartphones this year, a three-fold increase from 2011, while it is ready to sell products at prices 15-20 percent lower than the market. ""Huawei has firmly laid down the gauntlet to established rivals and its sales goal is an eyewatering target that will send a shiver down rivals' spines,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. Chinese smartphones, such as Huawei's IDEOS and ZTE's Blade, are gaining popularity worldwide, especially in emerging markets from Africa to India, mainly due to aggressive pricing and helped by selling network equipment to telecom carriers. ""Having the infrastructure business is a great benefit for us,"" He Shiyou, chief of ZTE's phone business, told Reuters, adding the company was packaging phones together with network gear when approaching carriers. ZTE expects operator-partnerships to help it to double its smartphone sales to 30 million handsets this year. Even at retailers, some of lower end models of Huawei and ZTE can be bought for around $100, the level where the demand is the highest, and there is no end in sight for falling prices. Chipset vendor Spreadtrum, smaller rival to Qualcomm and Mediatek, has rolled out a platform for $40 smartphones for the Chinese market. Late last year, Qualcomm launched a new set of its flagship Snapdragon chipsets targeted at low-cost Android smartphone makers. ""Mass market smartphones represent an important opportunity,"" said Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm's president and chief operating officer. ""The mass market smartphone segment is very competitive and device manufacturers need to launch products faster at lower engineering costs."" Growth in the global smartphone market is expected to slow in 2012 from around 60 percent growth seen in 2011, but it will still expand around 40 percent this year, helped by falling prices, research firm Gartner said. SALES JUMP ZTE and Huawei roughly doubled their global cellphone sales last quarter, outselling BlackBerry's RIM and HTC . In the smartphone sector, they continued to gain market share as they expand their reach in markets such as North America and through improved Android models, Gartner said. ""Chinese vendors are on the roll. China's smartphone market is surging and they use this momentum as a springboard to grow abroad as well,"" said Neil Mawston, analyst at research firm Strategy Analytics. Nokia has seen its global market share in smartphones falling to 12 percent in the last quarter from 30 percent a year earlier and has suffered also from ageing smartphone offering as it revamps to use Microsoft software. Nokia warned last month sales of its Symbian smartphone platform would not reach its expectations of more than 150 million units, while LG has struggled with shrinking market share for several quarters. Analysts said the success of the Chinese firms was starting to hit Sony and HTC as well. BRAND BUILDING Consumers like 15-year old Lin Jingfeng, a student in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen in China, bought a smartphone from ZTE last year at a fraction of the cost of an iPhone. ""I bought ZTE because it's much cheaper than the other phones that I saw and it's good enough for my purposes,"" he said. ""I don't play much games and I usually just use it to call my friends, surf the Internet or update my weibo (microblogging site)."" Analysts said Chinese firms needed to invest more into building their brand in developed markets, and could take a page from Taiwan's HTC, which has made a splash in mature markets. ""I believe we will become world's top class brand in devices,"" Shao Yang, marketing chief of Huawei's devices unit, said in an interview. Huawei and ZTE said the key for kick-starting smartphone sales was close co-operation with operators. ""The device is a big pain-point of an operator and we have a good channel to discuss with their technology and marketing departments. In Huawei we solve a lot of problems for them,"" Yang said. ""We care for our customers like no-one else.""

201202,UPDATE 4-Nokia aims wider with cheaper Windows smartphones,"* Lumia 610 priced at $250, excl subsidies, taxes * new PureView 808 model has 41 MP camera * shares down 6.6 pct (Adds details on cameraphone) By Tarmo Virki BARCELONA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia unveiled a cheaper smartphone using Microsoft's Windows Phone software on Monday, aiming to win back market share by targeting a wider audience. Nokia last year dumped its own smartphone software in favour of Windows Phone to step up its fight against rivals such as Apple's iPhone, but the high prices of its phones have been a major weak point. Nokia said its new Lumia 610 model would carry a price tag of 189 euros ($250), excluding subsidies and taxes, when it goes on sale next quarter. That compares with around $600 for the iPhone and other high-end smartphones. ""The 610 takes Nokia's Lumia portfolio to an encouraging new price point in its pursuit of cheaper Android rivals,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. Investors, however, were unconvinced the new models and pricing of Lumia 610 would do the trick, and Nokia shares were down 6.6 percent to 4.04 euros by 1457 GMT. Analysts noted that Asian handset makers such as Huawei and ZTE were coming out with even cheaper smartphones for closer to $100. ""I had hoped for a slightly lower price range. Maybe the markets were a bit disappointed with the price, which was quite high,"" Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen said, adding the shares had spiked on Friday in anticipation of the event. Nokia also announced a global version of its high-end Lumia 900 Windows Phone. THE THIRD WAY The move comes over a year after Chief Executive Stephen Elop compared Nokia to a ""man standing on a burning oil platform"" and teamed up with Microsoft to take on Apple and Google's Android phones. Wall Street and industry analysts say that although the latest Windows phones could be worthy competitors to Apple's iPhone and top-of-the-range Android handsets, the devices lack unique qualities to help sales take off. One way Nokia is trying to differentiate itself is with its cameras. On Monday, it unveiled a new top-of-the range cameraphone, the Nokia 808 PureView, packing a 41 megapixel sensor, significantly more than those in advanced cameras used by professional photographers. Analysts said the 808 model will still struggle as it uses Nokia's old Symbian operating system, although Nokia plans to adopt the camera technology for Windows Phones in the future. ""This innovation by Nokia and Carl Zeiss should worry compact camera makers like Canon and Nikon who are already under assault from the rise of the camera phone,"" CCS's Wood said. Microsoft's share of the smartphone market fell to just 2 percent last quarter, from 3 percent a year ago and 13 percent four years earlier, according to Strategy Analytics. Microsoft has the full backing of Nokia, but is struggling to get equal support from other handset makers, such as Samsung, which are clearly focused on their Android offerings. In addition to its struggle in high-end smartphones, Nokia also faces an increasing threat from Asian manufacturers. Analysts say both Huawei and ZTE are set to grab more market share globally in 2012, as they shift their focus from basic phones to smartphones. Huawei and ZTE are now selling smartphones running on Google's Android operating system, attracted to the higher margins the market provides. Both firms made new handset announcements at the same trade show, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

201202,INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-China's Xiaomi hopes for revolution in mobile market,"* Company produces inexpensive, high-spec smart phones * Eyes more financing within next 1-2 yrs -president * 2 mln handset sales target is conservative -president * No pressure for profitability -president (Adds details and quotes) By Melanie Lee SHANGHAI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chinese handset maker Xiaomi Technology is looking to raise more funds within the next year or two to boost production and sees revenue in the future coming from software applications rather than handset sales, the firm's president told Reuters on Monday. Xiaomi, whose name literally means millet but refers to a revolutionary idiom from the early days of the Chinese Communist Party, was founded in 2010 with a focus on becoming a mobile Internet company. The firm's first handset, called MiOne, was released in October to popular and critical acclaim, its draw being that it boasts high-end technical specifications, such as a dual-core processor and an eight mega-pixel camera, at an affordable price of 1,999 yuan ($320) -- less than half that of similar models from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. Xiaomi racked up more than 300,000 orders for the phone in less than two days at its launch, and it is now perpetually back-ordered, pointing to the need to expand production capacity. ""Manufacturing a phone is very capital intensive; it requires a large flow of capital,"" Lin Bin, president of Xiaomi, said in an interview. ""Within the next one to two years, we will have to select a time frame to raise and find suitable financing,"" Lin said. Xiaomi has raised $131 million in financing so far, including a B-round investment of $90 million done late last year that valued the firm at $1 billion. Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun told local media that his firm was targeting 5 billion yuan ($793.9 million) in revenue this year on 2 million handsets sold. ""I think that is a very conservative number,"" Lin said of that sales target. FOCUS ON USERS, NOT PROFITS The low price of the smartphone is due to Xiaomi selling the MiOne directly to customers via its website, thereby cutting down on distribution costs, Lin said. ""We are really not looking to make a lot of profit on the handset itself,"" Lin added. Lin was formerly the vice president of Google Inc's China Engineering Research Institute and he also previously worked at Microsoft Inc. The plan is for Xiaomi to monetise its software and applications in the future, he said. Beijing-based Xiaomi is looking to push out a new phone once every 9-12 months and will seek to break even on each handset. ""As an early stage start-up, our shareholders do not expect us to turn profitable any time soon. Our key focus right now is to continue to polish this product and make it great and continue to improve the performance of our software,"" Lin said. Lin declined to comment on rumours in the market about Xiaomi's second-generation smartphone. Xiaomi's MiOne phone runs the firm's self-developed mobile operating system, MIUI, which allows users to personalise many aspects of the phone, Lin said. China, the world's largest mobile phone market, is highly competitive for handset makers. With the number of mobile subscribers set to top 1 billion in China this year, there is cut-throat competition among Samsung, Apple, Taiwan's HTC Corp and local firms Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp . Underscoring that pressure, HTC launched a new series of smartphone models touting advanced cameras and music functions at the Barcelona Mobile World Congress on Sunday. Low-priced smartphones, such as those provided by ZTE, Huawei and Xiaomi, have eaten into Apple's share of the market. In the last quarter, Samsung came out on top, with 24.3 percent of China's smartphone market, more than three times Apple's share, data from research firm Gartner showed. [ID:nL4E8DH0SV ] Lin said the key to competing with the likes of Apple and Samsung would be to push out high-quality devices with good technical specifications, at affordable prices. ""It's about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area. Having this business innovation may revolutionise the handset industry,"" Lin said of Xiaomi's name, based on a Chinese idiom that calls on fighters to have millet and a rifle on hand to be ready to fight.

201202,"UPDATE 4-HTC bets on cameras, music to recover smartphone mojo","* HTC builds challenge to Apple, Samsung around cameras and music * Jury still out on whether new models will spark a revival * Strategy ""pragmatic"" but rivals also moving the same way-analyst * Samsung throws down gauntlet with aim to double sales this year * Pricing a key, but new models won't be cheap-company source (Edits, adds background) By Tarmo Virki and Clare Jim BARCELONA/TAIPEI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan's HTC Corp has turned to advanced cameras and music functions for a new range of phones at the centre of its bid to recover from a rapid fall from grace in the tough and fickle smartphone market. The world's No. 5 smartphone maker launched the HTC One series of models at the Barcelona Mobile World Congress on Sunday, taking the fight to Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc with fast graphic chips and advanced music and photography functions. It is a fight that HTC was losing at the end of last year, when its sales slumped and investors dumped its shares on concerns the firm had lost its edge. Analysts said the new devices represented a pragmatic choice for a company that lacks the resources of its deep-pocketed rivals. ""HTC seems to have learned from mistakes it made in 2011,"" said Malik Saadi, Principal Analyst at Informa Telecoms & Media. ""The company aims now to concentrate on what they do best and have built their brand on: bringing innovation through design of premium devices rather than spreading efforts across all segments of the market."" Rapid innovation was the hallmark of HTC's lightning rise from obscure contract maker to purveyor of must-have gadgets. Its shares more than tripled in the 14 months to April 2011 and sales grew fourfold in 1-1/2 years as it rode a wave of popularity. But an equally swift fall at the end of last year, as its phones failed to keep up with Apple and Samsung, saw HTC forced to issue a profit warning and its stock price plunge 42 percent, making it the worst performer among global smartphone companies. Amid investor fears it would follow Finland's Nokia in a sharp downward spiral, HTC said earlier this month that revenue may fall as much as 36 percent for the first quarter, much worse than analysts expectations. One user of HTC phones said the fun factor was missing. ""When my contract comes up, I'm thinking of switching to Samsung's Galaxy Note because it doubles up as a tablet and looks quite fun to play around with,"" said Phoebe Leung, a software business analyst in Hong Kong who has been using HTC Aria over the past year or so. Employees felt the sting of the downturn too, with some saying they felt let down by the company for its slide and lack of endeavour to bring in real innovation. ""It's not as fun working here as I expected,"" one engineer told Reuters. Others said the company had tightened up on bonuses and had told staff that spending must be controlled, a change from a previous habit of lavish spending. Its focus has been on turning around its fortunes, and senior management has said it will stick to its strategy of innovation for the high-end market and is confident the new models will get it back on track. MUSIC AND PICTURES The HTC One series consists of three models, the One X, One S and One V, running the latest version of Google's Android software. They have fast processors for graphics and either polycarbonate or metal cases HTC says are harder and more resilient than standard ones. The phones feature HTC's ImageSense camera technology that it says offers photography on a par with traditional digital cameras, including fast autofocus and low-light shooting. They also have photo storage and sharing software. Music features include integrating Internet radio and using audio technology from Beats Electronics, which HTC bought last year, for games as well as music. HTC said 144 mobile operators -- the widest carrier support for the firm so far -- have agreed to carry HTC One range models starting from April. ""The products look competitive, but HTC executives will be looking over their shoulders nervously to see how these new devices stack up against rival Android smartphones also being announced at the show,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. Others note also that most mobile vendors are building their phones around similar themes, so it is harder to differentiate models. Companies will need to look to software, innovation, distribution and building partnerships to stay ahead of the game. ""HTC's strategy to streamline its branding and to offer fewer, better-differentiated products is a reaction to both market forces and engineering necessity,"" said Tony Cripps, principal analyst at Ovum. ""Its decision to focus on perfecting core smartphone functionality around camera and music playback is an extremely pragmatic one."" HTC immediately faced a challenge from No.1 maker Samsung, whose mobile chief said ahead of the Barcelona show that it aimed to nearly double its smartphone sales in 2012 from last year Meanwhile Apple is likely to release the next version of its iPhone this year, and up and coming challengers such as China's Huawei are also breathing down HTC's neck, with Huawei releasing what it says is the world's fastest quad-core smartphone at Barcelona. ""HTC's industrial design is similar to before, there's no breakthrough, but its hardware is closing the gap with Samsung and Apple,"" said Roxy Wong, analyst at Mirae Asset Management in Hong Kong, noting the new cameras and screens in the phones. ""The new phones will not serve as major turnaround for the company. If it sells with more attractive prices, it could see a gain in market share but not profitability."" Wong added that HTC's move to unify its products around a single brand name, as Samsung does with its Galaxy devices and Japan's Sony Corp does with Xperia, is a good move because it would be easier for consumers to remember its phones and their features. However, HTC is likely to stick to its ""high-end brand"" strategy to offer full user experience. One HTC source with knowledge of pricing said the new phones will be priced similar to Samsung's ones with similar specifications. ""HTC phones this year will not be cheap,"" the source said. HTC's shares will resume trade on Wednesday, Feb. 29, when the Taiwan stock exchange reopens following a two-day public holiday. They last closed at T$629, well off their peak of T$1,238.10 in April last year, a price that had made Chairwoman Cher Wang top of Forbes' Taiwan rich list last year.

201202,IPhone's Crutch of Subsidies,"BARCELONA—For Google Inc., Europe's economic turmoil has had a silver lining: Smartphones that use the Internet giant's software are crushing the iPhone in countries hard hit by the continent's debt crisis. Last year, despite Apple Inc.'s high-profile launch of the new iPhone 4S, only 5% of the smartphones sold in Greece and 9% of those sold in Portugal were iPhones, according to research firm IDC. Most of the rest were phones running Google's Android operating system, which the company is promoting heavily as it seeks a firmer foothold in the wireless industry. The results point to a rare weak spot for Apple—its heavy reliance on subsidies from wireless carriers to make its iPhones affordable to a wider range of consumers. The practice has proved to be a big advantage for Apple, which posted a 73% jump in revenue in its latest quarter, at the expense of carriers such as Sprint Nextel Corp., which started carrying the iPhone last fall but doesn't expect to make a profit on the device until 2015. In countries like the U.S. and the U.K., carrier subsidies helped the iPhone win more than 20% of the smartphone market last year. But its performance in parts of southern Europe where most consumers don't sign contracts and have to pay full freight for phones suggests Apple's position could suffer if carriers tire of underwriting most of the cost of the devices, as some are in countries such as Denmark and Spain. ""Smartphone penetration and adoption is being helped by the entry of lower-price devices, which basically are Android devices,"" said Carlos Alberto Silva, a spokesman for Portuguese carrier Optimus. Android phones that cost less than $200 without a contract are widely available in Europe, helping Google undercut the much more expensive iPhone. In Portugal, at wireless carrier Vodafone Group PLC, the cheapest Apple phone—an eight-gigabyte version of the older-model iPhone 4—sells for $680, according to the carrier's website. Phones running Android can be had for as little as $106, and even Samsung Electronics Co.'s high-end Galaxy S II is cheaper than the cheapest iPhone. In markets like the U.S., where consumers generally pay $200 or $300 for smartphones regardless of the brand, price isn't as much of a factor. The reverse is true in Greece, Portugal, and elsewhere, where carriers don't subsidize most smartphones. At Greece's largest wireless carrier, Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications SA, the most popular smartphone sold last year was Samsung's Galaxy Mini, said Dimitris Koutsonas, head of mobile data and services. The price: $188 without a contract. ""In this economic situation, we had to push the low-end smartphone,"" Mr. Koutsonas said. As a result, more than 60% of the smartphones sold by Cosmote last year were Android phones, Mr. Koutsonas said. The success of Android helps Google to ensure that its search engine—its most important source of revenue—as well as mapping and other services, are preloaded on mobile devices, through which consumers are spending more time online. Google licenses Android to hardware manufacturers essentially free, doesn't get a cut of device sales and takes only a small share of revenue generated from app sales for Android devices. The software company hopes the wider range of prices for Android phones boosts their adoption—and helps the operating system gain traction with carriers wary of subsidies and customers leery of contracts. ""Our competitors are much more dependent on such subsidies,"" said John Lagerling, Google's director of Android partnerships. ""From a sustainability standpoint, if you have very expensive devices as the only ones available to access your ecosystem, then that can come with a pretty severe hangover in the long run."" In the U.S., carriers pay Apple an estimated $400 every time a customer buys an iPhone with a two-year contract, analysts say. Sprint has acknowledged that iPhone subsidies run 40% higher than they do for other smartphones on average. The goal is to make it easy to buy the phone then make the money back and a profit over time on service contracts. Contract-free ""prepaid"" carriers, on the other hand, leave consumers to pay the full price of a phone. Wall Street has grilled Apple on its strategy for prepaid carriers, even as the company sold a record 37 million iPhones in its most recent quarter, more than double the year-earlier tally. The company has kept a nearly three-year-old model, the iPhone 3GS, on the market to appeal to budget-minded buyers, including prepaid users. But the 3GS still sells for $535 without a contract at Greece's Cosmote. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts in January that it ""was too early to tell"" how the lower-priced versions would perform in the prepaid market over time but that the company was ""thrilled"" with iPhones sales as a whole. At an investor conference this month, Mr. Cook added that emerging markets, which often use the prepaid model, are ""critical"" for the company, but that each country is different and some may evolve over time. ""I don't really subscribe to the premise that a prepaid market is a prepaid market is a prepaid market,"" he said. Apple, he said, had persuaded China Unicom to try a contract and subsidies approach in addition to its prepaid one, and that it had performed well. ""You can bet that we are into details in every single country in the world trying to learn what we can to adjust, maybe to do better into the future,"" Mr. Cook said. The debate over device subsidies is part of a tug of war between mobile operators, Internet companies and phone makers seeking control and profits in the wireless industry. All three camps are gathering in Barcelona this week for an annual industry conference. Carriers around the world are having second thoughts about subsidizing phones, presenting a risk for all phone makers—not just Apple. That became clear in Denmark last year after several leading wireless carriers stopped subsidizing phones and lowered their monthly rates to keep up with lower-priced competitors. ""We saw that the customers valued lower prices on calling plans, and simpler calling plans, higher than the subsidy on the phone,"" said Jon Erik Haug, CEO of the Denmark unit of Oslo-based wireless operator Telenor ASA. In the second half of last year, after Danish carriers stopped offering subsidies, phone sales declined about 10% from the second half of 2010, according to IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo. Smartphone sales continued to grow, but at a much lower rate than in 2010. In Spain, telecom giant Telefónica SA also is having doubts. ""We can't keep subsidies at these levels,"" José Miguel Gilpérez, CEO of Telefónica Spain, recently told Spanish newspaper El País. ""When you buy a TV or any other consumer good, you pay for it. It is healthier that users pay for their devices and operators invest in networks and services."" For phone makers, any change by carriers could have an impact on the sales of high-end devices. In the U.S., where contract plans and phone subsidies dominate, IDC says that around 90% of smartphone shipments over the past four years were for devices that cost more than $300—despite the recession and uncertain recovery. In Italy, where prepaid plans dominate, that proportion was 67% last year, and in crisis-hit Greece and Portugal, only about 40% of the smartphones shipped in 2011 cost more than $300.

201202,France Télécom to Use Intel Chips,"Intel Corp. has netted a smartphone win in the European market, with France Télécom's Orange unit becoming the third company to announce plans to use the Silicon Valley company's chips for the mobile devices. The French cellular carrier, continuing a strategy of offering phones under its own brand as well as other hardware, said it will introduce an Intel-powered smartphone this summer in France and the U.K. Intel, the dominant supplier of microprocessors for computers, has been struggling for years to move its franchise into handsets. The pocket-sized devices are typically powered by chips based on designs from ARM Holdings PLC, in large part because those chips tend to draw less power and allow longer battery life in phones. But Intel believes the latest version of a chip line called Atom, code-named Medfield, has achieved rough parity with ARM-based competitors on power consumption. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd. in January became the first smartphone makers to announce plans to use the chips, which Intel has been pitching using hardware mockups called reference designs that run Google Inc.'s Android operating system. Orange's smartphone is a bit smaller than Intel's reference design, weighing 117 grams, or 4.1 ounces, and measuring less than 10 millimeters, or 0.4 inch thick. The device is designed to compete with products such Apple Inc.'s iPhone, with selling points that include the ability to run high-definition video and Orange-designed applications and services. ""We didn't just pick up our reference design and say, 'Here, you go sell this,'"" says Mike Bell, vice president and general manager of Intel's mobile and communications group. ""We really worked with Orange to incorporate their services and the various offerings they make."" The announcement is one of many pegged to the Mobile World Congress, an annual event for the wireless industry that runs Monday through Thursday in Barcelona. Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini is hosting a news conference Monday, and other chip makers also have been disclosing new developments. Nvidia Corp., a relatively new entrant in mobile chips, is using the event known as MWC to talk up an ARM-based chip called Tegra 3. It has four main calculating engines plus a smaller extra processor for less-demanding tasks, which helps save power when a device is in standby mode. Taiwan's HTC Corp. is announcing a flagship phone at the conference called the HTC One X that uses the Tegra 3. Qualcomm Inc., whose chips are already widely used in smartphones, argues that its latest dual-processor Snapdragon model is still a performance leader. The San Diego-based company on Thursday announced plans to use a faster version of the short-range wireless technology Wi-Fi that is known by the designation 802.11ac. Orange, meanwhile, says it doubled the number of handsets carrying its own brand in 2011, and expects them to reach 20% of its portfolio this year. The company isn't yet disclosing the formal name or price of the Intel-powered model—code-named ""Orange Santa Clara,"" in an apparent reference to Intel's hometown—but says the pricing will be at an ""affordable"" level. ""With Intel we have the price positioning that will allow us to address more than 60% of our customer base,"" said Yves Maitre, Orange's senior vice president of mobile multimedia and devices. ""It really is in the middle range in terms of price, but is a high-end phone in terms of features, quality and speed."" While the phone will be geared at contract customers, pay-as-you-go users also will be able to buy the device, Mr. Maitre said. Orange will continue to work with Intel in the future, Mr. Maitre said, with the goal of introducing more competition in the smartphone market. The carrier eventually plans to roll out Intel-based devices to other countries it serves, including emerging markets, Mr. Maitre said, but only after the smartphone first gains success in France and the U.K. ""Some European countries are requesting the device,"" he said, adding that colleagues from countries like Spain, Poland and Romania are ""calling me every day to say, please, we want the Intel phone."" Intel's interest in Europe is not new.

201202,UPDATE 1-HTC eyes recovery with new smartphones,"(Adds CEO comment, launch details in para 5-7) BARCELONA/TAIPEI, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan's HTC , the world's No. 5 smartphone maker, launched a new range of smartphone models on Sunday, hoping the fresh designs will help it to recover some of the lost market share. The new smartphones are crucial for HTC in a cut-throat market place -- dominated by Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc -- as lack of new, outstanding models has sent its sales sinking over the last months. The challenge for HTC, which was once the standard bearer for the market-leading Google's Android operating system, but dropped in global rankings last quarter, is to make its Android devices stand out among dozens of similar models. HTC unveiled three new models for the new HTC One range late on Sunday, ahead of start of Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. ""HTC One takes HTC to a new level,"" CEO Peter Chou said at a news conference. All new models -- One X, One S and One V -- run the latest version of Android software. HTC said 144 mobile operators -- the widest carrier support for the firm so far -- have agreed to carry HTC One range models starting from April. ""The products look competitive, but HTC executives will be looking over their shoulders nervously to see how these new devices stack up against rival Android smartphones also being announced at the show,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. The Taiwanese company said on earlier this month that it anticipated a drop in revenue of as much as 36 percent for the first quarter, well below analysts expectations. ID:nL4E8D653N] The former contract maker had a fairytale ride in 2010 and early 2011, when its shares more than tripled in the 14 months to April 2011 and sales grew four-fold in 1-1/2 years as consumers snapped up its innovative phones with their distinctive large clock numerals. But an equally rapid fall from grace saw its stock become the worst performer among global smartphone companies last year, down 42 percent.

201202,HTC Wants to Woo Back Shoppers With 'One' Series; Bits,"BARCELONA, Spain - On Sunday, HTC, the Taiwanese phone maker, unwrapped a new flagship line of phones that it hopes will help win its way back into the hearts - and wallets - of mobile phone shoppers. Peter Chou, the chief executive of the company, said on Sunday that he hoped the HTC One series would be the kind of smartphone that would make people say, ""Wow, what is that?"" when they see it in action. He said the company invested ""a lot"" to make the One a success, including developing a new version of HTC Sense, the company's Android-based interface, called Sense 4. The new software skin, called Sense 4, is anchored around a juiced-up photo experience that helps distinguish the One series from other Android-based phones. Mr. Chou said the One phones can take photos in 0.7 seconds and auto-focus in 0.2 seconds, and have improved sensors to take better pictures in low-light conditions. In addition, the HTC One phones can shoot video and take photos simultaneously. The company also teamed up with Dropbox to offer 25 gigabytes of free cloud storage for two years, or enough room to store 10,000 photographs. Mr. Chou showed off the first three phones in the HTC One series: the One X, One V, and quad-core S 'superphone.' He said that they would be available beginning in April from 140 different mobile operators around the world, the largest global push in the company's history. T-Mobile said it would carry the HTC One S. Mr. Chou said that the One series represented the latest step in the company's evolution in design and innovation. HTC has a lot riding on the success of its new products. The company has cracked under market pressures, with its sales and profits slipping in recent quarters. It has struggled to make its smartphone stand apart from the scores of other smartphones sold by rivals. * New Phones That Put Facebook Front and Center * Facebook Makes Push for Beefed-Up Mobile Sites * Android Tablets: Catching Up in 2012 * New Nokia Phone Ramps Up Resolution to 41 Megapixels * Nokia Chief Says No Plans for Merger With Microsoft The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120226e82q002ut ",NYT Blogs,26 February 2012,384 words,htc want woo back shopper one series bit,barcelona spain sunday htc taiwanese phone maker unwrapped new flagship line hope help win way back heart wallet mobile shopper peter chou chief executive company said sunday hoped htc one series kind smartphone make people wow see action invested lot success including developing version htc sense androidbased interface called software skin called anchored around juicedup photo distinguish androidbased mr autofocus improved sensor lowlight condition addition htc shoot video simultaneously also teamed dropbox offer gigabyte free cloud storage two year enough mr showed first three htc x v quadcore superphone available april different operator world largest push history tmobile carry htc mr represented latest step evolution design htc riding product cracked market pressure sale profit slipping quarter struggled smartphone stand apart smartphones sold rival facebook front facebook beefedup site android tablet catching nokia ramp resolution megapixels nokia merger microsoft york time document nytbequt
201202,True Innovation,"Correction Appended “INNOVATION is what America has always been about,” President Obama remarked in his recent State of the Union address. It’s hard to disagree, isn’t it? We live in a world dominated by innovative American companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook. And even in the face of a recession, Silicon Valley’s relentless entrepreneurs have continued to churn out start-up companies with outsize, world-changing ambitions. But we idealize America’s present culture of innovation too much. In fact, our trailblazing digital firms may not be the hothouse environments for creativity we might think. I find myself arriving at these doubts after spending five years looking at the innovative process at Bell Labs, the onetime research and development organization of the country’s formerly monopolistic telephone company, AT&T. Why study Bell Labs? It offers a number of lessons about how our country’s technology companies — and our country’s longstanding innovative edge — actually came about. Yet Bell Labs also presents a more encompassing and ambitious approach to innovation than what prevails today. Its staff worked on the incremental improvements necessary for a complex national communications network while simultaneously thinking far ahead, toward the most revolutionary inventions imaginable. Indeed, in the search for innovative models to address seemingly intractable problems like climate change, we would do well to consider Bell Labs’ example — an effort that rivals the Apollo program and the Manhattan Project in size, scope and expense. Its mission, and its great triumph, was to connect all of us, and all of our new machines, together. In his recent letter to potential shareholders of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg noted that one of his firm’s mottoes was “move fast and break things.” Bell Labs’ might just as well have been “move deliberately and build things.” This sounds like the quaint pursuit of men who carried around slide rules and went to bed by 10 o’clock. But it was not. Consider what Bell Labs achieved. For a long stretch of the 20th century, it was the most innovative scientific organization in the world. On any list of its inventions, the most notable is probably the transistor, invented in 1947, which is now the building block of all digital products and contemporary life. These tiny devices can accomplish a multitude of tasks. The most basic is the amplification of an electric signal. But with small bursts of electricity, transistors can be switched on and off, and effectively be made to represent a “bit” of information, which is digitally expressed as a 1 or 0. Billions of transistors now reside on the chips that power our phones and computers. Bell Labs produced a startling array of other innovations, too. The silicon solar cell, the precursor of all solar-powered devices, was invented there. Two of its researchers were awarded the first patent for a laser, and colleagues built a host of early prototypes. (Every DVD player has a laser, about the size of a grain of rice, akin to the kind invented at Bell Labs.) Bell Labs created and developed the first communications satellites; the theory and development of digital communications; and the first cellular telephone systems. What’s known as the charge-coupled device, or CCD, was created there and now forms the basis for digital photography. Bell Labs also built the first fiber optic cable systems and subsequently created inventions to enable gigabytes of data to zip around the globe. It was no slouch in programming, either. Its computer scientists developed Unix and C, which form the basis for today’s most essential operating systems and computer languages. And these are just a few of the practical technologies. Some Bell Labs researchers composed papers that significantly extended the boundaries of physics, chemistry, astronomy and mathematics. Other Bell Labs engineers focused on creating extraordinary new processes (rather than new products) for Ma Bell’s industrial plants. In fact, “quality control” — the statistical analysis now used around the world as a method to ensure high-quality manufactured products — was first applied by Bell Labs mathematicians. So how can we explain how one relatively small group of scientists and engineers, working at Bell Labs in New Jersey over a relatively short span of time, came out with such an astonishing cluster of new technologies and ideas? They invented the future, which is what we now happen to call the present. And it was not by chance or serendipity. They knew something. But what? At Bell Labs, the man most responsible for the culture of creativity was Mervin Kelly. Probably Mr. Kelly’s name does not ring a bell. Born in rural Missouri to a working-class family and then educated as a physicist at the University of Chicago, he went on to join the research corps at AT&T. Between 1925 and 1959, Mr. Kelly was employed at Bell Labs, rising from researcher to chairman of the board. In 1950, he traveled around Europe, delivering a presentation that explained to audiences how his laboratory worked. His fundamental belief was that an “institute of creative technology” like his own needed a “critical mass” of talented people to foster a busy exchange of ideas. But innovation required much more than that. Mr. Kelly was convinced that physical proximity was everything; phone calls alone wouldn’t do. Quite intentionally, Bell Labs housed thinkers and doers under one roof. Purposefully mixed together on the transistor project were physicists, metallurgists and electrical engineers; side by side were specialists in theory, experimentation and manufacturing. Like an able concert hall conductor, he sought a harmony, and sometimes a tension, between scientific disciplines; between researchers and developers; and between soloists and groups. ONE element of his approach was architectural. He personally helped design a building in Murray Hill, N.J., opened in 1941, where everyone would interact with one another. Some of the hallways in the building were designed to be so long that to look down their length was to see the end disappear at a vanishing point. Traveling the hall’s length without encountering a number of acquaintances, problems, diversions and ideas was almost impossible. A physicist on his way to lunch in the cafeteria was like a magnet rolling past iron filings. Another element of the approach was aspirational. Bell Labs was sometimes caricatured as an ivory tower. But it is more aptly described as an ivory tower with a factory downstairs. It was clear to the researchers and engineers there that the ultimate aim of their organization was to transform new knowledge into new things. Steven Chu, secretary of the Department of Energy, won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. He once said that working in an environment of applied science like Bell Labs “doesn’t destroy a kernel of genius, it focuses the mind.” At Bell Labs, even for researchers in pursuit of pure scientific understanding, it was obvious that their work could be used. Still another method Mr. Kelly used to push ahead was organizational. He set up Bell Labs’ satellite facilities in the phone company’s manufacturing plants, so as to help transfer all these new ideas into things. But the exchange was supposed to go both ways, with the engineers learning from the plant workers, too. As manufacturing has increasingly moved out of the United States in the past half century, it has likewise taken with it a whole ecosystem of industrial knowledge. But in the past, this knowledge tended to push Bell Labs toward new innovations. Mr. Kelly believed that freedom was crucial, especially in research. Some of his scientists had so much autonomy that he was mostly unaware of their progress until years after he authorized their work. When he set up the team of researchers to work on what became the transistor, for instance, more than two years passed before the invention occurred. Afterward, when he set up another team to handle the invention’s mass manufacture, he dropped the assignment into the lap of an engineer and instructed him to come up with a plan. He told the engineer he was going to Europe in the meantime. In sum, he trusted people to create. And he trusted them to help one another create. To him, having at Bell Labs a number of scientific exemplars — “the guy who wrote the book,” as these standouts were often called, because they had in fact written the definitive book on a subject — was necessary. But so was putting them into the everyday mix. In an era before cubicles, all employees at Bell Labs were instructed to work with their doors open. Saddled with a difficult problem, a new hire there, an anxious nobody, was regularly directed by a supervisor toward the guy who wrote the book. Some young employees would quake when they were told to ask a question of famous mathematicians like Claude Shannon or legendary physicists like William Shockley. Still, Bell Labs’ policy was not to turn them away. THERE was another element necessary to Mervin Kelly’s innovation strategy, an element as crucial, or more crucial even, than all the others. Mr. Kelly talked fast and walked fast; he ran up and down staircases. But he gave his researchers not only freedom but also time. Lots of time — years to pursue what they felt was essential. One might see this as impossible in today’s faster, more competitive world. Or one might contend it is irrelevant because Bell Labs (unlike today’s technology companies) had the luxury of serving a parent organization that had a large and dependable income ensured by its monopoly status. Nobody had to meet benchmarks to help with quarterly earnings; nobody had to rush a product to market before the competition did. But what should our pursuit of innovation actually accomplish? By one definition, innovation is an important new product or process, deployed on a large scale and having a significant impact on society and the economy, that can do a job (as Mr. Kelly once put it) “better, or cheaper, or both.” Regrettably, we now use the term to describe almost anything. It can describe a smartphone app or a social media tool; or it can describe the transistor or the blueprint for a cellphone system. The differences are immense. One type of innovation creates a handful of jobs and modest revenues; another, the type Mr. Kelly and his colleagues at Bell Labs repeatedly sought, creates millions of jobs and a long-lasting platform for society’s wealth and well-being. The conflation of these different kinds of innovations seems to be leading us toward a belief that small groups of profit-seeking entrepreneurs turning out innovative consumer products are as effective as our innovative forebears. History does not support this belief. The teams at Bell Labs that invented the laser, transistor and solar cell were not seeking profits. They were seeking understanding. Yet in the process they created not only new products but entirely new — and lucrative — industries. There’s no single best way to innovate. Silicon Valley’s methods have benefited our country well over the course of several decades. And it would be absurd to return to an era of big monopolies. Today’s telecom industries are thriving, and customers likewise have access to a dazzling range of affordable devices and services, which most likely would not have been true had the old phone company remained intact. Though it had custody of the world’s most innovative labs, AT&T introduced new products and services slowly, and rarely cheaply. As Time magazine once put it, “Few companies are more conservative; none are more creative.” But to consider the legacy of Bell Labs is to see that we should not mistake small technological steps for huge technological leaps. It also shows us that to always “move fast and break things,” as Facebook is apparently doing, or to constantly pursue “a gospel of speed” (as Google has described its philosophy) is not the only way to get where we are going. Perhaps it is not even the best way. Revolutions happen fast but dawn slowly. To a large extent, we’re still benefiting from risks that were taken, and research that was financed, more than a half century ago. Jon Gertner is the author of the forthcoming “The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation.” Correction: March 4, 2012, Sunday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover photograph last Sunday with an opinion essay about Bell Labs and its contributions to scientific and technological innovation was published in error. The picture, from Magnum Photos, most likely showed workers at Allied Chemical in 1967 — not at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1966. The photograph had been incorrectly labeled in the studio of the photographer, Elliott Erwitt. Also, a timeline with the essay incorrectly attributed a distinction to Bell Labs, based on information from the Web site of its corporate successor, Alcatel-Lucent. In 1933, Bell Labs gave the first demonstration of long-distance transmission of three-channel high-fidelity stereo sound — not the first transmission of stereo sound.

It also shows us that to always ''move fast and break things,'' as Facebook is apparently doing, or to constantly pursue ''a gospel of speed'' (as Google has described its philosophy) is not the only way to get where we are going. Perhaps it is not even the best way. Revolutions happen fast but dawn slowly. To a large extent, we're still benefiting from risks that were taken, and research that was financed, more than a half century ago. Correction: March 4, 2012, Sunday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover photograph last Sunday with an opinion essay about Bell Labs and its contributions to scientific and technological innovation was published in error. The picture, from Magnum Photos, most likely showed workers at Allied Chemical in 1967 -- not at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1966. The photograph had been incorrectly labeled in the studio of the photographer, Elliott Erwitt. Also, a timeline with the essay incorrectly attributed a distinction to Bell Labs, based on information from the Web site of its corporate successor, Alcatel-Lucent. In 1933, Bell Labs gave the first demonstration of long-distance transmission of three-channel high-fidelity stereo sound -- not the first transmission of stereo sound.

201202,WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Upside: Apple at $500: Is It Time to Double Down -- or Walk Away?,"With Apple shares having recently topped $500, how soon might they hit $1,000? That is an impatient thought for an investor, perhaps. But Apple shareholders have gotten used to fast gratification: The share price has doubled five times in the past decade. Although Apple already is America's largest company by stock-market value, there are several reasons to believe that it can grow much larger. But it is far from a sure thing, and prospective buyers already may have more exposure to the stock than they think if they own index funds. Apple's recent growth is the envy of most companies, large and small. Sales jumped 73% and earnings more than doubled during its quarter ended Dec. 31. By one measure, Apple stock remains reasonably priced. It sells for just under 15 times the company's earnings over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is in line with the historic average for U.S. stocks and below the current median of nearly 17 for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. ""Apple is priced like a slow grower because investors aren't used to dealing with a company this big that's growing this fast,"" says Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research in New York. Mr. Ernst, whose price targets on the stock have long been among Wall Street's highest, says Apple should be worth $700 a share today. A doubling of the stock price from Friday's $522.41 would put Apple's market value at over $900 billion. No U.S. company has ever been that large. Such a value seems plausible, however. Microsoft reached a value of around $600 billion in late 1999, which is more than $800 billion in today's dollars. It was helped by a tech-stock boom, but Apple today produces more than triple the profit that Microsoft did back then, not adjusted for inflation. Another important difference: Microsoft in late 1999 controlled more than 90% of the market for personal-computer operating systems, according to some estimates. Apple controlled 26.6% of the mobile-computing market in the fourth quarter of 2011, including notebooks and tablets, according to NPD DisplaySearch, which provides research for the display industry. Its smartphone market share was 23.9% in the fourth quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, a technology consultant. ""Apple has plenty of room to gain market share in the U.S., and even more in emerging markets like China,"" says Michael Walkley, who covers Apple for Toronto investment bank Canaccord Genuity. Mr. Ernst and Mr. Walkley both say Apple stock could hit $1,000 within three years. That would require an extraordinary return of close to 25% a year. The 50-year average for the S&P 500 is about 9% a year, not adjusted for inflation. Both analysts cite Apple's record of creating large new markets (iPods, smartphones, tablet computers) and its cash and investments of nearly $100 billion. Both also think a dividend payment could attract a new crowd of buyers to shares, especially among income-seeking mutual funds. Apple pays no dividend and hasn't announced plans to start, but Chief Executive Tim Cook told shareholders Thursday the cash is ""more than we need to run the company"" and that management is thinking ""very deeply"" about what to do with it. Only five of 57 analysts with published recommendations on Apple are neutral or negative. Colin Gillis at BGC Partners in New York, who calls the stock a ""hold,"" says that for Apple to impress investors from here it must ""smash earnings forecasts to pieces, and that's a difficult position."" Edward Zabitsky, founder of Toronto-based ACI Research, says these days he often is referred to as ""the guy who says to sell Apple,"" being the only analyst with that recommendation. ""It feels a little lonely,"" he says. In Mr. Zabitsky's view, Apple will lose its pricing power as mobile Web browsers become more powerful, because users will no longer need phones and tablets that support a large universe of specialized programs. Stock buyers should bet on mobile broadband companies like Verizon Communications and AT&T and on content owners like Walt Disney, he says. Who's right? Brian Lazorishak says he isn't sure, but a 52% run-up in the stock over the past year has left him with more exposure than he wants as a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Va., which oversees $700 million. He is selling a portion of his position. Other investors may likewise find they have more Apple exposure than they want -- or know. The stock makes up nearly 4% of the S&P 500 index, which weights companies by size. And Apple contributed about 6% of the index's fourth-quarter earnings, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. Without Apple beating Wall Street forecasts by 37% last quarter, the 500 index would be on track to fall 3% short of earnings forecasts, instead of meeting them, Mr. Silverblatt says. Investors who are determined to bet on one more doubling for Apple stock might want to content themselves with buying the Technology Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund. It tracks the tech sector of the S&P 500, in which Apple has a nearly one-fifth weighting. But it also has plenty of exposure to companies like International Business Machines, Google, Microsoft and AT&T, just in case Apple stumbles. After all, giants like Apple face long odds. Between 1952 and 2009, shares of the largest companies in their sectors by market value each year tended to underperform peers over the following decade by more than three percentage points a year, according to Robert Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates, a Newport Beach, Calif., money manager. Apple has recently shown a knack for beating such odds. But most stock investors probably already have enough of a stake in the company's success, whether they hold individual shares or not. --- Jack Hough is a columnist at SmartMoney.com.

201202,Confronting a Law Of Limits,"These days, it's hard to find a superlative that adequately describes Apple. But maybe simplest is best: biggest. Measured by market capitalization, Apple is the world's biggest public company. This week it solidified its lead over Exxon Mobil, the previous titleholder, as Apple's shares hit a record high of $526.29, which gave it a market capitalization of just under $500 billion. Apple becomes only the 11th company to reach the top spot since 1926, according Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's. Apple's first-quarter earnings of more than $13 billion accounted for more than 6 percent of all earnings for the S.& P. 500, according to Mr. Silverblatt. Sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 included an astonishing 37.04 million iPhones and 15.43 million iPads and totaled $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from the year before. Earnings more than doubled. Compare that with this week's earning from the tech giants Hewlett-Packard (down 44 percent) and Dell (down 18 percent). Apple shares have surged 68 percent from their low point in June, and it's not just Apple shareholders who have benefited. Apple is now such a large part of the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes that it has buoyed millions of investors who own shares of broad index funds and mutual funds. These investors account for an estimated half of the American population. This week the Nasdaq composite reached its highest level since 2000 and the S.& P. 500 hit levels not seen since before the financial crisis. Here is the rub: Apple is so big, it's running up against the law of large numbers. Also known as the golden theorem, with a proof attributed to the 17th-century Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the law states that a variable will revert to a mean over a large sample of results. In the case of the largest companies, it suggests that high earnings growth and a rapid rise in share price will slow as those companies grow ever larger. If Apple's share price grew even 20 percent a year for the next decade, which is far below its current blistering pace, its $500 billion market capitalization would be more than $3 trillion by 2022. That is bigger than the 2011 gross domestic product of France or Brazil. Put another way, to increase its revenue by 20 percent, Apple has to generate additional sales of more than $9 billion in its next fourth quarter. A company with $1 billion in sales has to come up with just another $200 million. Robert Cihra, an analyst who covers Apple at Evercore Partners, told me this week that the law of large numbers as it applied to Apple had ''been a concern for years now.'' But, he said, ''over the past couple of years, they have actually accelerated revenue growth. I don't know that can continue indefinitely. If you extrapolate far enough out into the future, to sustain that growth Apple would have to sell an iPhone to every man, woman, child, animal and rock on the planet.'' The law of large numbers may explain why, even at its recent lofty stock price, Apple looks like a bargain by most measures. The ratio of its share price to its earnings, a common measure of a company's stock value, is less than 11 based on earnings projections for this year. That is well below the market's average P/E ratio of about 13. Apple shares are even being bought by so-called value investors, who are usually confined to stodgier, low-growth but arguably undervalued companies. ''The valuation on Apple stock right now is unjustifiably low,'' Mr. Cihra said. ''If it weren't so big, the P/E multiple would be a lot higher. They almost doubled their earnings in calendar year 2011 and yet the stock is trading currently at a P/E multiple of less than 11. It's trading way below the market average, even though it's growing way above the market average. The multiple is being compressed simply because investors are asking how it can get bigger.'' There may be sobering reasons for that. Other companies that have reached the top appear to have been felled by Bernoulli's law. Cisco Systems held the top position and hit a market capitalization of $557 billion -- larger than Apple's -- in March 2000, at the peak of the technology bubble. Its market capitalization today is about $100 billion, and shares are down nearly 80 percent since March 2000. In contrast with Apple, Cisco's market value and sky-high 120 P/E ratio were inflated by investor euphoria rather than actual results. But other titleholders have met a similarly disappointing fate, although far less drastic. Exxon Mobil, recently displaced by Apple as the biggest company by market value, took over the top spot in 2006, seven years after the merger of Exxon and Mobil. At the end of that year, its market capitalization was $447 billion. Today it's $35 billion lower. General Electric held the title for a number of years, most recently in 2005, when its market capitalization was $370 billion. Today, it's just $205 billion. Microsoft was No. 1 in 2002 with a market capitalization of $276 billion. Today, it's $262 billion. Of recent titleholders, the only one that has gained is I.B.M., whose market capitalization of $65 billion ranked first in 1990. Today, it's $229 billion. Over the intervening 22 years, that is a compound rate of return of 11.2 percent including dividends -- impressive but hardly the growth rate Apple shareholders have come to expect. Over the same period, an S.& P. 500 index fund returned 8.7 percent. Can Apple escape a similar fate? After never being a dominant force in personal computers, Apple surged to the top of the S.& P. 500 by transforming the cellphone into a multitasking smartphone, arguably the single most important technological advance so far in the 21st century. It rolled over vaunted rivals like Nokia, Motorola and Research in Motion with a combination of brilliant technology, dazzling design and shrewd marketing backed by the singular vision of its late founder, Steve Jobs. ''Everyone truly needs it,'' Mr. Cihra said of the smartphone. ''It's the most transformative piece of technology in our lifetimes.'' Notwithstanding Apple's huge size, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the company's prospects. Of 57 analysts who cover the company, 52 have a strong buy or buy recommendation. Only one recommends selling: Edward Zabitsky, the chief executive and founder of ACI Research in Toronto, who specializes in telecommunications and has been Apple's reigning Cassandra for years. He's a favorite target of the Web's ''iPhone death watch,'' which features negative (and thus far wrong) projections about Apple. ''In all my years as an analyst, I've never gotten the kind of attention I've gotten from my Apple call,'' Mr. Zabitsky told me this week. ''I've gotten e-mails from everyone from radiologists to car repair people from all over North America telling me I'm a fool. We're just a research operation, so we're not trying to get any business from Apple. If we were, I doubt we'd get any.'' ''Apple has created a tremendous ecosystem where there was none,'' Mr. Zabitsky acknowledges. But he says he thinks competition will erode Apple's advantages as computing shifts to the cloud. ''The question isn't whether this will happen, but why and when. The company that understands this best is Microsoft. They're betting the farm on Web apps. They'll be competing with Apple on every product. Microsoft is big enough and motivated enough to make this happen.'' But Mr. Zabitsky remains a solitary voice. ''The reason Apple has been able to continue growing at a spectacular rate, even as its revenue base has surpassed $100 billion, is because it targets the world's biggest markets,'' Mr. Cihra said. He rates the stock a buy and projects revenue for calendar year 2012 at $165 billion. ''The simple fact is that they still have a small share of huge markets -- single-digit shares in both PCs and mobile phones.'' Global mobile phone subscriptions neared six billion in 2011, with Apple's share of the handset market at 5.6 percent, according to the market intelligence firm IDC. ''There's no mathematical reason Apple can't keep growing at a premium rate for at least several more years,'' Mr. Cihra said. ''At the end of the day, there's no good reason for market cap to be a ceiling.'' Apple fans are eagerly awaiting Apple's next big thing. A voice-activated television that upends TV the way Apple transformed music and cellphones? Maybe. And Mr. Cihra may well be right that Apple investors have at least several years of breathing room. But history suggests that excessive enthusiasm can often precede a fall. At Cisco's peak, every Wall Street analyst covering the company rated it a strong buy or buy. ''Cisco continues to execute very well and demonstrates that it is in a class by itself,'' Seth Spalding, an analyst at Epoch Partners, wrote, joining a chorus of analysts praising Cisco's latest earnings -- in November 2000.

201202,Caution Sets In as Indexes Hit Feel-Good Heights,"As summer approached in 2008, oil prices were surging, the housing market was collapsing and banks were bleeding money. Soon, Lehman Brothers would collapse and shock the financial system, sending stocks plunging. Investors dug out of that hole this week. The broad market gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, closed Friday at its highest level since June 2008. The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average briefly cracked the psychological barrier of 13,000, last surpassed in spring 2008, but didn't manage to end the session above that. ''We have come a long way,'' said Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ''But the overall economy is clearly not back to normal yet.'' ''It does not mean the economy is out of the woods,'' he added. ''It means that we have had almost four years where if you held on in the stock market through the period, you would be back where you started.'' The gains so far this year have pushed the S.& P. 500 nearly 25 percent higher than its most recent lowest point, on Oct. 3, 2011. The index has risen more than 100 percent since the March 9, 2009, low of 676.53. Its close at 1,365.74 on Friday is still well off its record high of 1,565.15 on October 2007. Over time, a tug of war has ensued below the surface of the index. From June 2008 until Friday, consumer discretionary and technology stocks have been the top two gainers, surging more than 32 percent and 19 percent, while financial stocks have declined the most, falling more than 40 percent. The technology sector has held strong since 2008 because of a cycle of ''replacement technology,'' with consumers switching from feature phones to smartphones, and from computers to tablets, said Michael Gartenberg, a research director at Gartner. ''The timing was right for consumers to embrace the technology, and the technology was ready for consumers to be embraced,'' he said. Apple, the world's biggest company by market capitalization, fueled the ascent. The growth rate of the S.& P. 500 for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 5.9 percent compared with the quarter a year ago, and if Apple were removed from the equation, that number would drop to 2.8 percent, said John Butters, an earnings analyst at FactSet Research. Apple, which closed Friday at $522.41, is up 176 percent since June 2008. Along with weak capital markets, the big banks are still suffering from the aftereffects of issuing millions of new shares to build stronger capital buffers after the bankruptcy of Lehman in September 2008. While the banks, hobbled by toxic real estate loans and failed derivatives, succeeded in raising capital quickly and avoiding even deeper problems, those new shares diluted existing stock holdings. ''It took the Japanese banks years to recapitalize,'' said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief equity strategist. ''The U.S. did it very rapidly and there was massive dilution as a lot of stocks got decimated.'' Bank of America, for example, traded at more than $35 a share as late as mid-2008. On Friday, it closed at $7.88, a huge drop from nearly four years ago, but still well above its low point just below $5 late last year. Since bottoming out in October, financial stocks have risen some 30 percent. The rally has been sharp in part because the sell-off was so extreme, Mr. Levkovich said. ''A lot of the worst performers in 2011 have been among the best performers in 2012,'' he said. ''The harder they fall, the bigger they bounce.'' Some analysts who have watched previous boom-and-bust cycles in the financial sector insist the group remains appealing, despite the recent jump. ''I think they are very, very undervalued,'' said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. ''People are reflexively antibank. The reality is that banking isn't like Eastman Kodak or Polaroid -- five years from now, people will interact with banks pretty much the same way they did five years ago. The need for the underlying service hasn't changed.'' While Friday brought some upbeat reports on consumer sentiment and new-home sales, the markets appeared leery of escalating oil and gasoline prices, as well as tensions with Iran and the unfinished bailout for Greece. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 12,982.95 on Friday, down 1.74 points. That the index temporarily breached the 13,000 ceiling this week was ''certainly a statistical milestone,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''But not one worthy of uncorking Champagne bottles and having a celebration.'' The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.77 points, to 2,963.75. All three indexes were up less than 1 percent for the week. The April crude oil contract jumped $1.94, to $109.77 a barrel. Interest rates were slightly lower on Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 100 7/32, and the yield fell to 1.98 percent from 2 percent Thursday. Analysts noted that over the years, surges in the stock market did not often run on parallel tracks with the economy. In the summer of 2008, the economy was months into recession, but some days the equities markets posted strong gains. In early August, the Dow surged more than 200 points in one trading session even as corporate profits were falling, layoffs were rising and economists were warning that the outlook for the year looked grim. ''There is a separation between the United States economy and stock prices,'' said Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial. He said in 2008, a lot of the market momentum came from sales growth overseas in emerging markets, and a weaker dollar that helped profits. In 2010 and 2011, there were also gains in the early parts of the years before the markets tapered off. This was especially true last year, when the earthquake in Japan severed supply chains and oil prices surged. Stocks sank in the second half of the year because of increasing concerns over Europe's sovereign debt problems and the United States budget deficit. ''Domestically, this is the third time we are gaining momentum in this recovery,'' said Mr. Price. George M. Feiger, the chief executive of Contango Capital Advisors, said much of the market's buoyancy was ''artificial,'' because companies were showing better earnings from cost-cutting and the banking system had been repaired through bailouts. ''Our best guess is that we might see a pattern like last year,'' he said. ''The things that brought it down in the second half, they are as bad today.

201202,S.&P. 500 at Highest Close Since ’08,"As summer approached in 2008, oil prices were surging, the housing market was collapsing and banks were bleeding money. Soon, Lehman Brothers would collapse and shock the financial system, sending stocks plunging. Investors dug out of that hole this week. The broad market gauge, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, closed Friday at its highest level since June 2008. The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average briefly cracked the psychological barrier of 13,000, last surpassed in spring 2008, but didn’t manage to end the session above that. “We have come a long way,” said Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. “But the overall economy is clearly not back to normal yet.”  “It does not mean the economy is out of the woods,” he added. “It means that we have had almost four years where if you held on in the stock market through the period, you would be back where you started.” The gains so far this year have pushed the S.& P. 500 nearly 25 percent higher than its most recent lowest point, on Oct. 3, 2011. The index has risen more than 100 percent since the March 9, 2009, low of 676.53. Its close at 1,365.74 on Friday is still well off its record high of 1,565.15 on October 2007. Over time, a tug of war has ensued below the surface of the index. From June 2008 until Friday, consumer discretionary and technology stocks have been the top two gainers, surging more than 32 percent and 19 percent, while financial stocks have declined the most, falling more than 40 percent. The technology sector has held strong since 2008 because of a cycle of “replacement technology,” with consumers switching from feature phones to smartphones, and from computers to tablets, said Michael Gartenberg, a research director at Gartner. “The timing was right for consumers to embrace the technology, and the technology was ready for consumers to be embraced,” he said. Apple, the world’s biggest company by market capitalization, fueled the ascent. The growth rate of the S.& P. 500 for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 5.9 percent compared with the quarter a year ago, and if Apple were removed from the equation, that number would drop to 2.8 percent, said John Butters, an earnings analyst at FactSet Research. Apple, which closed Friday at $522.41, is up 176 percent since June 2008. Along with weak capital markets, the big banks are still suffering from the aftereffects of issuing millions of new shares to build stronger capital buffers after the bankruptcy of Lehman in September 2008. While the banks, hobbled by toxic real estate loans and failed derivatives, succeeded in raising capital quickly and avoiding even deeper problems, those new shares diluted existing stock holdings. “It took the Japanese banks years to recapitalize,” said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup’s chief equity strategist. “The U.S. did it very rapidly and there was massive dilution as a lot of stocks got decimated.” Bank of America, for example, traded at more than $35 a share as late as mid-2008. On Friday, it closed at $7.88, a huge drop from nearly four years ago, but still well above its low point just below $5 late last year.  Since bottoming out in October, financial stocks have risen some 30 percent. The rally has been sharp in part because the sell-off was so extreme, Mr. Levkovich said. “A lot of the worst performers in 2011 have been among the best performers in 2012,” he said. “The harder they fall, the bigger they bounce.” Some analysts who have watched previous boom-and-bust cycles in the financial sector insist the group remains appealing, despite the recent jump. “I think they are very, very undervalued,” said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. “People are reflexively antibank. The reality is that banking isn’t like Eastman Kodak or Polaroid — five years from now, people will interact with banks pretty much the same way they did five years ago. The need for the underlying service hasn’t changed.” While Friday brought some upbeat reports on consumer sentiment and new-home sales, the markets appeared leery of escalating oil and gasoline prices, as well as tensions with Iran and the unfinished bailout for Greece. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 12,982.95 on Friday, down 1.74 points. That the index temporarily breached the 13,000 ceiling this week was “certainly a statistical milestone,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. “But not one worthy of uncorking Champagne bottles and having a celebration.” The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.77 points, to 2,963.75. All three indexes were up less than 1 percent for the week. The April crude oil contract jumped $1.94, to $109.77 a barrel. Interest rates were slightly lower on Friday. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 100 7/32, and the yield fell to 1.98 percent from 2 percent Thursday. Analysts noted that over the years, surges in the stock market did not often run on parallel tracks with the economy. In the summer of 2008, the economy was months into recession, but some days the equities markets posted strong gains. In early August, the Dow surged more than 200 points in one trading session even as corporate profits were falling, layoffs were rising and economists were warning that the outlook for the year looked grim. “There is a separation between the United States economy and stock prices,” said Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial. He said in 2008, a lot of the market momentum came from sales growth overseas in emerging markets, and a weaker dollar that helped profits. In 2010 and 2011, there were also gains in the early parts of the years before the markets tapered off. This was especially true last year, when the earthquake in Japan severed supply chains and oil prices surged. Stocks sank in the second half of the year because of increasing concerns over Europe’s sovereign debt problems and the United States budget deficit. “Domestically, this is the third time we are gaining momentum in this recovery,” said Mr. Price. George M. Feiger, the chief executive of Contango Capital Advisors, said much of the market’s buoyancy was “artificial,” because companies were showing better earnings from cost-cutting and the banking system had been repaired through bailouts. “Our best guess is that we might see a pattern like last year,” he said. “The things that brought it down in the second half, they are as bad today. I would say nothing fundamentally has changed.” Brian X. Chen and Nelson Schwartz contributed reporting.

201202,Confronting a Law Of Limits,"These days, it’s hard to find a superlative that adequately describes Apple. But maybe simplest is best: biggest. Measured by market capitalization, Apple is the world’s biggest public company. This week it solidified its lead over Exxon Mobil, the previous titleholder, as Apple’s shares hit a record high of $526.29, which gave it a market capitalization of just under $500 billion. Apple becomes only the 11th company to reach the top spot since 1926, according Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for Standard & Poor’s. Apple’s first-quarter earnings of more than $13 billion accounted for more than 6 percent of all earnings for the S.& P. 500, according to Mr. Silverblatt. Sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 included an astonishing 37.04 million iPhones and 15.43 million iPads and totaled $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from the year before. Earnings more than doubled. Compare that with this week’s earning from the tech giants Hewlett-Packard (down 44 percent) and Dell (down 18 percent). Apple shares have surged 68 percent from their low point in June, and it’s not just Apple shareholders who have benefited. Apple is now such a large part of the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes that it has buoyed millions of investors who own shares of broad index funds and mutual funds. These investors account for an estimated half of the American population. This week the Nasdaq composite reached its highest level since 2000 and the S.& P. 500 hit levels not seen since before the financial crisis. Here is the rub: Apple is so big, it’s running up against the law of large numbers. Also known as the golden theorem, with a proof attributed to the 17th-century Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the law states that a variable will revert to a mean over a large sample of results. In the case of the largest companies, it suggests that high earnings growth and a rapid rise in share price will slow as those companies grow ever larger. If Apple’s share price grew even 20 percent a year for the next decade, which is far below its current blistering pace, its $500 billion market capitalization would be more than $3 trillion by 2022. That is bigger than the 2011 gross domestic product of France or Brazil. Put another way, to increase its revenue by 20 percent, Apple has to generate additional sales of more than $9 billion in its next fourth quarter. A company with $1 billion in sales has to come up with just another $200 million. Robert Cihra, an analyst who covers Apple at Evercore Partners, told me this week that the law of large numbers as it applied to Apple had “been a concern for years now.” But, he said, “over the past couple of years, they have actually accelerated revenue growth. I don’t know that can continue indefinitely. If you extrapolate far enough out into the future, to sustain that growth Apple would have to sell an iPhone to every man, woman, child, animal and rock on the planet.” The law of large numbers may explain why, even at its recent lofty stock price, Apple looks like a bargain by most measures. The ratio of its share price to its earnings, a common measure of a company’s stock value, is less than 11 based on earnings projections for this year. That is well below the market’s average P/E ratio of about 13. Apple shares are even being bought by so-called value investors, who are usually confined to stodgier, low-growth but arguably undervalued companies. “The valuation on Apple stock right now is unjustifiably low,” Mr. Cihra said. “If it weren’t so big, the P/E multiple would be a lot higher. They almost doubled their earnings in calendar year 2011 and yet the stock is trading currently at a P/E multiple of less than 11. It’s trading way below the market average, even though it’s growing way above the market average. The multiple is being compressed simply because investors are asking how it can get bigger.” There may be sobering reasons for that. Other companies that have reached the top appear to have been felled by Bernoulli’s law. Cisco Systems held the top position and hit a market capitalization of $557 billion — larger than Apple’s — in March 2000, at the peak of the technology bubble. Its market capitalization today is about $100 billion, and shares are down nearly 80 percent since March 2000. In contrast with Apple, Cisco’s market value and sky-high 120 P/E ratio were inflated by investor euphoria rather than actual results. But other titleholders have met a similarly disappointing fate, although far less drastic. Exxon Mobil, recently displaced by Apple as the biggest company by market value, took over the top spot in 2006, seven years after the merger of Exxon and Mobil. At the end of that year, its market capitalization was $447 billion. Today it’s $35 billion lower. General Electric held the title for a number of years, most recently in 2005, when its market capitalization was $370 billion. Today, it’s just $205 billion. Microsoft was No. 1 in 2002 with a market capitalization of $276 billion. Today, it’s $262 billion. Of recent titleholders, the only one that has gained is I.B.M., whose market capitalization of $65 billion ranked first in 1990. Today, it’s $229 billion. Over the intervening 22 years, that is a compound rate of return of 11.2 percent including dividends — impressive but hardly the growth rate Apple shareholders have come to expect. Over the same period, an S.& P. 500 index fund returned 8.7 percent. Can Apple escape a similar fate? After never being a dominant force in personal computers, Apple surged to the top of the S.& P. 500 by transforming the cellphone into a multitasking smartphone, arguably the single most important technological advance so far in the 21st century. It rolled over vaunted rivals like Nokia, Motorola and Research in Motion with a combination of brilliant technology, dazzling design and shrewd marketing backed by the singular vision of its late founder, Steve Jobs. “Everyone truly needs it,” Mr. Cihra said of the smartphone. “It’s the most transformative piece of technology in our lifetimes.” Notwithstanding Apple’s huge size, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the company’s prospects. Of 57 analysts who cover the company, 52 have a strong buy or buy recommendation. Only one recommends selling: Edward Zabitsky, the chief executive and founder of ACI Research in Toronto, who specializes in telecommunications and has been Apple’s reigning Cassandra for years. He’s a favorite target of the Web’s “iPhone death watch,” which features negative (and thus far wrong) projections about Apple. “In all my years as an analyst, I’ve never gotten the kind of attention I’ve gotten from my Apple call,” Mr. Zabitsky told me this week. “I’ve gotten e-mails from everyone from radiologists to car repair people from all over North America telling me I’m a fool. We’re just a research operation, so we’re not trying to get any business from Apple. If we were, I doubt we’d get any.” “Apple has created a tremendous ecosystem where there was none,” Mr. Zabitsky acknowledges. But he says he thinks competition will erode Apple’s advantages as computing shifts to the cloud. “The question isn’t whether this will happen, but why and when. The company that understands this best is Microsoft. They’re betting the farm on Web apps. They’ll be competing with Apple on every product. Microsoft is big enough and motivated enough to make this happen.” But Mr. Zabitsky remains a solitary voice. “The reason Apple has been able to continue growing at a spectacular rate, even as its revenue base has surpassed $100 billion, is because it targets the world’s biggest markets,” Mr. Cihra said. He rates the stock a buy and projects revenue for calendar year 2012 at $165 billion. “The simple fact is that they still have a small share of huge markets — single-digit shares in both PCs and mobile phones.” Global mobile phone subscriptions neared six billion in 2011, with Apple’s share of the handset market at 5.6 percent, according to the market intelligence firm IDC. “There’s no mathematical reason Apple can’t keep growing at a premium rate for at least several more years,” Mr. Cihra said. “At the end of the day, there’s no good reason for market cap to be a ceiling.” Apple fans are eagerly awaiting Apple’s next big thing. A voice-activated television that upends TV the way Apple transformed music and cellphones? Maybe. And Mr. Cihra may well be right that Apple investors have at least several years of breathing room. But history suggests that excessive enthusiasm can often precede a fall. At Cisco’s peak, every Wall Street analyst covering the company rated it a strong buy or buy. “Cisco continues to execute very well and demonstrates that it is in a class by itself,” Seth Spalding, an analyst at Epoch Partners, wrote, joining a chorus of analysts praising Cisco’s latest earnings — in November 2000.

201202,Apple at $500: Is It Time to Double Down—or Walk Away?,"With Apple shares having recently topped $500, how soon might they hit $1,000? That is an impatient thought for an investor, perhaps. But Apple shareholders have gotten used to fast gratification: The share price has doubled five times in the past decade. Although Apple already is America's largest company by stock-market value, there are several reasons to believe that it can grow much larger. But it is far from a sure thing, and prospective buyers already may have more exposure to the stock than they think if they own index funds. Apple's recent growth is the envy of most companies, large and small. Sales jumped 73% and earnings more than doubled during its quarter ended Dec. 31. By one measure, Apple stock remains reasonably priced. It sells for just under 15 times the company's earnings over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is in line with the historic average for U.S. stocks and below the current median of nearly 17 for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. ""Apple is priced like a slow grower because investors aren't used to dealing with a company this big that's growing this fast,"" says Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research in New York. Mr. Ernst, whose price targets on the stock have long been among Wall Street's highest, says Apple should be worth $700 a share today. A doubling of the stock price from Friday's $522.41 would put Apple's market value at over $900 billion. No U.S. company has ever been that large. Such a value seems plausible, however. Microsoft reached a value of around $600 billion in late 1999, which is more than $800 billion in today's dollars. It was helped by a tech-stock boom, but Apple today produces more than triple the profit that Microsoft did back then, not adjusted for inflation. Gaining Market Share Another important difference: Microsoft in late 1999 controlled more than 90% of the market for personal-computer operating systems, according to some estimates. Apple controlled 26.6% of the mobile-computing market in the fourth quarter of 2011, including notebooks and tablets, according to NPD DisplaySearch, which provides research for the display industry. Its smartphone market share was 23.9% in the fourth quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, a technology consultant. ""Apple has plenty of room to gain market share in the U.S., and even more in emerging markets like China,"" says Michael Walkley, who covers Apple for Toronto investment bank Canaccord Genuity. Mr. Ernst and Mr. Walkley both say Apple stock could hit $1,000 within three years. That would require an extraordinary return of close to 25% a year. The 50-year average for the S&P 500 is about 9% a year, not adjusted for inflation. Both analysts cite Apple's record of creating large new markets (iPods, smartphones, tablet computers) and its cash and investments of nearly $100 billion. Both also think a dividend payment could attract a new crowd of buyers to shares, especially among income-seeking mutual funds. Apple pays no dividend and hasn't announced plans to start, but Chief Executive Tim Cook told shareholders Thursday the cash is ""more than we need to run the company"" and that management is thinking ""very deeply"" about what to do with it. Only five of 57 analysts with published recommendations on Apple are neutral or negative. Colin Gillis at BGC Partners in New York, who calls the stock a ""hold,"" says that for Apple to impress investors from here it must ""smash earnings forecasts to pieces, and that's a difficult position."" Edward Zabitsky, founder of Toronto-based ACI Research, says these days he often is referred to as ""the guy who says to sell Apple,"" being the only analyst with that recommendation. ""It feels a little lonely,"" he says. Betting on Mobile Broadband In Mr. Zabitsky's view, Apple will lose its pricing power as mobile Web browsers become more powerful, because users will no longer need phones and tablets that support a large universe of specialized programs. Stock buyers should bet on mobile broadband companies like Verizon Communications and AT&T and on content owners like Walt Disney, he says. Who's right? Brian Lazorishak says he isn't sure, but a 52% run-up in the stock over the past year has left him with more exposure than he wants as a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Va., which oversees $700 million. He is selling a portion of his position. Other investors may likewise find they have more Apple exposure than they want—or know. The stock makes up nearly 4% of the S&P 500 index, which weights companies by size. And Apple contributed about 6% of the index's fourth-quarter earnings, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. Without Apple beating Wall Street forecasts by 37% last quarter, the 500 index would be on track to fall 3% short of earnings forecasts, instead of meeting them, Mr. Silverblatt says. Investors who are determined to bet on one more doubling for Apple stock might want to content themselves with buying the Technology Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund. It tracks the tech sector of the S&P 500, in which Apple has a nearly one-fifth weighting. But it also has plenty of exposure to companies like International Business Machines, Google, Microsoft and AT&T, just in case Apple stumbles. After all, giants like Apple face long odds. Between 1952 and 2009, shares of the largest companies in their sectors by market value each year tended to underperform peers over the following decade by more than three percentage points a year, according to Robert Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates, a Newport Beach, Calif., money manager. Apple has recently shown a knack for beating such odds. But most stock investors probably already have enough of a stake in the company's success, whether they hold individual shares or not.

201202,Dealing a Bad Hand to T-Mobile,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary] Deutsche Telekom has a problem the size of a Buick parked in its backyard. The failed $39 billion deal to sell its T-Mobile USA business to AT&T cost the latter a breakup fee of about $4 billion. But there was a silver lining for AT&T: The uncertainty of the drawn-out regulatory process took its toll on rival T-Mobile. The fallout for Deutsche Telekom could ultimately overwhelm the breakup fee it collected, with the $3 billion impairment of its U.S. assets, reported Thursday, potentially just the start. T-Mobile USA -- which makes up about a quarter of Deutsche Telekom's revenue -- is subscale versus market leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T, and is struggling badly. It lost 1.65 million contract customers last year, leading revenue down 8%. The sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T, agreed to last March but abandoned in December, was intended to solve the latter's spectrum concerns. It also would have solved T-Mobile's spectrum problem. That now could prove expensive to sort out. And it currently means that T-Mobile's network isn't compatible with some new smartphones. After last year's waiting game, Deutsche Telekom is now trying its own fix for T-Mobile: investing $4 billion to launch a fourth-generation ""LTE"" network that can support devices like the iPhone for the first time. The spectrum it got as part of the AT&T breakup fee will help on that score. But T-Mobile will still need more mobile spectrum in coming years, so its priority needs to be finding another partner. That is likely to take the form of network-sharing, since regulators objected to market consolidation with AT&T. If it can improve its own network by launching LTE, that should boost T-Mobile's bargaining power. It also has mobile towers and fiber infrastructure it could offer in a network-sharing agreement. Discussions on new tie-ups are now under way. But finding a partner looks trickier than it was a year ago. Verizon Wireless has been signing deals with cable operators that T-Mobile might have turned to. Even a tie-up with mobile rival Sprint Nextel would likely leave T-Mobile needing billions of dollars for future network upgrades. Sure, expectations on T-Mobile's performance are low. Ascribing market multiples to Deutsche Telekom's European assets implies that its U.S. business is valued by investors at just 20 billion euros ($26.5 billion), notes Morgan Stanley. That is roughly four times forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, well below the 5.2 times at which AT&T trades.

201202,Heard on the Street / Financial Analysis and Commentary,"Deutsche Telekom: Downwardly Mobile in the U.S. Deutsche Telekom has a problem the size of a Buick parked in its backyard. The failed $39 billion deal to sell its T-Mobile USA business to AT&T cost the latter a breakup fee of about $4 billion. But there was a silver lining for AT&T: The uncertainty of the drawn out regulatory process took its toll on rival T-Mobile. The fallout for Deutsche Telekom could ultimately overwhelm the breakup fee it collected, with the $3 billion impairment of its U.S. assets, reported Thursday, potentially just the start. T-Mobile USA -- which makes up about a quarter of Deutsche Telekom's revenue -- is subscale versus market leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T, and is struggling badly. It lost 1.65 million contract customers last year, leading revenue down 8%. The sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T, agreed to last March but abandoned in December, was intended to solve the latter's spectrum concerns. It also would have solved T-Mobile's spectrum problem. That now could prove expensive to sort out. And it currently means that T-Mobile's network isn't compatible with some new smartphones. After last year's waiting game, Deutsche Telekom is now trying its own fix for T-Mobile: investing $4 billion to launch a fourth-generation ""LTE"" network that can support devices like the iPhone for the first time. The spectrum it got as part of the AT&T breakup fee will help on that score. But T-Mobile will still need more mobile spectrum in coming years, so its priority needs to be finding another partner. That is likely to take the form of network-sharing, since regulators objected to market consolidation with AT&T. If it can improve its own network by launching LTE, that should boost T-Mobile's bargaining power. It also has mobile towers and fiber infrastructure it could offer in a network-sharing agreement. Discussions on new tie-ups are now under way. But finding a partner looks trickier than it was a year ago. Verizon Wireless has been signing deals with cable operators that T-Mobile might have turned to. Even a tie-up with mobile rival Sprint Nextel would likely leave T-Mobile needing billions of dollars for future network upgrades. Sure, expectations on T-Mobile's performance are low. Ascribing market multiples to Deutsche Telekom's European assets implies that its U.S. business is valued by investors at just 20 billion euros ($26.5 billion), notes Morgan Stanley. That is roughly four times forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, well below the 5.2 times at which AT&T trades. But T-Mobile's LTE launch won't happen before 2013, and there is a risk that customers continue to depart in the interim and earnings spiral lower. With Sprint and T-Mobile struggling, the road looks clear for Verizon and AT&T to accelerate further ahead. -- Hester Plumridge Banking on Another ECB Liquidity Fix There is nothing like a shot of liquidity to set the market's pulse racing. The first European Central Bank offer of cheap, unlimited three-year loans to banks pumped 198 billion euros ($262.3 billion) of new money into the economy net of funds used to roll over existing ECB facilities -- enough to fuel a substantial rally across asset classes. But as with any artificially induced high, the euphoria is liable to wear off unless the dosage is increased. On that basis, next weekend's second Long-Term Refinancing Operation risks being a disappointment. Estimates of what banks might borrow vary from an additional 200 billion euros of net new money up to 1 trillion euros. The size of the range reflects uncertainty over what banks will do with the funds. Some banks will have no option but to take ECB loans to finance existing lending, because they are cut off from other sources of funding. Peripheral country banks clearly fall into this category. Italian and Spanish banks used the first LTRO to take care of their funding needs until the second half of this year and may use the second to secure their funding until well into 2013. Some French and Austrian banks may also need funds for these purposes, judging by the decision to ease local collateral requirements. But banks may be wary of using the LTRO to fund ordinary lending if they can avoid it, no matter how cheap, because the loans must be repaid after three years. That is less than the maturity of a typical corporate loan, let alone a mortgage. The LTRO also requires collateral at a time when banks are already heavily reliant on other forms of secured funding, such as covered bonds. A shortage of unencumbered assets could restrict future access to senior unsecured bond markets. That is why banks such as UniCredit have raised money in private markets even when the cost is well above the LTRO. The big uncertainty is whether some banks will use the LTRO to fund carry trades, borrowing cheap ECB money to buy higher-yielding sovereign bonds. Spanish banks appear to be doing this already. Madrid has raised 35% of this year's funding needs, but 65% of issuance has had maturities under five years, compared with less than 35% in normal years, according to Morgan Stanley. That points to heavy buying by banks. Italy, in contrast, has so far raised just 10% of this year's target, suggesting limited carry trades. What seems certain is that there is limited appetite for cross-border carry trades. That may point to an LTRO take-up closer to the bottom of the range, similar in size to the last one. That could disappoint those counting on another liquidity rush to support sovereign yields and slow the pace of deleveraging. On the other hand, it could also signal a shrewd awareness of the need to avoid a longer-term destructive addiction. -- Simon Nixon Gold Miners Lose Their Midas Touch Do gold miners offer deep value? Aaron Regent thinks so, but then he runs Barrick Gold Corp. Speaking with Bloomberg BusinessWeek recently, he said gold-mining stocks are heading toward an ""inflection point."" They could certainly use one. The sector has gained less than 1% over the past year, while the gold price has jumped 25%. This doesn't make sense, as miners should offer a leveraged bet on gold prices. Barrick's operating margin has nearly doubled since 2006, yet its stock-price multiples have dropped pretty steadily in that time. A changing investor base may explain this. The rise of exchange-traded funds has made buying gold itself easier, so gold bugs can migrate there away from mining stocks. Without them, gold-mining stocks trade more like regular industrial stocks. Indeed, the sector's correlation with the gold price has been on a downward trend since mid-2009. Its relationship with the S&P 500 is now significantly stronger. Miners need to focus investors on how leveraged their cash flows are to higher gold prices and allay fears that gold has peaked. Patrick Chidley, analyst at HSBC, reckons mining stocks currently price in gold at about $1,400 to $1,500 an ounce. Yet spot gold is now almost $1,800. If miners want to hit their inflection point, one way would be to raise their low dividend yields and back this by locking in higher gold prices for their output in the futures market. True gold bugs, seeking leverage to gold's gyrations, detest this, which is why miners spent much of the past decade dehedging. But such investors appear to have migrated anyway, and mining stocks clearly haven't been rewarded for this strategy. If management proves reluctant to reverse course and use the futures market to bolster their cash-flow credentials, others might do it for them. Step forward, private equity. -- Liam Denning License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,Telcos squeezed as consumers go mad for mobile Web,"LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Consumers' increasing love of using services like Facebook and YouTube on their smartphones is leaving many telecoms carriers sidelined while bearing the costs of ever-growing demands on their networks. As users lap up mobile Internet services, the Web giants are strengthening their relationships with consumers, while the telcos are finding their connections with customers reduced to a monthly bill and an occasional handset upgrade. More than half of Facebook's users already access the social network from a mobile device, Facebook said in its recent filing for a long-awaited initial public offering -- and that proportion is expected to keep growing. The operators complain that the Web giants are hitching a free ride on the networks in which they are investing billions, while free services like Facebook Messenger are eating into the SMS text revenues on which they have long depended. They've talked about charging bandwidth-heavy Internet players like movie streaming Netflix or Google to carry their traffic, but have been rebuffed by the Web giants and cooled by regulators worried that such deals would warp the level playing field of the Internet. ""The Facebook IPO is going to fuel that discussion around Facebook and Google and how these players are affecting the industry,"" said David Gosen, European director of telecoms at market researcher Nielsen, ahead of next week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the world's biggest wireless fair. ""They're driving their cars along the roads the carriers have built, and collecting the tolls, and carriers are wondering what their role is going to be in these new ecosystems,"" he said. ""I get the sense it's going to be a lively one this year."" DUMB PIPE Telecoms carriers are racing to deploy next-generation mobile networks, which will be able to carry the exponentially increasing amounts of data generated by the likes of YouTube many times faster than current networks can. The GSMA, the operators' association, estimates that telcos will have to spend $800 billion in the next five years to upgrade mobile networks and buy licences for fourth-generation wireless spectrum. Mobile connections are expected to surpass the human population in 2014, according to consultant Ernst & Young. The burden is getting harder to shoulder, especially for operators in mature market like Europe where there is little growth amid recession and tough price competition, leading many to cut their prized dividends. For many incumbents in mature markets, such as Spain's Telefonica, even their operations in fast-growing regions like Latin America can no longer compensate, and they may need to venture into riskier markets if they cannot make data usage pay. A long-term trend of dwindling revenues from core voice and SMS services is being accelerated by competition from so-called over-the-top services from Internet providers that offer free alternatives or more attractive features. Having weathered an assault on their voice revenues from a range of companies led by Skype, telcos are now battling free mobile messenger services from BlackBerry maker RIM, Facebook, and popular messaging app WhatsApp. Operators lost $13.9 billion in SMS revenue last year through subscribers using social messaging apps on their mobile phones instead, according to an estimate this week from technology research firm Ovum. ""We're moving towards social media and social networking at a rapid pace. Because telecom operators have not been able to keep up with that, they're probably going to become a dumb pipe,"" the report's author, analyst Neha Dharia, told Reuters. The operators say that on top of the capacity strains being put on their networks by Web services, Google and Apple are adding insult to injury by allowing popular apps like Angry Birds to constantly ping their networks for no good reason. Since mobile networks were not designed to handle phones constantly sending such signals, some operators have seen major outages like one at Japan's NTT Docomo last month that prompted the operator to call on Google to tweak its market leading Android mobile operating software to fix the problem. Google's Eric Schmidt, former CEO and now executive chairman, will make his third appearance at Mobile World Congress this year, as he continues a charm offensive against an industry that blames the search giant for many of its problems. Many operators resent the attention and top billing that Google continues to achieve at the show, along with Facebook, which this year is creating more excitement than all the carriers combined. Apple has never appeared at MWC. Facebook, in particular, is expected to announce plans for advertising on mobile devices in the near future, possibly next week, a move that could stimulate a leap in growth in the still fledgling mobile advertising market. Facebook's Chief Technology Officer Bret Taylor will give a keynote address, the first time an executive from the social network has got top billing at the show. ""Once again, the Mobile World Congress is very focused on the end users, which will probably result in the MWC attracting a great deal of international media attention,"" John Strand, an influential consultant to European carriers, wrote this week. ""Personally, I would have liked to see a little more focus on the technical challenges the mobile networks are currently facing and how the signalling traffic from technically inferior smartphones like some of the iPhone models is influencing the mobile customers' overall network experience."" The GSMA is said to be preparing guidelines for the industry about the signalling problem, according to a person familiar with the project. CHINESE MUSCLE Some operators are hoping that the year-old alliance of top handset maker Nokia and software giant Microsoft will provide a more friendly alternative to the powerful groups that Google and Apple have built. Nokia, struggling to compete against Android and the iPhone, dumped its own smartphone software a year ago and threw in its lot with Microsoft, whose Windows phone software is itself a distant number three in the market. Together, they have billed themselves as offering a ""third ecosystem"" more receptive to the concerns of operators. The ecosystem has yet to prove itself in terms of the vital measure of attracting the software developers who design the apps that make smartphone platforms come alive. Much will depend on the reception of Windows 8, which will be previewed at Mobile World Congress, and is the first time Microsoft will have released a single software platform for both desktop and mobile, in a drive for wider adoption. Meantime, Nokia is expected to launch a range of Windows phones including a cheaper version of its Lumia smartphone to compete with offerings from new ambitious Chinese rivals including Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo. ""Telecom operators are keen to lower subsidy costs, and Chinese companies manufacturing smartphones on either Windows Phone and Android could be seen as credible alternatives to current smartphone manufacturers such as Nokia,"" Morgan Stanley telecoms analysts wrote in a note this week. A crop of unknown Indian and Chinese companies are now gunning to make truly mass-market smartphones that go for $100-150 wholesale to the operator, as opposed to $600 for an iPhone or $300-400 for an Android phone, said Benedict Evans of Enders Analysis. ""Commodity smartphones are starting to bubble up,"" he said. ""Today if you can make a calculator, you can make a phone.""

201202,"Apple halts ""push"" email services in Germany","Feb 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has been forced to de-activate ""push"" notification features for mobile users of its iCloud and MobileMe services in Germany, after an injunction was issued in favor of rival Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc . Customers using push services -- which automatically inform users about new messages on iPhones, iPods or iPads -- will now not be able to use them within the borders of Germany, Apple said on its German support website. However, users can get around that suspension of push services by adjusting their settings so that devices download new email at regular intervals, it added. Apple said its push email service on Mac deskops, laptops and the Internet is not affected. Apple and Motorola -- which Google Inc is in the process of acquiring -- are engaged in global patent litigation, part of a broader legal fight over the smartphone market, with billions of dollars at stake. A court in Mannheim three weeks ago granted a permanent injunction against the push-email service of Apple's iCloud, and any devices that can access it. According to patent expert Florian Mueller, Motorola sent Apple an enforcement letter demanding compliance with the patent injunction. Mueller said on his widely watched blog, Foss Patents, that the ""Motorola patent at issue in that litigation harks back to the time of pagers, a predecessor of text messages."" ""Apple believes this patent is invalid and is appealing the decision,"" the company said on the website. The same court ruled in December that Apple Sales International -- the company's European sales subsidiary in Cork, Ireland -- must stop selling or distributing mobile devices that infringe upon certain Motorola cellular communications patents. That forced Apple to briefly halt the sale of the iPhone 3G and 4 models and some iPads on its German online store. Apple was cleared to resume selling the older models via its online store on Feb. 3. (Reporting By Nicola Leske; Editing by Gerald E.

201202,Deutsche Telekom: Downwardly Mobile in the U.S.,"Deutsche Telekom has a problem the size of a Buick parked in its backyard. The failed $39 billion deal to sell its T-Mobile USA business to AT&T cost the latter a breakup fee of about $4 billion. But there was a silver lining for AT&T: The uncertainty of the drawn out regulatory process took its toll on rival T-Mobile. The fallout for Deutsche Telekom could ultimately overwhelm the breakup fee it collected, with the $3 billion impairment of its U.S. assets, reported Thursday, potentially just the start. T-Mobile USA—which makes up about a quarter of Deutsche Telekom's revenue—is subscale versus market leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T, and is struggling badly. It lost 1.65 million contract customers last year, leading revenue down 8%. The sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T, agreed to last March but abandoned in December, was intended to solve the latter's spectrum concerns. It would also have solved T-Mobile's spectrum problem. That could now prove expensive to sort out. And it currently means that T-Mobile's network isn't compatible with some new smartphones. After last year's waiting game, Deutsche Telekom is now trying its own fix for T-Mobile: investing $4 billion to launch a fourth-generation ""LTE"" network that can support devices like the iPhone for the first time. The spectrum it got as part of the AT&T breakup fee will help on that score. But T-Mobile will still need more mobile spectrum in coming years, so its priority needs to be finding another partner. That is likely to take the form of network-sharing, since regulators objected to market consolidation with AT&T. If it can improve its own network by launching LTE, that should boost T-Mobile's bargaining power. It also has mobile towers and fiber infrastructure it could offer in a network-sharing agreement. Discussions on new tie-ups are now under way. But finding a partner looks trickier than it was a year ago. Verizon Wireless has been signing deals with cable operators that T-Mobile might have turned to. Even a tie-up with mobile rival Sprint Nextel would likely leave T-Mobile needing billions of dollars for future network upgrades. Sure, expectations on T-Mobile's performance are low. Ascribing market multiples to Deutsche Telekom's European assets implies that its U.S. business is valued by investors at just €20 billion ($26.5 billion), notes Morgan Stanley. That is roughly four times forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, well below the 5.2 times at which AT&T trades. But T-Mobile's LTE launch won't happen before 2013, and there is a risk that customers continue to depart in the interim and earnings spiral lower. With Sprint and T-Mobile struggling, the road looks clear for Verizon and AT&T to accelerate further ahead. Write to Hester Plumridge at Hester.Plumridge@dowjones.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,Business Highlights,"------ AP IMPACT: Lender's own probe links it to suicides MUMBAI, India (AP) -- First they were stripped of their utensils, furniture, mobile phones, televisions, ration cards and heirloom gold jewelry. Then, some of them drank pesticide. One woman threw herself in a pond. Another jumped into a well with her children. Sometimes, the debt collectors watched nearby. More than 200 poor, debt-ridden residents of Andhra Pradesh killed themselves in late 2010, according to media reports compiled by the government of the south Indian state. The state blamed microfinance companies -- which give small loans intended to lift up the very poor -- for fueling a frenzy of overindebtedness and then pressuring borrowers so relentlessly that some took their own lives. The companies, including market leader SKS Microfinance, denied it. However, internal documents obtained by The Associated Press, as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees, independent researchers and videotaped testimony from the families of the dead, show top SKS officials had information implicating company employees in some of the suicides. ------ S&P 500 index hits highest point since June 2008 NEW YORK (AP) -- A two-point gain was enough to push the S&P 500 index to its highest level since June 2008, three months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the darkest days of the financial crisis. The S&P 500 index closed at 1,365.74, beating its 2011 closing high by two points. For the second day this week, the Dow Jones industrial average nudged above 13,000 then pulled back. It rose 29 points in the morning but wavered in the afternoon. The Dow dropped 1.74 points to close at 12,982.95. American Express was the leading stock among the 30 that make up the average, gaining 1.2 percent. It was a similar story on Tuesday, when the Dow flitted above 13,000 three times but ended the day lower. The average hasn't closed above 13,000 since May 19, 2008. ------ Miracle diet pill? A safe drug is elusive WASHINGTON (AP) -- The battle of the bulge has been a big, fat failure for U.S. drugmakers. But that hasn't stopped them from trying. For nearly a century, scientists have struggled to make a diet pill that helps people lose weight without side effects that range from embarrassing digestive issues to dangerous heart problems. Earlier this week, a government panel recommended the FDA approve the latest diet drug Qnexa. The recommendation raises hopes that the U.S. could approve the first anti-obesity drug in more than a decade. It also highlights how challenging it is to create a pill that fights fat in a variety of people without negative side effects. Even Qnexa was previously rejected over concerns that it can cause heart palpitations and birth defects if taken by pregnant women. ------ Judge awards iPhone user $850 in throttling case SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- When AT&T started slowing down the data service for his iPhone, Matt Spaccarelli, an unemployed truck driver and student, took the country's largest telecommunications company to small claims court. And won. His award: $850. Pro-tem Judge Russell Nadel found in favor of Spaccarelli in Ventura Superior Court in Simi Valley on Friday, saying it wasn't fair for the company to purposely slow down his iPhone, when it had sold him an ""unlimited data"" plan. Spaccarelli could have many imitators. AT&T has some 17 million customers with ""unlimited data"" plans who can be subject to throttling. That's nearly half of its smartphone users. AT&T forbids them from consolidating their claims into a class action or taking them to a jury trial. That leaves small claims actions and arbitration. ------ Oil prices rising to near 2011 highs NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices are approaching last year's highs as tensions increase over Iran's nuclear program. The rise pushed gasoline prices on Friday to a national average of $3.65 per gallon, the highest ever for this time of year. Western nations fear Iran is building a nuclear weapon and have been trying to force it to open its facilities to inspection. Iran has refused, turning away international inspectors this week for the second time this month. The United Nations said Friday that Iran has responded to the recent scrutiny by speeding up production of higher-grade enriched uranium, feeding concerns that it is developing a bomb. As both sides dig in for a protracted standoff, investors are snapping up oil contracts in case fighting breaks out in the heart of the one of the world's biggest oil-producing regions. ------ New-home sales dip after 4 straight monthly gains WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes dipped in January but the final quarter of 2011 was stronger than first estimated. The Commerce Department said Friday that new-home sales fell 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 321,000 homes. That followed four straight months of gains in which home sales rose 10 percent. The gains came after the government upwardly revised October, November and December's figures. December's annual sales pace of 324,000 was the highest in a year. ------ New Nike shoe with outer space theme causes frenzy Sneaker fanatics who lined up outside stores overnight got their first crack Friday at a new outer-space themed Nike basketball shoe, getting so unruly in some cities that police were called to restore order. More than 100 deputies in riot gear quelled a crowd in Orlando, Fla., where the release of the $220 Foamposite Galaxy coincides with this weekend's NBA All-Star Game. In at a mall in Hyattsville, Md., one person was arrested for disorderly conduct. The shoes, part of a space-themed collection, are a draw for so-called ""sneakerheads"" who collect signature sports footgear and can resell it online at a marked-up price, sometimes for hundreds more than retail. ------ Penney reports 4Q loss dragged down by charges NEW YORK (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. reported a loss of $87 million in the fourth quarter due in part to costs related to its bold new pricing strategy that involves ditching blockbuster sales for everyday low prices. In recent years, Penney has suffered because its core middle-income customers have been among those hardest hit by the weak economy. It's also failed to make its stores fun places to shop. But under new CEO Ron Johnson, the retailer is overhauling just about every aspect of its business, including pricing. At the core of the retailer's plan is making pricing in its stores more predictable for customers and breaking the cycle of heavy discounting that has depressed the chain's profits and hurt its image. The new plan officially kicked off on Feb. 1, right after the end of the company's fiscal fourth quarter. ------ Kenneth Cole offers to take company private NEW YORK (AP) -- Fashion designer Kenneth Cole is offering to pay about $148.5 million to buy the rest of Kenneth Cole Productions Inc., saying it would compete more effectively as a privately-held company. But it appears investors want more than he is offering. Cole, who serves as chairman and chief creative officer, currently holds about 47 percent of the stock and approximately 89 percent of its voting power. The offer disclosed Friday would give stockholders $15 per share in cash, a 15 percent premium to the company's Thursday closing price. The deal values the whole company at $280 million. ------ By The Associated Press(equals) The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.74 points to close at 12,982.95. The S&P 500 index closed at 1,365.74, beating its 2011 closing high by two points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.77 points to 2,963.75. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.94 to end the week at $109.77 per barrel in New York. Brent crude rose by $1.85 to finish at $125.47 per barrel in London.

201202,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Tuesday: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc. Wednesday: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says sales to consumers dropped 23 percent from a year earlier. HP is the world's largest maker of PCs, but it's been performing badly as buyers in the industrialized world are turning their attention to Apple's iPads and Macs. Meanwhile, it hasn't been able to capture the growing appetite for PCs in emerging markets. Revenue from commercial businesses fell 4 percent. Thursday: Salesforce.com Inc. says it closed four times the number of seven-figure deals in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In the current quarter, the company got its first nine-figure deal ever. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. says its profit sank 64 percent in its fourth quarter and gives a lackluster sales outlook.

201202,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Tuesday: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent. Wednesday: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says net income fell 44 percent, while sales fell 7 percent in the first full quarter under new CEO Meg Whitman. Contributing factors included weak demand from consumers and the shortage in disk drives. Thursday: Salesforce.com Inc. reports strong earnings that validated its approach of delivering software and services over the Internet rather than on individual computers. Some of the initial enthusiasm cooled, though, after investors factored in growth from a change in billing frequency. Coming up: March 19: Adobe Systems Inc. March 29: Research in Motion Ltd.

201202,"Shares of Marvell Technology down on 4th-quarter results, 1st-quarter sales outlook","SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Shares of Marvell Technology Group Ltd. were trading lower on Friday, a day after the chip maker reported that its profit sank 64 percent in its fourth quarter and gave lackluster sales outlook for wireless and networking segment sales. THE SPARK: On Thursday, Marvell reported net income of $80.7 million, or 13 cents a share, in the three months ended Jan. 28. That compares to a profit of $222.9 million, or 33 cents a share, in the prior-year period. Excluding special items, the company's profit amounted to 21 cents a share. On that basis, the results beat analysts' consensus forecast, which called for a profit of 17 cents a share, according to FactSet. Analysts typically strip out one-time items from their estimates. Marvell's quarterly revenue tumbled 18 percent to $742.7 million from $900.5 million a year earlier. Analysts had expected $742.2 million. The company expects hard disk memory sales to bounce back as much as 20 percent, but anticipates wireless segment sales to decline sequentially in the current quarter due to seasonal factors. It also expects networking sales to be flat. THE BIG PICTURE: Marvell, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices. Like other tech manufacturers and suppliers, Marvell has had to grapple with supply disruptions stemming from heavy flooding in Thailand and the earthquake in Japan last year. Still, the company now says the hard disk drive industry is recovering and it expects to see steady improvement in each of its markets in the new fiscal year. THE ANALYSIS: JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna recommended in a research note Friday that investors avoid Marvell stock, citing concerns over declines in the company's hard disk drive and wireless business. ""We expect the headwinds to these business areas to continue going forward despite some of the exogenous shocks now being past,"" Gauna wrote. The two segments account for more than 70 percent of Marvell's revenue. Despite Marvell's forecast for improvement in its hard disk drive business, Gauna cautioned investors against ""trying to play the recovery bounce."" He noted that demand for solid state disk drives, a competing technology, is likely to intensify in the second half of the year. The analyst is keeping a ""Market Underperform"" rating on Marvell stock. Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell had a more positive outlook, and bumped up his forecast for the company's first-quarter results. McConnell is calling for earnings per share of 20 cents, up from 19 cents. He expects revenue of $765.1 million, up from $745.4 million. A call to Marvell seeking comment was not immediately returned. SHARE ACTION: Shares fell 51 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15.55 in afternoon trading Friday. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded from $11.23 to $18.93. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,T-Mobile USA chief has a steep hill to climb,"NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - T-Mobile USA Chief Executive Philipp Humm faces massive hurdles as he tries once again to get the customer-losing wireless service back on track after the failure of its proposed merger with AT&T Inc last year. Humm plans to pump up spending on technology and advertising and is eyeing structural changes to raise capital, but it is not clear that this will be enough. The executive needs to reverse customer losses exacerbated by the nine months of distraction when his parent company Deutsche Telekom sought approval for the failed $39 billion sale to AT&T. Moreover, he has to do this with a spectrum shortage and a network that is years behind those of its rivals. Humm plans to invest $1.4 billion and reallocate spectrum in order to upgrade T-Mobile's service in 2013 with LTE, a high-speed wireless technology. This year he is spending $200 million to rebrand the service to win back customers. ""2012 and 2013 will be the big rebuilding years,"" Humm told Reuters. ""We expect that to pay out big time after this."" But analysts question whether T-Mobile USA can ever catch up since its biggest rival, Verizon Wireless, started offering LTE services in late 2010, followed by AT&T last year. Another big rival, Sprint Nextel, starts its LTE service this year. ""T-Mobile will be late to the LTE party, and its coverage will lag its major competitors for some time,"" said Ovum analyst Jan Dawson. T-Mobile USA's network has been a headache for its parent company Deutsche Telekom for several years. In 2009 it sought out a U.S. partner to help it invest in network upgrades but by the next year it had abandoned that strategy and said it would look at other options like an initial public offer once it had strengthened the business. With this in mind it appointed Humm, a former McKinsey consultant with a reputation as a restructuring expert, in May 2010. But Humm never really had the chance to get started. Just two months after he presented a U.S. strategy to investors in New York in January 2011, the company announced its doomed plan to sell the unit to AT&T. That deal was ditched in late December, bringing T-Mobile USA back to square one. MOUNTAIN OF OBSTACLES Last month Humm again promised a strategy to rebuild the company. Now he is at pains to convince investors that his plan, announced on Thursday, will work as obstacles keep piling up. Along with having an older network Humm also has to contend with heavy smartphone competition as T-Mobile USA is the only one of the top four U.S. operators which does not sell the Apple Inc iPhone. T-Mobile USA blamed the iPhone for its loss of 706,000 contract customers in the fourth quarter alone. Humm said on Thursday that he would like to sell the iPhone, if Apple would only agree to his terms. But for now, the executive said he will stick to selling other smartphones. Since AT&T, Verizon Wireless and Sprint all had to accept costly terms with Apple, taking heavy hits to their profits from hefty subsidies to Apple, it would be surprising if their smaller rival could get a more favorable agreement. Also, Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe said an iPhone would come with too much financial pressure for the operator, which is already increasing spending on its network. ""It would be very difficult to absorb (the iPhone) dilution given how much the business has shrunk and how low margins already are,"" Roe said. Meanwhile, Humm is focusing investments on growth in areas such as business services. He is tripling the company's business sales force with 1,000 new employees. The idea is that selling to businesses, which are more loyal than consumers, would help reduce customer cancellations. He also plans a rebranding in the third quarter to highlight the company's focus on ""value"" services but, since T-Mobile USA is already seen as one of the best value services in the U.S. market, analysts questioned how this would help. ""It's not like it's a new message. It's been their message all along,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Larsen who noted that Sprint is also considered a good option for cost conscious customers. In fact, one of T-Mobile USA's current problems has come from smaller rivals like Leap Wireless and MetroPCS Communications, which both also specialize in appealing to cost-conscious customers. ""The absence of the iPhone, relatively poor network coverage and the influx of smaller carriers taking over T-Mobile's core customer base of young people looking for cheap service have all hurt it,"" Ovum's Dawson said. STRUCTURAL OPTIONS Humm is also looking at ""structural options"" to help raise capital for the company with an aim to making it financially independent of its German parent. But he declined to give details or a timeframe for a decision in this area. Options would involve raising new capital independently of its parent, but Humm would not say how. He told reporters that the company could use more capital to buy new spectrum as its current holdings are not enough for the LTE capacity the company would like to offer. The quest for financial independence is due, in large part, to the fact that Deutsche Telekom's focus on handing out dividends to its shareholders comes before its willingness to make the heavy investments needed to turn around T-Mobile USA. As it is, the unit, which ranks No. 4 in the U.S. market, will already weigh on Deutsche Telekom's results for the rest of 2012. Deutsche Telekom acquired T-Mobile USA in 2001 in a bold and controversial move by Ron Sommer, the German company's charismatic chief executive at the time. The purchase of the company, then known as VoiceStream, was criticized at the time for being too expensive but turned into a key growth driver for the German company for several years. But once the U.S. wireless market became more heavily saturated, it became tougher for T-Mobile USA to keep up with bigger rivals and fend off smaller competitors. Humm is taking the right steps to improve the business, according to the Roe Equity Research analyst, but he questioned whether Humm's 2-year rebuilding plan will still leave him chasing far behind rivals. ""While they're resuming a competitive posture the rest of the market place is not standing still,"" Roe said.

201202,"UPDATE 2-Molycorp swings to profit, warns on costs","* Adj Q4 EPS $0.41 v Street view $0.41 * Q4 revenue rises sixfold to $132.9 million * Company warns costs to rise in 2012 on labor, chemicals * Sees continued growth in demand, tight supply (Adds CEO comments, details) By Julie Gordon Feb 23 (Reuters) - Miner Molycorp rose to a quarterly profit on Thursday as it produced more rare earths and rare-earth speciality products, and sold them at a higher average price. The Colorado-based company said it sees strong sales growth over the next year, but warned that production costs would be higher on rising chemical and labor costs. Rising costs could also put a dent in Molycorp's $781 million budget for the expansion and modernization of its Mountain Pass mine and processing facility in California, though Chief Executive Mark Smith played down the impact. ""There are clearly cost pressures in this industry right now,"" he told Reuters. ""We are constantly evaluating that situation, making adjustments to the project management plan, with the goal of staying as close to that budget number as absolutely possible."" Molycorp expects the rare earth mine and new manufacturing plant to achieve its commercial production rate by the end of the third quarter. The company is also eyeing upgrades to boost output at its Silmet processing facility in Eastern Europe and at its Tolleson facility in Arizona. The miner maintained its 2012 production outlook at 8,000 to 10,000 tonnes of rare earth products. In 2011, Molycorp produced 3,516 tonnes of rare earth products, up from 1,830 tonnes in 2010. The average realized selling price jumped to $97 per tonne from $19 in 2010 on higher prices for the individual oxides, as well as the addition of new, higher-value rare earth products. Despite a pullback in prices in recent months, Smith was optimistic on the outlook for rare earths, which are used in electronic devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as in green technology products like hybrid cars and wind turbines. ""We do anticipate a continued growing demand for these products,"" said Smith. ""And, certainly in the next three to five years, we don't expect any significant players in this market other than China, Molycorp and potentially Lynas."" China currently produces about 95 percent of the global supply of the group of 17 metals. The country has repeatedly clamped down on rare earth exports, sending prices of the individual oxides, metals and alloys soaring. Lynas Corp is developing a 20,000 tonne a year rare earth mine in Australia with a processing facility in Malaysia, but a legal challenge in Malaysia threatens to delay the project, which was expected to start operations in June. SOARING REVENUE For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Molycorp's net income rose to $26.6 million, or 26 cents a share. That compared with a net loss of $7.9 million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-before quarter. On an adjusted basis, income was $35.9 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with an adjusted profit of $2.2 million, or 3 cents a share, in the same quarter of 2010. Revenue rose more than sixfold to $132.9 million, reflecting both the higher production and a bump in the realized selling price. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 41 cents a share on revenue of $134.95 million. Molycorp said it produced 886 tonnes of rare earth products in the fourth quarter, compared with 359 tonnes in the same period of 2010. The average selling price in the quarter was $124 a tonne.

201202,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Jan. 23: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Jan. 24: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Jan. 25: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. predicts it will start the new year with a surprisingly strong quarter. The outlook helps assure investors that LSI is past the problems caused by the hard disk shortages, which had threatened to have ripple effects on LSI's semiconductors for data storage and networking. Jan. 26: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. Marvell Technology lowers its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, citing Thailand flooding and weak year-end demand among mobile and wireless customers. Emulex Corp., a maker of data storage and network equipment, says it was able to restore full production capacity at a cost of $2.1 million, reducing gross margins during the latest quarter. Feb. 7: Emerson Electric says its net income fell 23 percent as the diversified manufacturing and technology company saw costs rise and sales take a hit from flooding in Thailand. Flooding caused supply chain disruptions that hurt results at Emerson's process management division and to a lesser extent at its network power business, delaying about $300 million in sales, most of which are expected to be recovered this year. Feb. 9: Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's second-biggest maker of PCs, says a global shortage caused by flooding is adding $5 to $10 to the cost of each hard drive. Chief Financial Officer Wong Waiming says the impact of the floods on hard drive production will ""likely continue to affect global PC supply"" into the next quarter and hard drive costs ""will continue to stay high in the short term."" Wednesday: Hewlett Packard Co. blames flooding for more than half of its drop in revenue, a 7 percent decline to $30 billion. HP says it decided to divert supplies of drives to higher-margin products. It expects constraints to continue in the quarter through April, but the effect on revenue should be smaller compared with the recent quarter. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Tuesday: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent. Wednesday: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says net income fell 44 percent, while sales fell 7 percent in the first full quarter under new CEO Meg Whitman. Contributing factors included weak demand from consumers and the shortage in disk drives. Coming up: Thursday: Salesforce.com Inc. March 19: Adobe Systems Inc. March 29: Research in Motion Ltd.

201202,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Tuesday: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc. Wednesday: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says sales to consumers dropped 23 percent from a year earlier. HP is the world's largest maker of PCs, but it's been performing badly as buyers in the industrialized world are turning their attention to Apple's iPads and Macs. Meanwhile, it hasn't been able to capture the growing appetite for PCs in emerging markets. Revenue from commercial businesses fell 4 percent.

201202,Monitoring Your Health With Mobile Devices,"Dr. Eric Topol is only half joking when he says the smartphone is the future of medicine -- because most of his patients already seem ''surgically connected'' to one. But he says in all seriousness that the smartphone will be a sensor that will help people take better control of their health by tracking it with increasing precision. His book, ''The Creative Destruction of Medicine,'' lays out his vision for how people will start running common medical tests, skipping office visits and sharing their data with people other than their physicians. Dr. Topol, a cardiologist at the Scripps Medical Institute in La Jolla, Calif., is already seeing signs of this as companies find ways to hook medical devices to the computing power of smartphones. Devices to measure blood pressure, monitor blood sugar, hear heartbeats and chart heart activity are already in the hands of patients. More are coming. He acknowledges that some doctors are skeptical of these devices. ''Of course, the medical profession doesn't like D.I.Y. anything,'' he said. ''There are some really progressive digital doctors who are recognizing the opportunities here for better care and prevention, but most are resistant to change.'' Dr. Topol may be right about the caution in the industry, but he is far from the only person with this vision. Apple was promoting the iPhone as a platform for medical devices in 2009. An entire marketplace is evolving that marries the can-do attitude of hacking devices with the fervor of the wellness movement. Smartphones make taking care of yourself more of a game, Dr. Topol said. ''I recommend these devices because it makes it more fun and I get more readings than if I ask them to do it manually.'' The enthusiasm for this vision of do-it-yourself medicine with a smartphone, though, must be balanced with the cold reality that all of the experimenters should consult with their physicians. Some of the attempts to turn the iPhone into a medical device are little more than toys. The 99-cent iStethoscope Pro app warns, ''This app is intended to be used for entertainment purposes.'' Those who have bought it have given it uniformly poor reviews. The equally poorly reviewed iStethoscope Expert 2012, also 99 cents, offers a $24 bell to enhance the sound. I experimented with a homemade otoscope, the device doctors use to look into the ears, connected to a smartphone so I could take pictures of a family member's eardrums. My son has had infections in his Eustachian tube and the doctor likes to take a look. I figured that if I could take a picture or a video of the eardrum, I could save the trouble of him missing school to visit the doctor. With the help of a little duct tape, I attached the phone to a small home otoscope from a company called Dr. Mom Otoscopes. It is just a lens, a light source and a plastic sleeve and sells for $27. To improve the image, I inserted a $20 close-up lens I had bought from Photojojo.com. The biggest problem was in the software of the smartphone. The Apple camera app balanced the light and dark over the entire image, washing out the center so the eardrum was just a sea of white. The Android camera app offered the option of using spot metering so the light balance was better. Despite all this fiddling with the optics and the software, the result was never very good. Better results require more than duct tape. Firefly Global in Belmont, Mass., makes a medical camera and sells it directly to doctors who want to share the images with patients and save them for the future. Its line includes cameras for dentists, dermatologists and ophthalmologists. Unfortunately, the $180 to $350 cameras connect to a computer, not a smartphone. The most prevalent diseases and the biggest markets are getting the tools first. Devices to monitor heart disease are already available. A French start-up, Withings, has created a blood pressure cuff for $129 that connects to an iPad or an iPhone. The cuff will automatically inflate, deflate and then record the pulse rate and the blood pressure. The app will graph the pressure over time, making trends easier to see. Withings also includes a connection to its Web site so users can share their data with their doctors either directly through their password-protected pages or through third-party sites like digifit.com. The growing incidence of diabetes is by many estimates the biggest public health challenge today, so companies are developing tools to help people with the disease manage their blood sugar. Tom Xu, the founder of SkyHealth in El Cerrito, Calif., created the Web site glucosebuddy.com to help people keep track of the sugar in their blood. The numbers must be entered manually. The site works with an app for the iPhone to gather the blood glucose level and some information about when it was taken. ''Our main goal of glucosebuddy is not to just record numbers. That's the boring part,'' he said. ''Once you know how your diet affects your blood sugar, you take your health more seriously.'' Other companies are beginning to integrate the hardware and software. AgaMatrix, a company that makes a blood glucose monitor, iBGStar, that attaches to the iPhone, worked with Sanofi, the pharmaceutical giant, to develop the tool. In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device for sale in the United States. ''When patients are dealing with chronic conditions, you might see a doctor every six weeks or two months,'' said Joseph Flaherty, the senior vice president for marketing at AgaMatrix. ''For people to have real command over these diseases, we need to close the feedback loop and give people the information they need to make smarter decisions in real time.'' Its tool, like many other pocket meters, measures the amount of glucose in the blood, but it also transfers the data to the smartphone, which helps patients to track their glucose levels over time. It is not much different from a piece of paper and a pen, but it is faster and cleaner, and it is easy to share these values with doctors and friends. Johnson & Johnson has also spoken publicly about developing a similar device. The ultimate goal is replicating the full-body diagnostic ''tricorder'' from the ''Star Trek'' TV show, a goal that is being encouraged by a $10 million prize put up by Qualcomm, the smartphone chip maker, through the X-Prize Foundation. Apps that simulate the lights and sound of the TV show prop are available from app stores.

201202,Microsoft Fights Google Over High Cost of Patents in Europe,"BRUSSELS -- Microsoft filed a complaint Wednesday with European Union antitrust authorities accusing Google and Motorola Mobility, a smartphone company the Internet search giant plans to buy, of charging too much for use of its patents, marking a new stage in a long-running feud between Microsoft and Google. ''We have taken this step because Motorola is attempting to block sales of Windows PCs, our Xbox game console and other products,'' David A. Heiner, a senior Microsoft lawyer, wrote in a blog post Wednesday. The move ratchets up pressure on Google, which reached agreement last year to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in its largest deal to date. Google already is under investigation by the E.U. authorities for possible abuses of a dominant position in online search and advertising, and Microsoft is among the complainants in that case, too. But the move also reflects how the world of technology -- awash with new devices like smartphones and tablet computers from a range of manufacturers -- actually shares many so-called essential technologies. Microsoft and Google, as well as Samsung, Apple and Motorola, are among the powerful companies furiously scrapping over how much to charge each other for using some of those key functions, like wireless communications. Google reacted sharply to the move by Microsoft, suggesting that its archrival, which paid more than $2 billion in antitrust fines in Europe over the past decade, should bear much of the blame for the onset of the patent wars. ''We haven't seen Microsoft's complaint, but it's consistent with the way they use the regulatory process to attack competitors,'' said Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels. ''It's particularly ironic, given their track record in this area and collaboration with patent trolls,'' he said, using a derisory term for rivals or companies that amass patents for the purpose of collecting fees. Experts said the move showed there would be no easing of tensions among the top rivals in the technology industry anytime soon. ''This patent war will continue to rage,'' said Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey who specializes in antitrust law. ''If the parties cannot agree, it will be left to the competition-law agencies to grapple with the difficult issues of how patents are priced,'' said Mr. Carrier, who is the recipient of a Google Research Award but who does not consult for any of the companies involved. Mr. Carrier said that a single smartphone was built using hundreds of patents, and that the owner of any single one of those patents could hold up the entire industry, helping fuel a vicious cycle in which technology companies were being ''forced to spend money to build an army of patents'' to fend off litigation. A prominent commentator on the issue, Florian Mueller, who also advises companies including Microsoft on patent issues, said that Google and Motorola would probably need to defend themselves vigorously to avoid being sent formal charges in this case. ''Google should think hard about whether it wants to get a 100- or 150-page statement of objections at some point relating to standard-essential patents,'' said Mr. Mueller, referring to the document E.U. antitrust regulators often send to companies under formal investigation. Mr. Mueller said that Motorola Mobility had shown ''aggressive litigation and enforcement activities in Germany'' and that if ''every owner of standard-essential patents behaved like Motorola, this industry would be in chaos, and grind to a halt.'' The U.S. and European authorities have cleared the Google-Motorola deal, but Google still is waiting on approvals from China and other parts of the world. In his blog post, Mr. Heiner said Motorola was unfairly trying to block Microsoft and other companies from using technology that devices needed for functions like connecting wirelessly to the Internet and playing video. Mr. Heiner complained that Motorola had refused to make patents available at ''anything remotely close to a reasonable price'' and had demanded that Microsoft remove Internet and video functions, or take products off the market. ''Motorola is on a path to use standard essential patents to kill video on the Web, and Google as its new owner doesn't seem to be willing to change course,'' Mr. Heiner wrote. Apple has filed a similar complaint to regulators over Motorola's licensing terms, and Joaquin Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, has already warned that he is treating any possible patent abuses by technology companies, including Google, as a matter of priority. This month, after giving a green light to the tie-up between Google and Motorola, Mr. Almunia emphasized that he could take measures to address ''actions by Motorola in the past'' and ''future action by Google'' in the area of intellectual property. Samsung, which makes smartphones and tablets that run on the Android operating system by Google, already is under formal investigation by Mr. Almunia for the way it has used standard essential patents and sought injunctions against its competitors in national courts. Mr. Mueller suggested that Google, in order to overcome the latest challenge from Microsoft, might need to pledge not to seek bans on products when royalty disputes arise as a number of other prominent technology companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Cisco had already done. Google should consider ''a public declaration of how they are going to use standard-essential patents,'' Mr. Mueller said. Lawyers warned that regulators now risked becoming overwhelmed by the explosion of patent complaints and needed to take timely decisions clarifying the rules of the road for the sector. ''The competition authorities are going have to pick their battles carefully to maximize resources,'' said Rachel Bickler, a lawyer at the Brussels office of Nabarro. The authorities needed to ensure ''that antitrust investigations do not become a tool in the battles between commercial giants,'' she said. But Mr. Carrier, at Rutgers, said Mr. Almunia was likely to come under more pressure because his office was regarded as ''more receptive than the U.S. to arguments about pricing of patents and competition-law violations for the high royalties charged for patents.'' By contrast, U.S. courts were ''more likely to allow the patent holder to price the patent at whatever level it wishes,'' he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Joaquin Almunia, Europe's competition commissioner, has warned Google about patent abuses.

201202,"UPDATE 1-Toshiba, Sony tap state-backed bank to fund M&A","* Toshiba to get JBIC loan to fund Landis+Gyr purchase * Sony to receive loan to fund Sony Ericsson buyout * Strong yen a blessing for M&A, a curse for earnings (Adds Sony, background, details) By Mayumi Negishi TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp will receive loans from a Japanese government-backed fund to help finance recent overseas acquisitions and cushion the blow of a soaring yen, the fund and the companies said on Thursday. The yen's strength has clobbered exporters' earnings by eroding their overseas profits and sales competitiveness, but it also helped propel Japanese firms on a record $70 billion foreign acquisition spree last year. The finance ministry set up a $100 billion fund in August to help firms that have been hurt by a stronger yen as well as those wanting to leverage the currency's strength for M&A. Toshiba said it would get $1 billion in loans via the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and other banks to help fund its purchase of Swiss-based meter maker Landis+Gyr, with JBIC's portion totalling $600 million. The electrical machinery maker bought unlisted Landis+Gyr last year in a deal valued at $2.3 billion including debt as part of plans to move into the international smart grid market. Toshiba said in a statement that the Landis+Gyr deal had been financed by a short-term bridge loan raised from private banks, and that funding via the government would enable the firm to extend the loan period and reinforce its financial base while minimising the impact of the acquisition cost. Toshiba also said that it was seeking to reduce currency risks by having the loan denominated in dollars. Sony said it would receive $1.365 billion in loans through JBIC and other banks, with the state-backed bank's portion at $819 million, to help finance its buyout of cellphone joint venture Sony Ericsson this month. The consumer electronics giant bought out Swedish partner Ericsson for 1.05 billion euros ($1.5 billion), as it seeks to exploit its music and video content to help it catch smartphone leaders such as Apple Inc. Before the announcement, Toshiba shares closed up 0.6 percent and Sony gained 0.5 percent, in line a 0.4 percent gain in the Nikkei.

201202,"Hewlett-Packard turnaround will be tough, but investors willing to wait years can see rewards","NEW YORK (AP) - Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to spend years turning itself around as it addresses internal problems and battles broader threats from smartphones and tablet computers. Investors willing to wait could be rewarded. Its market value is half of what it was about a year ago, and HP could start to improve in the second half of 2012. It won't be easy, though. After all, HP will need to fix itself as the personal-computing industry faces its own challenges, including reduced spending by consumers who are saving up for iPads and other popular devices. Richard Gardner, an analyst at Citi Investment Research, described HP's road to recovery as ""not a journey for the faint of heart."" After presiding over her first full quarter as CEO, Meg Whitman said Wednesday that she has a good sense of what the company needs to do. For starters, Whitman said, HP needs to fix its internal operations. The company is unable to turn orders into products quickly enough, and its supply chain is a mess. HP has numerous parts in its inventory, but not necessarily the right parts to fulfill actual orders. The variety also creates confusion in sales and technical support. Whitman said HP needs to invest more in internal systems and procedures. Longer term, she said, the company needs to spend more money to grow businesses such as security services, information management and Internet-based systems known as cloud computing. ""We didn't make the investments we should have during the past few years to stay ahead of customer expectations and market trends,"" Whitman said. ""As a result, we see eroding revenue and profits today."" HP reported a 44 percent drop in net income to $1.47 billion, or 73 cents a share, in the November-January period. Revenue was $30 billion, down 7 percent and slightly below forecasts of $30.7 billion. It was the fastest revenue decline for the company since the recession hit 2009 results. The division that makes PC desktops and laptops saw revenue fall 15 percent to $10.4 million. That's still about a third of the company's revenue. A shortage in hard drives because of flooding in Thailand was partly to blame. So was increased competition from mobile devices, which HP quit making last year after losing to Apple and manufacturers using Google's Android system. To pay for investments, HP needs to cut costs. Whitman didn't offer specifics; some analysts foresee ""restructuring"" -- which often means job cuts. ""We have got to save to invest,"" she said. ""We have got to save to grow."" Whitman became CEO in September after HP fired Leo Apotheker just 11 months into the job. Apotheker also complained about underinvestment by his predecessor, yet his decisions hadn't instilled any confidence. Among other things, Apotheker announced that HP was looking to jettison its PC unit, which has large volume but small profits. That scared off some buyers, who may not have come back when Whitman decided to keep the division. Whitman pleaded patience as she described ""a multiyear journey."" Investors responded by selling shares of HP. The Palo Alto, Calif., company's stock fell $1.89, or 6.5 percent, to close Thursday at $27.05. Its market value of $54 billion compares with $104 billion about a year ago. Louis R. Miscioscia, an analyst with Collins Stewart, said the stock looks cheap, but a turnaround now seems further away. He noted that IBM Corp., which transformed from a dying PC maker to a leading provider of software and services, had to work hard for more than a half decade to get there. Nonetheless, he raised his price target on HP's stock Thursday to $28, from $25. Of course, HP may be intentionally setting expectations low. Analyst Shaw Wu at Sterne Agee said many investors dismissed Cisco Systems Inc. a year ago, after its focus got scattered from expanding into too many new markets. But the network-equipment maker has reported a few good quarters in a row. The stock is up nearly 50 percent since Aug. 10. Wu expects HP's revenue decline to start slowing by midyear. That's when supplies of hard drives should rebound. Soon after that, HP could see increased sales from an upcoming release of Microsoft's Windows 8, an operating system that would work similarly on PCs and tablet computers. If that's the case, a turnaround may happen sooner and reward investors who buy HP's stock now and hang on to it. ""It's tough to count them out,"" he said. ""They have a lot of the ingredients. It boils down to execution. At least they have a game plan in place."" 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,Target's 4Q profit declines 5.2 percent amid sluggish holiday sales,"NEW YORK (AP) - Target Corp. reported that fourth-quarter earnings fell 5.2 percent due to sluggish holiday sales. But the discounter, which said Thursday that its business has rebounded since then, offered a full-year profit outlook that was above Wall Street estimates. The holiday season turned out to be fiercely competitive with stores offering deep discounts to get cost-conscious shoppers to buy. But Target's cutting wasn't as aggressive as rivals because it chose give up some sales in order to hold onto profit margins. The company, based in Minneapolis, said revenue rose 3.3 percent to $20.94 billion, up from the $21.23 billion analysts polled by FactSet had expected. Revenue at stores opened at least a year -- an indicator of a retailer's health -- rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Profit margins, meanwhile, slipped to 28.4 from 28.7 percent in the year-ago period. ""We're pleased with the pace of our sales since the holiday season,"" said CEO Gregg Steinhafel on Thursday during a conference call with investors. ""Yet, we expect we'll continue to see mixed signals in the economy going forward."" The company earned $981 million, or $1.45 per share, in the three months ended Jan. 28. That compares with $1.04 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected $1.40 per share. Target became a discount-store darling when it began offering stylish clothes and trendy decor under the same roof where shoppers could find toothpaste and cereal. Yet sales growth has been uneven since the Great Recession. Shoppers are looking elsewhere for lower prices. And rivals are copying its 12-year-old formula of partnering with designers. Like many of its bricks-and-mortar rivals, Target also faces competition from online rivals like Amazon.com, which can offer lower prices and better selection because they don't have the same overhead costs. And shoppers armed with smartphones often are comparing Target prices with online competitors in the stores. Target announced in January that it is teaming up with unique specialty shops to offer limited edition merchandise, from dog biscuits to platform shoes, as it attempts to further distinguish itself from rivals. The temporary shops will be launched in May. Earlier this year, Target also confirmed reports that it will test expanded displays of Apple products in 25 stores. These initiatives are on top of two major strategies that the discounter has implemented to increase customer traffic and boost sales-- its larger food offerings and its 5 percent discount for customers who pay with Target-branded credit and debit cards. The discounts began in late 2010. Target's efforts seem to be working. The company noted that revenue at stores opened at least a year in February is running well ahead of the 4 percent estimate for the fiscal first quarter. The company said that the improvement was across all merchandise categories. Target also noted that it expects earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.75. That reflects expected expenses related to its entry in the Canadian market. Analysts expect $4.27 per share for the year, according to FactSet. For the fiscal year that ended Jan. 28, Target had earnings per share of $4.28 per share on revenue of $68.5 billion. The company reiterated its annual goal to generate $8 per share on sales of $100 billion or more by 2017. Shares rose $1.53, or 2.9 percent, to close at $54.50 on Thursday. 5 Press Association, Inc.

201202,"The Digital Solution: Two Joysticks to Beat Smartphones at Games --- Sony's PS Vita Tries to Offer Almost Everything, but Game-Focused Features Are Still What PlayStation Does Best","Portable gaming devices have plenty of reason to sulk in the corner. The job they once dominated -- rescuing people from boredom while on the go -- is now done by smartphones and devices like the iPod Touch. Smartphones offer casual games like ""Angry Birds"" and ""Words with Friends"" that cost little or nothing to download, and also make phone calls, and send email and text messages. This week I tested the newest gaming device that tries to do many of the things a smartphone does, short of making phone calls: Sony's PlayStation Vita. It has front- and back-facing cameras; a Web browser; a store for downloading movies, TV shows and games; a music player; and an optional AT&T 3G network connection. This spring, Sony plans to add its own music-streaming service, Facebook, Skype and Foursquare. Netflix, Flickr and Twitter apps are slated to work on the device on Wednesday, when it's available in stores. All these features are still secondary to the main reason a person might plunk down $299 (3G and Wi-Fi capable) or $249 (Wi-Fi) for this device: gaming. Sony's PS Vita is the latest move by a portable-game maker to gain some ground back from smartphones. Nintendo's 3DS, which I reviewed last March, now has a Netflix app and other smartphone characteristics. The company also plans to add Hulu Plus to the 3DS later this year. Not surprisingly, I found the PS Vita did best with games and pretty well with the programs over which it seemed to have the most control. Other features seemed like they were added just for the sake of adding them and didn't work nearly as well. The PS Vita's pre-loaded Near app has a whimsical interface that showed 28 people near me who were signed into the PlayStation Network. The PS Store was easy to navigate and clearly displayed details about each downloadable item. But the Web browser can't play Flash and only partially supports HTML 5, which will make it impossible to see content on many websites. It lacks an email program, so users are limited to sending things via the PlayStation Network to people using PlayStation. Photos I took with the device could only be sent this way and a workaround of hooking my PS Vita into a PS3 or a PC to offload photos seemed antiquated. The PS Vita embraces multi-touch gestures on its responsive, bright screen. A peeling-back gesture reveals the home screen and can be used to close any program. A bubble in the top right can be tapped to see download progress or device notifications, and swipes up, down, left and right help users navigate around screens. Playful bubblelike icons represent all apps. The design of the PS Vita is obviously related to its predecessor, the PlayStation Portable. It has game controllers that flank the right and left sides of its 5-inch touch-screen, and its top right and left corners double as buttons. At 7.2 inches by 3.3 inches, the PS Vita looks like it could eat an iPod Touch for lunch. Its 3G model weighs twice as much as the iPhone 4S. This is the first portable gaming device to have two joysticks instead of one. Sony says the ""dual analog sticks"" offer better gaming. When I played ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss,"" the right joystick adjusted my vantage point and the left moved my character. People can control games using their fingers on the screen or -- in a novel twist -- on the back of the device. A rear touch pad lets fingers operate from where they naturally rest when holding the PS Vita. I played Sony Computer Entertainment America's $30 ""Little Deviants"" game by rolling a ball-shaped creature through mazes, controlling where the ball moved with my fingers touching the back of the PS Vita. While playing the $40 EA Sports ""FIFA Soccer"" game, I used the touch pad to aim and shoot the ball. I found the touch pad so sensitive that it was hard to use, but this might get easier over time. In the $50 ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss"" game, I guided the main character up a wall by moving my finger on the touch screen rather than using multidirectional buttons. Likewise, I balanced my character as he walked across a plank of wood using the PS Vita's built-in motion sensor; aiming a gun works with the motion sensors rather than a joystick. Plenty of PS Vita games are geared toward the serious gamer, with 21 of the 26 games launching with the PS Vita costing $30 or more. (These can be downloaded through the PlayStation Store or bought as PS Vita Cards at retailers.) ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss"" comes with a 43-page digital manual, which I had to read to get anywhere in the game. There are 275 PlayStation Portable games playable on the PS Vita and available for download, and pricing for those starts at 99 cents. (Games for Nintendo's $170 3DS portable gaming device range from $2 to $40 apiece. The most expensive game you can buy for Apple's $499 iPad is the $17 ""Final Fantasy III"" game by Square Enix.) Wirelessly downloading content from the PS Store only works in Wi-Fi, but the 3G model can download files smaller than 20 megabytes over 3G. I downloaded a demo mode for one game from the PS Store and 26 minutes later, it was on my PS Vita. Downloading a movie was harder: I used a $25 gift card and bought the $14.99 standard-definition (HD wasn't available) version of the movie ""Tower Heist,"" but an estimate told me that it would take over 3,000 minutes to download, and I gave up shortly after the download started. Battery life is estimated at three to five hours for gaming without network features in use. I played in shorter intervals and didn't have any trouble with battery life. At times, the PS Vita seemed a bit slow to respond. As I initially set up my PlayStation Network account for use in ""Friends,"" a built-in social-networking app for interacting with other PS Vita and PlayStation 3 users, I waited several seconds. A polite ""Please wait"" message appeared far too often. Gamers will like the PS Vita's double joysticks, while non-gamers will feel more comfortable with its motion and touch controls. But instead of competing with smartphones, this device should stick to what it knows: games. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,UPDATE 3-Rogers profit tops forecasts but wireless lags,"* Q4 adjusted EPS C$0.70 vs C$0.60 a year earlier * Cable, media segments help Rogers top forecasts * Higher costs cut into wireless profit * Dividend increased by 11 pct * Board authorizes C$1 bln share buyback program (Adds analyst's comments, conference call remarks, share price move) TORONTO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Rogers Communications , Canada's biggest wireless telecoms company, said on Wednesday that cost-cutting and growth in its cable and media businesses pushed it to a stronger than expected quarterly profit despite lagging core wireless results. Rogers also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 11 percent and launch a C$1 billion ($1 billion) share buyback program, which helped push up its shares almost 1 percent to C$38.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The buyback program allows the company to repurchase about 10 percent of its outstanding Class B shares. The quarterly results themselves were lackluster, analysts said. Profit from Rogers wireless business fell, reflecting high upfront costs tied to subsidizing activations and lower average monthly bills for its more valuable postpaid subscribers. ""It wasn't a strong quarter,"" said analyst Maher Yaghi at Desjardins Securities. ""But they managed their costs enough not to have that impact on revenue translate too much to earnings."" BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Casey downgraded the stock to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"" after the results, citing the wireless performance. Rogers activated a record number of iPhones and other smartphones but many existing customers defected to rivals. All told, the company added far fewer mobile customers than its two main competitors: BCE Inc's Bell Canada unit and Telus Corp. Rogers said it added 42,000 net postpaid subscribers in the quarter. By comparison, Bell Canada added 132,000 net postpaid subscribers and Telus grabbed 148,000. Postpaid subscribers sign multi-year contracts and typically pay four times more a month than pre-paid users. ""We did see a tick up in postpaid churn particularly at the lower end of the market,"" Rogers Chief Executive Nadir Mohamed told analysts on a conference call. ""We've got some work to do here and we can do better on this metric."" Rogers was initially the only Canadian wireless company to offer Apple's iPhone, giving it an early advantage. Bell and Telus have since built a shared national network that has helped them win market share and charge more. At the same time, the three main providers are being pressured by new, smaller competitors and by regional cable operators such as Quebecor's Videotron, which have begun offering wireless service since a 2008 government auction of airwaves. An average Rogers wireless customer spent C$58.82 a month in the quarter, a sharp drop from a year earlier, in what executives described as an ""intensely competitive environment"". The tough conditions are likely to continue and the company forecast 2012 earnings in a range of between no growth and a 4 percent increase. Although the cost of adding new wireless subscribers rose, the cost of keeping existing subscribers dipped slightly from a year earlier. Meanwhile, margins in Rogers' cable unit improved to 48.1 percent from 45.9 percent as it raised prices and cut down on the number of customers leaving, allowing for 8 percent profit growth on 3 percent more sales. Rogers expects to further reduce its cable network operating costs as it moves its remaining analog customers to digital. The company's media segment was aided by price rises for its Sportsnet channel, but a slowdown in overall advertising industry limited revenue growth. Revenue, however, had grown 10 percent year-on-year in the previous quarter. QUARTERLY NUMBERS Rogers' overall operating profit rose 2.8 percent to C$1.09 billion, in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net profit rose to C$372 million, or 70 Canadian cents a share, from C$338 million, or 60 Canadian cents, in the year-before quarter. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 67 Canadian cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to C$3.18 billion from C$3.14 billion. Excluding stock-based compensation, costs related to pension obligations and other one-time items, the company expects 2012 operating profit of C$4.73 billion to C$4.92 billion. On that basis, it earned C$4.72 billion in 2011. Rogers' new quarterly dividend payout will be 39.5 Canadian cents a share, up from 35.5 Canadian cents a share.

201202,"RIM Unveils New PlayBook Software, Ramps Up Marketing","TORONTO—Research In Motion Ltd. released a free update to the operating system for its poor-selling PlayBook tablet, part of a crucial software revamp for its device, and the company's first major product release since its longtime co-chief executives stepped down earlier this year. RIM has characterized PlayBook 2.0—an over-the-air update that the company said was ready for download Tuesday—as one of two important launches this year that the Waterloo, Ontario, company says will help it compete better with rivals Apple Inc. and Google Inc., among others. Despite deep discounts and giveaway promotions to move the tablets, the PlayBook has sold poorly since debuting last April—selling less than one million units as of December, the last time company released sales figures. In contrast, Apple sold 15 million iPads last quarter. Critics lambasted the PlayBook's initial inability to allow users access to email without having to tether the tablet to a BlackBerry, also made by RIM. Late last year, RIM wrote off nearly $500 million in unsold PlayBook inventory, a painful hit during a year in which the company lost roughly $30 billion in market capitalization. PlayBook 2.0 has email, a snappier calendar function and can run Google's Android apps. While it still doesn't have the popular BlackBerry Messenger tool, a RIM spokeswoman says a tablet app for it is ""still being worked on."" Some early users of the new PlayBook OS applauded the update Tuesday, but analysts questioned whether it was a big enough upgrade to help RIM turn around sales. ""It's a positive step in the right direction,"" said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. ""But I don't think it's going to make a difference to the ultimate, long-term success of the PlayBook. It's a tough sell for RIM to get consumers to revisit purchasing [a PlayBook] after such a poor initial response."" The device runs on RIM's newly acquired QNX operating system. Under the new name BlackBerry 10, the OS will power its next-generation BlackBerry smartphone, due later this year. RIM has said the PlayBook OS update and the new BlackBerry are vital to the company's turnaround. RIM has openly courted applications developers for the OS in an effort to build the sort of apps ecosystem that could compete with Apple and Android. Earlier this year, RIM's new chief executive, Thorsten Heins, redoubled the company's commitment to the PlayBook and the new OS, after taking the top job in a surprise management shake-up. In January, RIM's two former co-CEOs, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, stepped down after more than two decades together at RIM's helm. Mr. Heins also promised a new marketing push in the U.S. A campaign for the current line of BlackBerrys, called ""Be Bold,"" features television, magazine and online ads showing public figures using BlackBerrys. PlayBook publicity efforts also have been ratcheted higher. Singers Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony have promoted the PlayBook on their new talent-search show, ""Q'Viva,"" which airs on Univision. RIM is sponsoring the show, and hosts use the PlayBook as they search for and judge talent in Latin America. On a recent appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" Ms. Lopez and Mr. Anthony explained how the tablet allowed them to share and watch videos, and in-studio audience members that day received a free PlayBook.

201202,"Two Joysticks to Beat Smartphones at Games; Sony's PS Vita Tries to Offer Almost Everything, but Game-Focused Features Are Still What PlayStation Does Best","Portable gaming devices have plenty of reason to sulk in the corner. The job they once dominated—rescuing people from boredom while on the go—is now done by smartphones and devices like the iPod Touch. Smartphones offer casual games like ""Angry Birds"" and ""Words with Friends"" that cost little or nothing to download, and also make phone calls, and send email and text messages. This week I tested the newest gaming device that tries to do many of the things a smartphone does, short of making phone calls: Sony's PlayStation Vita. It has front- and back-facing cameras; a Web browser; a store for downloading movies, TV shows and games; a music player; and an optional AT&T 3G network connection. This spring, Sony plans to add its own music-streaming service, Facebook, Skype and Foursquare. Netflix, Flickr and Twitter apps are slated to work on the device on Wednesday, when it's available in stores. All these features are still secondary to the main reason a person might plunk down $299 (3G and Wi-Fi capable) or $249 (Wi-Fi) for this device: gaming. Sony's PS Vita is the latest move by a portable-game maker to gain some ground back from smartphones. Nintendo's 3DS, which I reviewed last March, now has a Netflix app and other smartphone characteristics. The company also plans to add Hulu Plus to the 3DS later this year. Not surprisingly, I found the PS Vita did best with games and pretty well with the programs over which it seemed to have the most control. Other features seemed like they were added just for the sake of adding them and didn't work nearly as well. The PS Vita's pre-loaded Near app has a whimsical interface that showed 28 people near me who were signed into the PlayStation Network. The PS Store was easy to navigate and clearly displayed details about each downloadable item. But the Web browser can't play Flash and only partially supports HTML 5, which will make it impossible to see content on many websites. It lacks an email program, so users are limited to sending things via the PlayStation Network to people using PlayStation. Photos I took with the device could only be sent this way and a workaround of hooking my PS Vita into a PS3 or a PC to offload photos seemed antiquated. The PS Vita embraces multi-touch gestures on its responsive, bright screen. A peeling-back gesture reveals the home screen and can be used to close any program. A bubble in the top right can be tapped to see download progress or device notifications, and swipes up, down, left and right help users navigate around screens. Playful bubblelike icons represent all apps. The design of the PS Vita is obviously related to its predecessor, the PlayStation Portable. It has game controllers that flank the right and left sides of its 5-inch touch-screen, and its top right and left corners double as buttons. At 7.2 inches by 3.3 inches, the PS Vita looks like it could eat an iPod Touch for lunch. Its 3G model weighs twice as much as the iPhone 4S. This is the first portable gaming device to have two joysticks instead of one. Sony says the ""dual analog sticks"" offer better gaming. When I played ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss,"" the right joystick adjusted my vantage point and the left moved my character. People can control games using their fingers on the screen or—in a novel twist—on the back of the device. A rear touch pad lets fingers operate from where they naturally rest when holding the PS Vita. I played Sony Computer Entertainment America's $30 ""Little Deviants"" game by rolling a ball-shaped creature through mazes, controlling where the ball moved with my fingers touching the back of the PS Vita. While playing the $40 EA Sports ""FIFA Soccer"" game, I used the touch pad to aim and shoot the ball. I found the touch pad so sensitive that it was hard to use, but this might get easier over time. In the $50 ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss"" game, I guided the main character up a wall by moving my finger on the touch screen rather than using multidirectional buttons. Likewise, I balanced my character as he walked across a plank of wood using the PS Vita's built-in motion sensor; aiming a gun works with the motion sensors rather than a joystick. Plenty of PS Vita games are geared toward the serious gamer, with 21 of the 26 games launching with the PS Vita costing $30 or more. (These can be downloaded through the PlayStation Store or bought as PS Vita Cards at retailers.) ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss"" comes with a 43-page digital instruction manual, which I had to read to get anywhere in the game. There are 275 PlayStation Portable games playable on the PS Vita and available for download, and pricing for those starts at 99 cents. (Games for Nintendo's $170 3DS portable gaming device range from $2 to $40 apiece. The most expensive game you can buy for Apple's $499 iPad is the $17 ""Final Fantasy III"" game by Square Enix.) Wirelessly downloading content from the PS Store only works in Wi-Fi, but the 3G model can download files smaller than 20 megabytes over 3G. I downloaded a demo mode for one game from the PS Store and 26 minutes later, it was on my PS Vita. Downloading a movie was harder: I used a $25 gift card and bought the $14.99 standard-definition (HD wasn't available) version of the movie ""Tower Heist,"" but an estimate told me that it would take over 3,000 minutes to download, and I gave up shortly after the download started. Battery life is estimated at three to five hours for gaming without network features in use. I played in shorter intervals and didn't have any trouble with battery life. At times, the PS Vita seemed a bit slow to respond. As I initially set up my PlayStation Network account for use in ""Friends,"" a built-in social-networking app for interacting with other PS Vita and PlayStation 3 users, I waited several seconds. A polite ""Please wait"" message appeared far too often. Gamers will like the PS Vita's double joysticks, while non-gamers will feel more comfortable with its motion and touch controls. But instead of competing with smartphones, this device should stick to what it knows: games. Write to Katherine Boehret at katherine.boehret@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,Corporate News: China Telecom To Offer iPhone,"HONG KONG -- Apple Inc. will offer its iPhone 4S smartphone through a second Chinese carrier beginning March 9, in a move that will help the U.S. consumer electronics giant expand the sale of its popular device in the country. China Telecom Corp., the smallest of the three wireless carriers in the country after China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., said in a statement Tuesday that it will take online reservations for the purchase of the device beginning March 2. But China Telecom also warned that offering the smartphone may put pressure on its short-term profitability due to an increase in marketing expenses. ""China Telecom will make an appropriate increase in marketing initiatives for the profitable scale development of its mobile services, which is expected to significantly enhance its long-term sustainable growth,"" it said in the statement. Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu confirmed that the smartphone would be available through China Telecom. Apple is aiming to increase the sales of its smartphones and iPad tablet computers in China. Despite occasional hitches -- such as an ongoing legal fight over the ownership of the iPad trademark there -- China is one of its key growth markets. Apple's sales in China and Hong Kong totaled $12.47 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 24. An iPhone compatible with China Telecom's technology will open up the use of the device to tens of millions more Chinese mobile subscribers. China Telecom has been in talks for years with Apple to offer the iPhone. In late January, an Apple iPhone compatible with China Telecom's mobile network -- CDMA 2000 -- received a network access license. In Hong Kong trading on Tuesday, China Telecom's shares were up 4.1% to close at 4.60 Hong Kong dollars (59 U.S. cents). China Telecom, the country's largest fixed-line operator, had 129.3 million mobile subscribers at the end of January. With China Telecom joining China Unicom to offer iPhones, the move may put pressure on the biggest operator, China Mobile, to reach a deal with Apple soon to take advantage of strong demand. China Mobile for years has said it is in talks with Apple to offer the company's popular iPhone handset. China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou said last year that Apple plans to use a fourth-generation mobile technology that is backed by China Mobile, called TD-LTE, on the iPhone. China Mobile had 655.4 million subscribers at the end of January, including 53.94 million 3G subscribers. In the quarter ended in December, Apple hit new sales and profit records based on runaway holiday demand for the iPhone and iPad. The company's share price has climbed in the wake of those results, closing above $500 a share for the first time last Monday.

201202,Key developments in Google's $12.5 billion Motorola Mobility bid,"Here are some key developments in Google's Inc.'s planned acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.: Aug. 15, 2011: Google announces plans to spend $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility. Google would get Motorola's lineup of cellphones, tablet computers and cable set-top boxes. More important, Google would get Motorola's more than 17,000 patents -- a crucial weapon in an intellectual arms race with Apple, Microsoft and others to gain more control over the increasingly lucrative market for mobile devices. Aug. 16: Standard & Poor's says investors should sell Google's stock because it believes the decision to buy Motorola Mobility increases the risk to the company and its shares. S&P says that although the acquisition would include a patent trove, that might not be enough to keep Google's Android mobile operating software from encountering intellectual-property issues. Aug. 22: Standard & Poor's reverses course, saying Google shares have fallen so much they've now become a good deal. Sept. 13: In a regulatory filing, Google reveals that the $12.5 billion purchase price is 33 percent more than Google initially offered. If the deal falls through, Google will still have to pay Motorola Mobility $2.5 billion. Sept. 28: It's disclosed that the U.S. Justice Department is taking a closer look at the deal. The move had been widely expected. Oct. 27: Motorola Mobility reports smaller net loss in the July-September quarter as phone shipments rises by more than 25 percent from a year earlier. Nov. 17: Motorola Mobility says its shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to accept the proposed sale. Dec. 2: With the Motorola deal still pending, the U.S. Justice Department approves Google's acquisition of online advertising service Admeld after concluding the deal wouldn't diminish competition in one of the Internet's most lucrative marketing niches. Jan. 26, 2012: Motorola Mobility issues disappointing results for the last three months of the year. It reports a loss, mirroring preliminary numbers issued three weeks earlier, amid fierce competition in the markets for smartphones and tablet computers. Some analysts have already been worried that Motorola Mobility will become a financial millstone that could drag down Google's earnings growth. If that happens, Google's stock price would likely suffer. Feb. 13: European antitrust regulators clear the deal. Although regulators say they didn't find a reason to believe that the transaction would pose any competitive problems, they raise concerns about Motorola's aggressive enforcement of its patents. Hours later, the U.S. Department of Justice also approves the deal. Wednesday: Microsoft lodges a formal complaint with the European Union's competition regulator accusing Motorola Mobility of breaking competition rules with its aggressive enforcement of patent rights against rivals. The complaint also names Google, which Microsoft fears will continue Motorola Mobility's tight hold on key patents. It follows a similar complaint from Apple. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,T-Mobile urges FCC to block sale of cable-company wireless spectrum to Verizon Wireless,"NEW YORK (AP) - T-Mobile USA, which just had its acquisition by AT&T blocked by regulators, is urging the federal government to block another deal in the wireless world: Verizon's planned purchase of spectrum from cable companies for $3.9 billion. In a filing late Tuesday, T-Mobile USA said the Federal Communications Commission should stop the deal between Verizon Wireless, Comcast Corp., Time Warner Cable Inc., Bright House Networks and Cox Communications because it would place an ""excessive concentration"" of wireless spectrum in Verizon's hands. With more wireless spectrum, a phone company can raise download speeds and serve more data-hungry devices like smartphones and laptops with cellular broadband. Verizon Wireless, the country's No. 1 cell phone company, already has a relatively large amount of spectrum, while T-Mobile, the No. 4, does not. MetroPCS Communications Inc., the fifth-largest cellphone company, also urged the FCC to block the deal. It said the parties had not provided enough information to prove that the acquisition was in the public interest. Ten public-interest groups filed their own motions to block the deal on Tuesday, ahead of a filing deadline on Wednesday. Sprint Nextel Corp., the No. 3 carrier, took a more measured stance. It didn't ask the FCC to block the deal outright, but said the agency should look closely at the wider implications of the deal, including the provision that Verizon Wireless and the cable companies market each other's products in their stores. The cross-marketing has already started in some areas, with Verizon Wireless stores selling Comcast cable service and Comcast stores touting Verizon cellphone plans. Analysts hailed the co-marketing agreement as a historic shift, because phone companies and cable companies are usually bitter rivals. Verizon Communications Inc., the New York-based majority owner of Verizon Wireless, still competes with the cable companies in providing pay-TV and broadband service. Last week, a New Jersey's Division of Rate Counsel, a state agency that advocates for consumers, asked the FCC to block the deal, also citing the spectrum accumulation issue. Verizon Wireless has defended the deal, saying it means unused spectrum will become available to wireless subscribers. In early December, Verizon Wireless announced a deal to buy spectrum from Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for $3.6 billion. The cable companies had bought the spectrum jointly at an FCC auction in 2006, with loose plans to start a wireless company or form a joint venture with one. Those plans never came to fruition. The parties said they hoped to close the deal by the middle of this year. Verizon later struck a similar but separate deal to buy spectrum held by Cox for $315 million. Cox had started setting up its own wireless service, but gave up last year, saying it would be too small to compete against the big cellphone companies.

201202,"Microsoft lodges complaint with EU competition watchdog against Motorola, Google over patents","BRUSSELS (AP) - Microsoft on Wednesday lodged a formal complaint with the European Union's competition regulator against Motorola Mobility and its soon-to-be owner Google, saying Motorola's aggressive enforcement of patent rights against rivals breaks competition rules. The complaint follows a similar step by Apple against Motorola last week. Motorola is in the process of being taken over by Google for $12.5 billion, the biggest acquisition in the Californian company's history. Microsoft fears that Google will continue Motorola's tight hold on key patents. Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have been hit by legal cases in Europe and the United States, with Motorola claiming that the companies' products are using key patents it owns without permission. Apple and Microsoft, meanwhile, argue that Motorola is overcharging for the use of these patents, which cover technologies necessary to connect wirelessly to the Internet or stream video online. ""We have taken this step because Motorola is attempting to block sales of Windows PCs, our Xbox game console and other products,"" Dave Heiner, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, wrote in a blog post. ""Motorola is on a path to use standard essential patents to kill video on the Web, and Google as its new owner doesn't seem to be willing to change course,"" Heiner added. A spokesman for Google Inc. said that the company had not seen the Microsoft complaint. A spokeswoman for Motorola didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The complaints are the latest development in increasingly acrimonious disputes between global technology giants over patents on standardized technologies. Industrywide standards play an important role not only in the technology sector. They allow products from different companies to function seamlessly together -- different mobile phones or tablet computers connecting to the Internet and each other via 3-G or Wi-Fi networks, for example. Under EU competition rules, holders of patents necessary for industry standards are required to let other companies use them for a fair price. But regulators and companies complain that holders of standard-essential patents have tried to gain an edge in the market by suing rivals over the use of their patented technologies. When the European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, cleared Google's takeover of Motorola earlier this month, it indicated concern over Motorola's aggressive patent enforcement. The Justice Department in its clearance of the merger made similar comments. Separately, the Commission has already launched a formal investigation into Samsung's similar approach to patent protection and has warned that other probes may follow. Microsoft says Motorola is demanding an unreasonable fee for using its patents, amounting to 2.25 percent of the products' total price. For a $1,000 laptop that would mean a royalty of $22.50 for using 50 patents related to a video standard. Microsoft says a group of 29 companies that hold the other 2,300 patents related to this standard charge a total of 2 cents for using them. ""If every firm priced its standard essential patents like Motorola, the cost of the patents would be greater than all the other costs combined in making PCs, tablets, smartphones and other devices,"" Heiner wrote. ""Obviously, this would greatly increase the prices of these devices for consumers."" 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,Ahead of the Bell: HP's 1st-quarter results to provide insights into progress under new leader,"PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) - Hewlett-Packard Co. will update investors on its progress under CEO Meg Whitman Wednesday afternoon when the world's largest personal computer maker releases its fiscal first-quarter earnings. The results, due out shortly after the stock market closes, come a day after rival Dell Inc. announced a disappointing performance for the same October-January period. Dell's problems stemmed from weakening sales to government agencies, consumers and the fallout from a shortage in hard-disk drives caused by massive flooding in Thailand last fall. HP, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has fallen out of favor with investors since it parted ways with former CEO Mark Hurd in an ethics scandal that erupted in August 2010. Hurd is now a top executive at Oracle Corp., which is competing against HP to sell high-end computers and technology consulting services to companies and government agencies. HP shares, which closed Tuesday at $29.35, have fallen by 37 percent since Hurd's departure. Whitman replaced Hurd's successor, Leo Apotheker, as CEO in September. She is best known for making a fortune as the CEO of online bazaar eBay Inc. and then spending more than $140 million of her own money on an unsuccessful bid to come California's governor in 2010. In her biggest decision so far, Whitman reaffirmed HP's commitment to selling personal computers after Apotheker raised the possibility of spinning off or selling the business before HP fired him While most analysts think Whitman made the right call, the PC industry isn't healthy right now. That's largely because selling new computers is becoming increasingly difficult as more consumers embrace smartphones and computer tablets such as Apple Inc.'s iPad. Making the things even tougher, there was a shortage of hard disk drives -- a key PC component -- late last year after massive flooding closed factories in Thailand. A weakening economy in Europe and a strengthening dollar in the U.S. also undercut PC sales. HP has been trying to boost its revenue by selling more high-end computers, software and consulting services, but has had difficulty because of the fierce competition from Oracle and IBM Corp. Analysts, on average, expect HP to report adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share on revenue of $30.7 billion. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,"UPDATE 1-Apple, Google, Amazon, smartphone makers sign privacy accord","* Privacy disclosures required before consumers download apps * Litigation possible for not publishing privacy notices * U.S. lawmakers say ""serious concern"" over Google privacy policy (Add fresh quote, companies comment, background) By Gerry Shih SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Six of the world's top consumer technology firms have agreed to provide greater privacy disclosures before users download applications in order to protect the personal data of millions of consumers, California's attorney general said on Wednesday. The agreement binds Amazon, Apple, Google , Microsoft, Research In Motion, and Hewlett-Packard -- and developers on their platforms -- to disclose how they use private data before an app may be downloaded, Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said. ""Your personal privacy should not be the cost of using mobile apps, but all too often it is,"" said Harris. Currently 22 of the 30 most downloaded apps do not have privacy notices, said Harris. Some downloaded apps also download a consumer's contact book. Google said in a statement that under the California agreement, Android users will have ""even more ways to make informed decisions when it comes to their privacy"". Apple confirmed the agreement but did not elaborate. Harris was also among U.S. state lawmakers who on Wednesday signed a letter to Google CEO Larry Page to express ""serious concerns"" over the web giant's recent decision to consolidate its privacy policy. The policy change would give Google access to user information across its products, such as GMail and Google Plus, without the proper ability for consumers to opt out, said the 36 U.S. attorneys general in their letter. EU authorities have asked Google to halt the policy change until regulators can investigate the matter. CAN AND WILL SUE California's 2004 Online Privacy Protection Act requires privacy disclosures, but Harris said few mobile developers had paid attention to the law in recent years because of confusion over whether it applied to mobile apps. ""Most mobile apps make no effort to inform users about how personal information is used,"" Harris said at a press conference in San Francisco. ""The consumer should be informed of what they are giving up"". The six companies will meet the attorney general in six months to assess compliance among their developers. But Harris acknowledged ""there is no clear timeline"" to begin enforcement. The attorney general repeatedly raised the possibility of litigation at some future time under California's unfair competition and false advertising laws if developers continue to publish apps without privacy notices. ""We can sue and we will sue,"" she said, adding that she hoped the industry would act ""in good faith."" There are nearly 600,000 applications for sale in the AppleApp Store and 400,000 for sale in Google's Android Market, and consumers have downloaded more than 35 billion, said Harris. There are also more than 50,000 individual developers who have created the mobile apps currently available for download on the leading platforms, she said. These figures are expected to grow. She said an estimated 98 billion mobile applications will be downloaded by 2015, and the $6.8 billion market for mobile applications is expected to grow to $25 billion within four years.

201202,Sony's Vita arrives just as market may be fading,"* Smartphones, tablets have eroded handheld gaming market * Exec says he'd be pleased with 500,000 units sold in 3 weeks * Vita device comes out Wednesday in United States By Liana B. Baker Feb 22 (Reuters) - Sony Corp's Vita hits the United States on Wednesday, the latest in a long line of mobile gaming gadgets in the spirit of Nintendo's Game Boy and Atari's Lynx. But with gaming habits rapidly changing, it may also be the last of its breed. Vita will be a tough sell to gamers who may already jam smartphones in their back pockets and lug Apple iPads around in backpacks. At $250, it carries roughly the same price tag as a basic Sony PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox. Analysts are skeptical that the product will find fans, even among the most hardcore segment of gamers that Sony is targeting with a $50 million marketing campaign. It also teamed up with fast-food chain Taco Bell in a sweepstakes that awards a Vita every 15 minutes. ""It almost feels like Sony designed a product for a world where smartphones and tablets don't exist,"" said Gartner Research Director Michael Gartenberg. ""It costs more than most phones and the same as most gaming consoles. It is hard to say who is the market for this."" People who spend hours every day playing games may not be as gung-ho for a portable gadget as before. Many have turned to low-priced or free games on mobile devices they already own. Josh Calixto, a 22-year-old video editor in Los Angeles, said he hadn't bought a portable gaming device since the Nintendo DS Lite three years ago. He just doesn't have time for it: He does the bulk of his gaming on his PlayStation or on his PC, and when he has time to kill when on the move, he will play games such as ""Infinity Blade"" on his iPad, or buy a bundle of independent programs for his Google Android phone. ""The Vita is really cool, but at this point I don't see any real reason for buying it,"" he said. ""I don't feel like it's worth the money."" He said he was not interested in the 20 or so games launching with it because he has already played some of them on consoles. While Internet reviews of the Vita hardware have been strong, gamers gripe that it requires them to buy external memory cards with Sony-specific technology at $20 to $100 each. One senior games editor at gadget blog TechnoBuffalo called this hidden cost a ""glaring flaw."" Besides $250 for the basic hardware, users could end up forking over as much as $40 or $50 for each top-flight game, plus a memory stick that will set them back at least $20. Sony will sell a more expensive version of Vita with AT&T 3G service. SONY SEES VITA FUTURE Sony believes there is a large market of consumers for the Vita, said Jack Tretton, the U.S. CEO of PlayStation. ""The target consumer is a PS3 owner, and there's 60 million of those out there,"" Tretton said. ""He's also male and in his early 20s."" Gamers, he said, will be attracted to how Vita users can play opponents on a PlayStation. Consumers can also buy versions of games that allow them to pick up on a Vita from where they left off on a PlayStation -- which can't be done on a smartphone. ""On a tablet or smartphone, you notice the limits right away with the controls or lack of depth in a game,"" Tretton said. Tretton brushed off the notion that the Vita could be the last product of its kind, pointing to IDC research from January that forecast a resurgence in sales for dedicated gaming devices by Sony and Nintendo. IDC projects the handheld market rising to $17.3 billion in 2015 from $10.7 billion in 2010. But technology threatening to disrupt the market for those devices is also gaining steam, analysts say. OnLive, a cloud gaming service founded by former Apple scientist Steve Perlman, had about 500,000 copies of its app downloaded in the Android market. The program lets gamers play console versions of games on smartphones and tablets. It can also be adapted for devices designed for gaming enthusiasts, such as the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, which is nicknamed the ""PlayStation phone."" With the advent of the Long Term Evolution high-speed mobile network and higher-performance gadgets, ""it is going to be challenging for devices like the Vita to survive on their own,"" Perlman said. Sony has so far sold 500,000 Vita units in Japan, where the console was released in December. Tretton, the U.S. PlayStation CEO, said he would ""be very pleased"" to sell half a million units in the United States in the next three weeks. If the Vita doesn't click with consumers, it would not be the first handheld device to disappoint. Consumers shrugged off Nintendo's last handheld, the 3DS, when it came out last March. Less than four months later, the company had to cut the price by $80 from $249.99 because of disappointing sales. Gartner's Gartenberg said Sony might want to consider a price cut. Vitas would be flying off the shelves at $79 or $99 each, he added. ""You have to wonder how big a misstep this may be for Sony,"" Gartenberg said, ""and does this mark the last of these type of devices."" (Reporting By Liana B.

201202,UPDATE 3-Garmin finds new direction with fitness gadgets,"* Q4 adj EPS $0.96 vs est $0.66 * Q4 rev $910 mln vs est $769.9 mln * Sees FY12 adj EPS $2.45-$2.60 vs est $2.41 * Sees FY12 rev $2.7 bln-$2.8 bln vs est $2.55 bln * Shares rise 12 pct to 4-year high (Adds details from conference call, analyst comment, background, updates share movement) Feb 22 (Reuters) - Garmin Ltd forecast a strong year ahead, signaling that increasing demand for its outdoor and fitness GPS products was offsetting declines at its traditional personal navigation device (PND) business. Shares of the company jumped as much as 12 percent to a near four-year high of $49.93, before paring some gains to trade up 8 percent. Garmin's PNDs, once must-have gadgets, have seen falling demand and prices for more than three years as consumers turned to GPS-enabled smartphones that offer turn-by-turn navigation. The drop in the popularity of PNDs forced Garmin and its European rival TomTom to look for new areas of growth. While Garmin focused more on its fitness and outdoor products and high-margin mapping services, TomTom invested in software and apps. The No. 1 U.S. navigation device maker has been seeing particularly strong demand for its fitness products, as athletes and joggers spend more on watches with GPS sensors, golfing accessories with preloaded courses and fitness apps. Along with the outdoor segment, which makes rugged hiking gadgets and dog trackers, the fitness business is expected to contribute nearly 30 percent of revenue in 2012, compared with 12 percent in 2008. Garmin expects its outdoor segment to grow 5 percent to 10 percent in 2012, and its fitness segment to grow 20 percent to 25 percent. In contrast, the PND segment, is expected to decline 7 percent to 10 percent in 2012 and contribute just over half of the company's total revenue. It accounted for almost 80 percent of revenue four years ago. ""We continue to be positively biased on Garmin as we see better-than-expected growth in Fitness, decelerating declines in Auto/Mobile, and Lifetime Maps transitioning from a headwind to a tailwind,"" Wedbush Securities analysts said in a note to clients. The full-year outlook, which came in well ahead of analysts' projections, also suggests that the company's strategy of bundling personal navigation devices with high-margin mapping services was beginning to pay off. Last year, the company said this shift in strategy would help results, but warned the nature of the business did not allow for up-front revenue, and it would see rewards only in the latter half of 2012. For 2012, Garmin expects a profit of $2.45 to $2.60 a share, excluding items, and revenue of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. Analysts were looking for a profit of $2.41 a share, excluding items, and revenue of $2.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 4th-QTR TRIUMPH Garmin's fourth-quarter results smashed expectations, as the company benefited from improved PND pricing and strong outdoor and fitness demand. While the company continued to sell fewer PNDs in the fourth quarter, higher selling prices helped boost revenue at the segment by 4 percent. It accounted for 70 percent of total sales during the period. Garmin's PND segment benefited as it grabbed market share from smaller competitors and expanded into the Asia-Pacific region, Wedbush analyst Scott Sutherland said. ""They also have a smaller but growing in-dash automobile unit. It's about 10 percent of the unit, but it's growing."" Revenue at the outdoor/fitness segment increased 35 percent to $121 million. The automotive/mobile segment revenue increased 4 percent to $579 million, compared with a 31 percent decline a year ago. Excluding items, the Switzerland-based company earned 96 cents a share, while revenue rose 9 percent to $910 million. Analysts had expected earnings of 66 cents a share, before one-time items, on revenue of $769.9 million.

201202,UPDATE 4-RIM's PlayBook gets email with software upgrade,"* Free upgrade brings email, calendar, Android apps * RIM's tablet has sold poorly since April launch * Upgrade sets blueprint for new BlackBerry 10 * RIM aims to encourage developers to write QNX apps * Heins faces his first test as RIM chief executive (Recasts first sentence, edits) By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Research In Motion on Tuesday gave its PlayBook tablet computer the ability to handle email as easily as a BlackBerry does, with new software that eliminates a shortcoming that has throttled sales since the PlayBook launched last April. Before the software update, which came months after RIM initially promised, a user had to tether the tablet to a BlackBerry to get email, robbing the PlayBook of the function that made RIM's smartphones an essential business tool. ""It's what the first Playbook software should have been from a company which stakes its brand on messaging strength, with tightly integrated calendar, email, and contacts,"" said Frost and Sullivan analyst Craig Cartier. The tablet, which RIM has had to discount heavily to boost flagging sales, is the first RIM device to run on the company's new QNX-based operating system. As such it provides the blueprint for the first QNX-based BlackBerry, due by the end of the year. For that reason, the future of the company may hinge on the tablet's success, analysts say. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company needs to have more applications available before the new phones, powered by QNX software called BlackBerry 10, hit the market. It hopes the PlayBook upgrade will encourage developers to get started. That's crucial if the company that virtually invented the smartphone hopes to make up ground lost in recent years to Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad, and a host of devices powered by Goggle's Android, analysts say. ""RIM appears to have re-positioned PlayBook from a standalone profit center at launch (at $499) to an investment to build and seed developer interest in its next-generation platform ahead of the launch of BlackBerry 10 later this year,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Abramsky said in a note to clients. FIRST TEST FOR HEINS In the months since PlayBook's botched launch, demands by investors for change grew louder and RIM's share price eroded. The pressure culminated with the departure of RIM's co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie last month. Thorsten Heins, a former Siemens AG executive who joined RIM back in late 2007, has taken the reins. How the PlayBook upgrade goes down with investors and analysts could set the tone for Heins' first year at the helm. After the release, tech websites mostly reacted with a dismissive shrug. TechCrunch said that ""what RIM has done is effectively bring the PlayBook up to speed"" with Android tablets. Gizmodo said it was ""RIM's attempt to salvage the PlayBook"" by giving it ""basic tablet functionality."" ANEMIC SALES Perhaps just as importantly, the upgrade is designed to make more apps available for running on QNX devices. It gives the tablet the ability to run apps written for Android, a tacit acknowledgement that the current dearth of RIM-specific apps has limited the PlayBook's appeal. The prospect of increased sales could kick-start the app development, analysts say. RIM sold just 850,000 tablets to the end of November. By comparison Apple, which has far more available apps, sold 15.4 million iPad tablets in its latest quarter. The update will also feature a new BlackBerry video store, initially only available in the United States, and enhanced web browsing capabilities. But two important features are missing. The upgrade excludes the popular BlackBerry Messaging (BBM) application and it is unable to integrate with existing versions of RIM's enterprise server software.

201202,UPDATE 2-BlackBerry maker offers PlayBook software upgrade,"* Free upgrade brings email, calendar, Android apps * RIM's tablet has sold poorly since April launch * Upgrade sets blueprint for new BlackBerry 10 * RIM aims to encourage developers to write QNX apps * Heins faces his first test as RIM chief executive (Adds analyst comment, details) By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Research In Motion released a long-delayed software update for its PlayBook tablet on Tuesday, hoping to give a fresh start to the unloved device and pave the path for its next-generation BlackBerry smartphones. RIM's PlayBook 2.0 software adds a built-in email function to the device, addressing what critics say was a major shortcoming of the original version, launched in April to scathing reviews. ""It's what the first Playbook software should have been from a company which stakes its brand on messaging strength, with tightly integrated calendar, email, and contacts,"" said Frost and Sullivan analyst Craig Cartier. Before the upgrade, which came months after it was initially promised, a user would have to tether the tablet to a BlackBerry to get email or access calendar and contact applications. FIRST TEST FOR HEINS The botched PlayBook launch fueled growing investor pressure that culminated with a decision by RIM's co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie to step down last month and hand over the reins to Thorsten Heins, a former Siemens AG executive who joined RIM back in late 2007. The pair, who built the BlackBerry maker into a household name, weathered a storm of criticism in recent years as Apple's iPhone and iPad, and the army of devices powered by Google's Android system, eclipsed their email-focused BlackBerry. How the PlayBook upgrade goes down with investors and analysts could set the tone for Heins' first year at the helm. The tablet, which RIM has discounted heavily to boost flagging sales, runs on the company's new QNX-based operating system and provides the blueprint for the first QNX-based BlackBerry, due out by the end of the year. the Waterloo, Ontario-based company needs to have more QNX applications available before the new phones, powered by QNX software called BlackBerry 10, hit the market. It hopes the PlayBook upgrade will encourage developers to get started. Analysts consider that crucial if the company that virtually invented the smartphone hopes to make up ground lost in recent years to Apple and Android. ""RIM appears to have re-positioned PlayBook from a standalone profit center at launch (at $499) to an investment to build and seed developer interest in its next-generation platform ahead of the launch of BlackBerry 10 later this year,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Abramsky said in a note to clients. ANEMIC SALES The free upgrade also gives the tablet the ability to run applications written for Android, a tacit acknowledgement by the company that the dearth of RIM-specific apps has limited its appeal. RIM sold just 850,000 PlayBooks to the end of November. By comparison Apple sold 15.4 million iPad tablets in its latest quarter. RIM said the upgrade would add thousands of apps to its store, which currently has far fewer than Apple and Android stores. The PlayBook software update will also feature a new BlackBerry video store and enhanced web browsing capabilities. But at least two important features are missing. The upgrade excludes the popular BlackBerry Messaging (BBM) application and it is incapable with running older versions of RIM's enterprise server software. That gives it limited appeal to RIM's core audiences of corporate users and BBM fans, Abramsky said. Shares of RIM, which have tumbled close to 80 percent over the last year, rose 1 percent to $15.21 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.

201202,Apple to Offer iPhone Through Second Chinese Carrier,"HONG KONG—Apple Inc. will offer its iPhone 4S smartphone through a second Chinese carrier beginning March 9, in a move that will help the U.S. consumer electronics giant expand the sale of its popular device in the country. China Telecom Corp., the smallest of the three wireless carriers in the country after China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., said in a statement on Tuesday that it will take online reservations for the purchase of the device beginning March 2. But it also warned that offering the smartphone may put pressure on its short-term profitability due to an increase in marketing expenses. ""China Telecom will make an appropriate increase in marketing initiatives for the profitable scale development of its mobile services, which is expected to significantly enhance its long-term sustainable growth,"" it said in the statement. Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu confirmed that the smartphone would be available through China Telecom. Apple is aiming to increase the sales of its smartphones and iPad tablet computers in China. Despite occasional hitches—such as an ongoing legal fight over the ownership of the iPad trademark there—China is one of its key growth markets. Apple's sales in China and Hong Kong totaled $12.47 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 24. An iPhone compatible with China Telecom's technology will open up the use of the device to tens of millions more Chinese mobile subscribers. China Telecom has been in talks for years with Apple to offer the iPhone. In late January, an Apple iPhone compatible with China Telecom's mobile network—CDMA 2000—received a network access license. In early Hong Kong trading on Tuesday, China Telecom's shares initially rose as much as 2.1%, but were later up just 0.2% to 4.43 Hong Kong dollars (US$0.57) late morning. China Telecom, the country's largest fixed-line operator, had 129.3 million mobile subscribers at the end of January. With China Telecom joining China Unicom to offer iPhones, the move may put pressure on the biggest operator, China Mobile, to reach a deal with Apple soon to take advantage of strong demand. China Mobile for years has said it is in talks with Apple to offer the company's popular iPhone handset. China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou said last year that Apple plans to use a fourth-generation mobile technology that is backed by China Mobile, called TD-LTE, on the iPhone. China Mobile had 655.4 million subscribers at the end of January, including 53.94 million 3G subscribers. In the quarter ended in December, Apple hit new sales and profit records based on runaway holiday demand for the iPhone and iPad. The company's share price has climbed in the wake of those results, closing above $500 a share for the first time last Monday. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201202,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP) - Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of euro1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a euro1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of euro745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Tuesday: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent.

201202,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","NEW YORK (AP) - A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Tuesday: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc.

201202,BlackBerry maker Research in Motion releases new software for its PlayBook tablet,"TORONTO (AP) - Research In Motion released a free upgraded operating system for its struggling PlayBook computer tablet on Tuesday, almost a year later than it first said it would. The BlackBerry maker said the software allows for built-in email, calendar and contacts on the tablet. When RIM launched the PlayBook last April it said would add the critical features within 60 days, but later pushed that back to the summer and then to October and finally to February. The PlayBook received negative reviews because it launched without an email program and the popular messaging service BlackBerry Messenger. The new version still doesn't include the popular messaging service. The PlayBook OS 2.0 software update is available as a free download. It also allows users to use their BlackBerry's as a keyboard and mouse for the Playbook. The PlayBook is RIM's first effort to branch out from its smartphone base and capture a portion of the tablet computer market. The tablets however haven't been selling well, forcing the company to sell them at a deep discount. In December, the tablets that originally cost $500 were selling for $200, below the cost of making them. RIM wrote off $485 million worth of inventory. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said they sold 150,000 Playbook tablets last quarter. That number pales in comparison to the top-selling iPad, of which Apple shipped 15.4 million units during its most recent quarter. Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis stepped aside as RIM's co-CEOs last month. Thorsten Heins became the new chief as the once-iconic maker of the BlackBerry smartphone confronts the most difficult period in its history. Americans are abandoning their Blackberrys for flashier touch-screen phones such as Apple's iPhone and various competing models that run Google's Android software. RIM's U.S. market share of smartphones dropped from 44 percent in 2009 to 10 percent in 2011, according to market researcher NPD Group. The company still has 75 million active subscribers, but many analysts believe the company will lose market share internationally, just as it has in the U.S. RIM, which was worth more than $70 billion a few years ago, now has a market value of $7.8 billion. Shares fell 19 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $14.88 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Analysts have said RIM's future depends on a delayed new software platform for its BlackBerry smartphone. RIM said in December the new phones deemed critical to the company's future would be delayed until late this year. Heins, formerly a little known chief operating officer, said getting the new phones to market this year is his top priority. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201202,HP's 4Q to provide snapshot of new CEO's progress,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Hewlett-Packard Co. CEO Meg Whitman will get a chance to persuade investors that she is well on her way to cleaning up the mess left behind by her predecessor when the world's largest personal computer maker reports its fiscal first-quarter earnings. WHAT TO WATCH FOR: The results, due out after the stock market closes Wednesday, will be as much of a rehabilitation update as a breakdown of HP's financial performance for the November-through-January period. Whitman, who had a successful stint as eBay Inc.'s CEO before failing in her 2010 bid to elected California's governor, took over the HP's top job five months ago after the company fired Leo Apotheker to end his 11-month reign. That means this report will cover HP's first full quarter with Whitman at the helm. Since her arrival, Whitman has spent much of her time trying to rebuild employee morale, regain customers' confidence and repair the damage under Apotheker. Her biggest decision so far has been to hold on to the PC business that Apotheker announced he was considering discarding. While most analysts think Whitman made the right call, the PC industry isn't healthy right now. That's largely because selling new computers is becoming increasingly difficult as more consumers embrace smartphones and computer tablets such as Apple Inc.'s iPad. Making the things even tougher, there was a shortage of hard disk drives -- a key PC component -- late last year after massive flooding closed factories in Thailand. A weakening economy in Europe and a strengthening dollar in the U.S. also undercut PC's sales. HP's indecision on whether it wanted to keep making PCs didn't help matters either. The uncertainty caused some companies and consumers who were still interested in buying PCs to choose products from vendors firmly committed to staying in the business. A report by the research firm IDC already has chronicled HP's PC struggles during the final three months of last year -- a span that included the holiday shopping season. IDC estimated HP shipped 15.1 million PCs worldwide during the October-December period, a 16 percent drop from the same time in 2010. During the same three-month stretch last, Apple sold 15.4 million iPads. With the shift toward tablets accelerating, analysts participating in HP's earnings conference call may press Whitman for details on how HP plans to adapt, especially the company has decided to give away its own mobile webOS software to open-source developers. Microsoft Corp.'s upcoming release of Windows 8, an operating system designed for tablets as well as PCs, may hold one of the future keys for HP. But Windows 8 isn't expected to hit the market until the later summer or early autumn. HP has been trying to boost its revenue by selling more high-end computers, software and consulting services in recent years, but has had difficulty because of competition from IBM Corp. and Oracle Corp. WHY IT MATTERS: Despites its troubles, HP remains one of the world's best-known technology companies and a major employer with about 350,000 workers worldwide. It is also one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones industrial average. The company's stock has been a drag on the Dow since HP got rid of Mark Hurd as its CEO in an ethics scandal that erupted in August 2010. HP shares closed last week at $29.59, down 36 percent since Hurd's departure. The Dow Jones average has gained 22 percent during that time. WHAT'S EXPECTED: Excluding special charges and other items unrelated to its ongoing business, HP is expected to earn 87 cents per share on revenue of $30.7 billion, based on a survey of analysts by FactSet. LAST YEAR'S QUARTER: HP earned $2.6 billion, or $1.17 per share, on revenue of $32.3 billion at the same time last year. Excluding certain items, HP earned $1.36 per share. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,RIM Weighs Bleak Options,"Research In Motion Ltd.'s new chief executive faces two bleak options: Attempt a bold turnaround of the embattled BlackBerry maker, or find a willing buyer. Neither will be an easy task. RIM said sales of BlackBerrys fell sharply in the latest quarter, leading to the company's first revenue decline in seven years. Its subscriber growth rate from the previous quarter also hit an all-time low of 3%. And two of RIM's top officers stepped down, leaving RIM's executive bench as shallow as it has ever been. Meanwhile, morale has flagged amid the unrest, according to executives inside and outside the company. At a dinner meeting in February between RIM's chief technology officer, David Yach, one of the executives who left Thursday, and chief information officers from companies and government agencies, including the Department of Defense, the mood from the RIM side was somber, according to a person who attended the dinner. ""It was like going to a wake,"" this person said. A RIM spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Yach was at the meeting, but said she was unable to confirm the details. The turmoil has ratcheted up pressure on RIM's rookie CEO, Thorsten Heins, to execute flawlessly on what will be the company's most important product launch, the new BlackBerry 10 operating system. Mr. Heins said Thursday RIM is still planning to roll out new BlackBerry smartphones later this year. But RIM also said it was conducting a ""comprehensive review of strategic opportunities."" Mr. Heins, asked specifically about a sale, didn't rule it out. RIM hasn't actively sought financial advice on its options yet and may not go down the path of a sale at all, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Mr. Heins' willingness to consider a wider range of options than his predecessors gave RIM shares a lift on Friday. The stock gained 7% to $14.70 in New York. In an address to RIM employees Friday morning, Mr. Heins said the company would be run as a ""leaner"" ship going forward, but didn't warn of additional layoffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Heins also hasn't yet appointed a chief marketing officer, one of his first pledges after succeeding former co-chiefs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis earlier this year. At a time of distress, he will also now need to recruit executives to fill the CTO and chief operating officer positions. As long as the odds of a turnaround seem, a sale isn't a sure thing either. The company's market capitalization hovers over $7 billion, a big bite for any buyer to swallow. Some bankers said there would be few buyers at that price tag for the whole company. The exception would be giants like Microsoft Corp. andNokia Corp. The two explored a joint bid for RIM last year, according to people familiar with the situation, but those talks were preliminary and didn't lead to a bid. Nokia has adopted Microsoft's operating system for its latest smart phones. Given that close partnership, the two could make a coordinated approach, if they decided to bid, according to people familiar with the situation. If they jointly bid, the two companies would likely scrap RIM's mobile operating system and instead equip BlackBerrys with Microsoft's Windows software, with Microsoft taking over RIM's enterprise network, these people said. RIM says it doesn't comment on rumors and speculation. If RIM's market cap continues shrinking, some bankers and analysts said RIM could get small enough for someone to buy the company just for its patents. Among the most valuable are its patents around security. Still, even the enterprise business is under long-term threat as corporate customers offer employees the option of using devices other than BlackBerrys for work. Technology and telecommunications companies have sought to beef up their patent holdings in recent years to protect themselves from lawsuits alleging patent infringement. A key challenge for a foreign buyer could be the Canadian government, which requires that foreign companies demonstrate a ""net benefit"" to Canada in any big takeover deal. A foreign buyer may be more palatable if it teamed up with a Canadian company. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said he hopes to see RIM grow as a ""Canadian company,"" a phrase Canada's finance minister repeated to reporters Friday. But Finance Minister Jim Flaherty also said RIM ""will be masters of their own universe."" Even companies from countries with strong ties with Canada, such as Microsoft, would face scrutiny. Canadian officials would likely weigh national security concerns alongside economic ones. A sale isn't the only strategic option RIM has. As part of its review, RIM itself might decide to close parts of its business to focus on its few remaining strengths, though no decisions have been made, a person familiar with the company's thinking said. The handset business, for instance, has been hurt by competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhones and Android-based phones that have features customers want, and RIM could decide to pull out of it entirely to focus on its core enterprise network assets, which include the networks over which emails get sent, some people said. Last year, the company had received queries from financial investors, including sovereign wealth and pension funds, offering to put in cash in exchange for a minority stake, but RIM turned down those offers, according to people familiar with the matter. These people said it was possible such efforts could be revived. --- Anton Troianovski contributed to this article. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Time to Catch a Falling BlackBerry?,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary] Research In Motion has finally issued a call for help. With the business in free-fall, it makes little sense for an acquirer to answer. Yet that is the bet being made by the BlackBerry maker's investors. Despite very weak financial results for the most recent quarter, shares jumped 7.1% Friday after CEO Thorsten Heins said he is willing to sell the company. Mr. Heins has changed his tune drastically since taking over 10 weeks ago. Then, he expressed optimism about the company's prospects, claiming a new marketing strategy could help turn RIM around. But it was always difficult to believe that a new slogan could help sell outmoded smartphones. The question is whether a potential acquirer like Microsoft will want to catch a falling knife. RIM's smartphone shipments fell 26% last quarter from the same period a year ago. The company acknowledges that it has no high-end products to compete with devices like Apple's iPhone or the Samsung Galaxy, and it is being forced to lower prices for its devices as it increasingly fights for share at the low end of the market. Sales in international markets had been a bright spot, with the BlackBerry serving as a solid entry-level smartphone. Yet that success is now being undercut by rivals that are offering cheaper handsets to steal RIM's market share. According to estimates from Strategy Analytics, RIM had 14.5% share of the global smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2010. That fell to 8.5% a year later, and Strategy Analytics sees it falling to 7% in the first quarter of this year. And as BlackBerry handset sales plunge, that puts at risk high-margin subscription fees RIM generates by delivering email via its proprietary network of servers. At about 77 million, the number of subscribers grew only 3% or so in the most recent quarter compared with the prior one. A year ago, the subscriber base was still rising quickly. And any growth from here is expected to come internationally, from lower-priced subscription plans. Might an acquirer simply shut down the bleeding handset business and milk the network business for cash? Not likely. Severance and other costs would make that expensive. There might also be a serious backlash in Canada, where RIM is still seen as a source of national pride. On its present course, RIM risks becoming another handset flameout like Palm. The hand-held pioneer was eventually bought by Hewlett-Packard when on its last legs in 2010. Soberingly, for any daring wannabe RIM acquirers, Palm's handset business was closed soon after anyway. RIM still has hope that a new operating system, known as BlackBerry 10, will save the company. Yet sales of tablets sporting the operating system have disappointed. And smartphones based on it aren't expected to ship until later this year, when they are likely to be competing with a new iPhone model from Apple. RIM may look cheap, but it is likely to get cheaper. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Google Heightens Rivalry With iPad,"Google Inc., undaunted by a short-lived attempt to market and sell smartphones on its own, is now trying the approach with tablet computers in a quest to capture market share from Apple Inc.'s iPad. The Internet search company will sell co-branded tablets directly to consumers through an online store like rivals Apple and Amazon.com Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The move is an effort to turn around sluggish sales of tablet computers powered by Google's Android software. Google went this route with Android-powered smartphones in 2010 when it offered a device called the Nexus One made by HTC Corp. But the effort was scrapped after several months amid better sales of other Android-powered smartphones. Like the Nexus One, some future Android tablets are expected to be co-branded with Google's name, said people familiar with the matter. The company is expected to sell devices from a variety of manufacturers. Google won't make the devices and its existing partners such as Samsung Electronics Co. and AsusTeK Computer Inc. will be responsible for the hardware, these people said. One co-branded tablet that may be sold in the online store is due to be released later this year by Taiwan-based Asus, said one of these people. Details of the project remain unclear, including when Google plans to unveil the online store. Google is expected to release the next version of its Android software, called Jelly Bean, in the middle of this year, people familiar with the matter have said. Google will soon manufacture its own tablets, due to its pending $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., which has been approved in the U.S. and in Europe and is awaiting approval by Chinese authorities. People familiar with the Google's plans said Motorola tablets are expected to be offered in the online store. A Google spokesman declined to comment, as did an Asus spokeswoman. By selling tablets directly to consumers, Google is upping the ante against Apple, which debuted its market-leading iPad two years ago. Android-based tablets made by Samsung and others have been slow sellers by comparison. Last fall research firm Gartner estimated Apple would capture 73% of the tablet market versus 17% for Android. Google also faces competition from Amazon.com, which last year jumped into tablets with its $199 Kindle Fire, in a move to scoop up the less-expensive side of the market. Google believes the current model for selling tablets is broken, said people familiar with its strategy. Google has watched as wireless carriers, who helped Android become the No. 1 mobile operating system for smartphones, have struggled to replicate that success with tablets. While some wireless industry executives said Google's Nexus One smartphone effort was a failure, Google Android chief Andy Rubin said previously that the company sold more than 100,000 of these phones in three months and ""broke even"" on its investment. Mr. Rubin said Google stopped the effort because other Android-powered phones were on par with or better than the Nexus One. Google also couldn't figure out how to sell the Nexus One online on a global scale, he said, and its resources would be wasted in trying to line up wireless carriers in foreign countries to sell plans for the phone. This time, however, Google won't have to worry about pairing with wireless carriers because tablets are primarily used with WiFi connections in people's homes. To boost the prospects of its new online tablet store, Google was considering subsidizing the cost of future tablets in order to compete on pricing with Amazon's Kindle Fire, said one person with knowledge of the effort. In addition, Google will lend huge marketing support to the online tablet store, said people familiar with the effort. Since the Nexus One experiment, Google has honed its mass-marketing skills, spending heavily on TV ads and other marketing to promote services other than its Web-search engine. The first tablet running Android software optimized for tablets, Motorola's Xoom, went on sale in February 2011, nearly 11 months after the first iPad arrived. Motorola has said it sold about one million Xoom tablets in 2011, below its expectations. Several other Android-powered tablets, including two versions of Dell Inc.'s Streak tablets, have been discontinued. Physical stores will still remain an important sales channel for Google. Some U.S. retailers are anxious for an Apple rival to emerge in the market, said people familiar with the matter. Some retailers that sell iPads have chafed under Apple's rules that require stores to promote its products more prominently, these people said, and the retailers generate less revenue per sale of Apple products versus other devices. Google has taken other steps to be a consumer electronics brand. The company is directly overseeing the manufacturing of a Google-branded music and video streaming device, to be used in people's homes, which it is expected to sell to consumers later this year, people familiar with the matter have said. It is unclear whether Google will offer the device as part of its new online store. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,"Best Buy Forced to Rethink Big Box --- As Shopper Habits Change in a Mobile World, Electronics Retailer Pares Stores, Tests Smaller Formats","Best Buy Co., which once out-muscled rivals with stores as big as 58,000 square feet, is moving away from the ""big box"" business model that it long used to crush competitors in consumer- electronics retailing. The electronics giant -- now itself being out-manuevered by Internet rivals with lower operating costs -- plans several new tactics to improve weak sales. On Thursday it said it will close 50 big-box stores this year, and test remodeled store formats in San Antonio and Minneapolis. It will also lay off 400 workers as part of a plan to trim $800 million in costs and restructure its ailing business. Coming next: Hundreds of small stores that will focus on selling mobile phones. Consumers armed with smartphones are changing the fundamental relationship between shopper and retailer. The new ease of mobile shopping and price comparison is accelerating the trend of ""showrooming"" -- where shoppers come in to stores to see an item but buy it elsewhere. It is a particular problem for Best Buy because electronics are expensive enough to make price comparisons worthwhile, and because electronics are easy to order online. The trend greatly benefits Amazon.com Inc. and other Internet retailers, which aren't required to collect sales taxes in most states and aren't encumbered by the costs of running physical locations. Best Buy also has been outshone by Apple Inc.'s fast-growing gadget stores, which deliver some of the highest sales in retailing. The company says it is not headed to the retail graveyard that swallowed one-time rival Circuit City Stores Inc., in 2009. But it acknowledged that earlier efforts to tweak its strategy, rather than overhaul it, haven't succeeded. ""I am not satisfied with the pace or degree of change we have made up to this point,"" Chief Executive Brian Dunn said in a conference call with analysts, adding, ""We are evolving our retail store strategy. We are increasing our points of presence while decreasing our overall square footage."" Best Buy shares have lost more than half of their value in the past five years, and dropped another 7% Thursday to $24.77 on the New York Stock Exchange. The changes were announced along with dreary quarterly results. Best Buy had a loss of $1.7 billion, or $4.89 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $651 million, or $1.62 a share. It included $2.6 billion in restructuring costs and other charges previously announced as it exited its big-box store business in the U.K. In an interview Thursday, Mr. Dunn said that he remains confident that Best Buy can compete against online retailing rivals. ""While we know 'showrooming' happens, we continue to be the No. 1 player in consumer electronics,"" said Mr. Dunn, a one-time store manager. ""Really, if a customer comes into our store to see something, I like our odds."" If they come in. Apple's namesake stores have eroded the status of specialty chains as the one-stop shops for the latest in gadgetry. Apple stores notched $6.1 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in December, a 59% increase over the previous year. (Apple's total revenue for the quarter jumped 73% to $46.3 billion.) Best Buy's revenue in the latest quarter rose 3.4% to $16.63 billion. But Best Buy's sales at stores, websites and call centers open at least 14 months fell 2.4% compared with the year before. The decline, largely due to drops in TV and laptop sales, came despite a 21% gain in online sales. Best Buy itself sells Apple devices. A recent survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found that 13% of U.S. iPhone buyers over a three-month period bought the phones at Best Buy, while 15% got them at Apple's stores. But competition from Apple and the stores of phone carriers has left Best Buy with a smaller share in the new hot electronics category than it has traditionally had in former best-sellers such as flat-screen televisions and DVD players. In a strategy that mimics the Apple stores' ""Genius Bars,"" Best Buy is testing what it calls ""connected store"" formats in the Twin Cities and San Antonio in time for the Christmas buying season. The stores, which will emphasize services such as tech support and wireless connections, will feature large hubs at their center to assist shoppers, as well as reconfigured checkout lanes and new areas to speed the pickup of items bought online. Best Buy also said it planned to more aggressively court frequent customers by boosting its loyalty program to include free expedited shipping and a 60-day price-match guarantee. Addressing complaints about customer service, Best Buy said it would substantially increase worker training and offer staffers financial incentives, a strategy that has already boosted mobile phone sales. But the company will reward teams of employees and isn't returning to the individual sales commissions that Best Buy nearly made extinct in consumer electronics with its no-commission sales force. Many analysts said the move to rethink the purpose of Best Buy stores was long overdue, noting that closing 50 out of 1,100 big stores amounts to a reduction of just 4.5%. Many had labeled as inadequate Best Buy's previous pledge to shrink its square footage by 10%. ""This is what needs to be happening,"" said David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott, who believes that Best Buy remains positioned to prosper in the long term with a smaller-store presence. The accelerated move to smaller stores is a major departure from the old winning formula for Best Buy, which swept across America in the 1990s and 2000s with megastores that used wide selections of discounted movies and music discs to lure in customers for higher-priced items. Best Buy's dominant position appeared secured during the recession when archrival Circuit City declared bankruptcy and liquidated, but declining movie and CD sales caught up with the company. It cut back on the merchandise, leaving huge spaces in its cavernous stores, most of which are 30,000 to 45,000 square feet. The company projected earnings of between $3.50 to $3.80 a share for its new fiscal year, and generally flat revenue of $50 billion to $51 billion. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,"BlackBerry Maker in Turmoil --- RIM Weighs Sale, Other Options as Top Executives Leave; Reversal for New CEO","TORONTO -- The new chief executive of BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. is overhauling the company's executive ranks and exploring strategic options, including a sale of the struggling smartphone pioneer. The changes include the exit of longtime executive Jim Balsillie, who had presided over RIM's rise and steep fall. Mr. Balsillie, who until earlier this year was co-CEO, resigned his board seat and is parting ways with a company he helped run for 20 years. The overhaul comes just two months after Thorsten Heins took the reins at RIM and confidently proclaimed there was no need for ""seismic"" change. But with the company's sales tumbling 25% in the latest quarter, new BlackBerrys piling up unsold and a crucial lineup of new devices still not expected to arrive until later this year, Mr. Heins is taking more drastic actions. RIM will back out of its high-profile attempt to win business among consumers to focus on its core corporate customers. The company also said its chief operating officer, Jim Rowan, and its chief technology officer, David Yach, would be leaving. The moves are an attempt to ensure the survival of the Canadian company as it makes an effort to catch up with rivals like Apple Inc. and Google Inc., that are winning away its customers at an accelerating pace. Technology bankers say the field of potential buyers for the entire company is limited, although there could be buyers for parts of its business, such as its software assets, its network, and its portfolio of patents related to wireless technology. Last year, Microsoft Corp. and Nokia Corp. discussed making a joint bid for RIM, people familiar with the matter said, but those talks were very preliminary. Microsoft, which already has partnerships with RIM, has long been considered a suitor. Analysts have said a deal would give Microsoft a foothold in the handset market. Still, Microsoft hasn't made a public move and could be waiting for RIM's stock to get even cheaper before it decides to pursue a deal. Microsoft declined to comment. Messrs. Balsillie, Rowan and Yach also couldn't be reached. RIM shares have lost about 75% of their value in the past year. In after-hours trading Thursday, RIM was down 28 cents, or 2%, to $13.45, after closing at $13.73 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. A key challenge for any potential buyer could be the Canadian government. Despite its troubles, RIM is seen as a source of national pride. It is also a large employer in Waterloo, Ontario, where it is based. After the bankruptcy of another Canadian company, Nortel Networks Corp., in 2009, Canadian officials had touted the country still had RIM. RIM popularized mobile email, and its devices were once a badge of success in the corporate world. But companies and even governments have moved rapidly away from RIM, which was outsold by Apple's iPhone last year even in its home market of Canada. The damage was evident in RIM's fourth quarter, which ended March 3. Revenue dropped by 25% from the same quarter a year earlier, and the company said it would write off $267 million worth of unsold BlackBerry 7 models, its newest device. Apple, by contrast, saw its sales rise 73% in the three months through December. Mr. Heins warned the pain isn't over and the company's sales and profit will be under pressure for the next year. The new CEO said he is confident the company has valuable assets and good prospects, but said its turnaround will be risky and that he needs to hedge its bets, including by considering tie-ups with bigger partners. In the past, Mr. Heins has signaled he wasn't interested in selling the company. But after two months on the job, Mr. Heins said he realized the challenges facing the company are much more significant than he initially thought. In a conference call Thursday, Mr. Heins acknowledged deep problems, and said he was open to considering a sale of the company if an ongoing strategic review determined that was the right approach, though that wasn't his first option. ""It is now very clear to me that substantial change is what RIM needs,"" he said in the call. When asked directly if he was considering a sale, he responded that ""if there is any element that we detected during that strategic review that would lead us into this direction, we would consider it. But it is not the main direction we're pursuing right now."" RIM said it reached 77 million total BlackBerry subscribers world-wide, but another quarter of falling shipments of the smartphone underscored the challenges ahead. Mr. Heins has said his turnaround plan hinges on a successful rollout this year of RIM's next-generation smartphone, the BlackBerry 10. He said Thursday that rollout was still on track for later this year. Analysts had expected another rough quarter, as RIM struggles with falling BlackBerry sales and a costly and so-far unsuccessful entry into the tablet market. But the high-level departures were a surprise. Mr. Heins said the company is looking for replacements for the two departing senior executives. He has also pledged to appoint a high-powered chief marketing officer. He said Thursday that search was ""going well."" RIM reported a loss of $125 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter. That is down from income of $934 million, or $1.78 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue was $4.19 billion, down about 25% from $5.56 billion in the same period last year. RIM said it shipped 11.1 million BlackBerrys in the quarter, down 21% from the previous quarter. After heavily discounting its PlayBook tablet, and taking a nearly half-billion dollar charge related to inventory buildup of the device last year, RIM said it had shipped 500,000 units. That is the best quarter for the tablet since the first three-month period immediately after its debut. RIM said Thursday it would no longer provide earnings guidance ""due to a desire to focus on long term value creation.""

201203,Research in Motion rises after announcing shift in business focus and management shakeup,"NEW YORK (AP) - Shares of Research in Motion Ltd. jumped Friday after the maker of BlackBerry smartphones said it is returning its focus to business customers and shaking up its management. The stock advanced 97 cents, or 7.1 percent, closing at $14.70, despite Thursday's disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report and announcement that RIM was withdrawing its financial guidance. The Canadian company said its phones proved less popular with consumers than iPhone and Android smartphones from other makers than it hoped. RIM also announced the departures of former longtime co-CEO Jim Balsillie from its board and of David Yach, its chief technology officer for software, and Jim Rowan, its chief operating officer for global operations. The company also said it is conducting a strategic review of its operations. Research in Motion's revenue of $4.2 billion was about $300 million lower than Wall Street expected, according to FactSet. But its adjusted earnings of 80 cents per share came in just a penny below what analysts were expecting. Analysts said Friday that in some ways the company's results were better than they could have been. Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said the weak revenue was ""widely expected,"" while the company's profit, service revenue and sales of BlackBerry devices were better than some had feared. He said the service revenue was ""surprisingly good."" JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna said the company's quarterly results ""were arguably better than worst-case fears"" and it was a good thing the company is restructuring and setting more reasonable expectations. ""New management now appears more candid about the challenges it faces and more open to creative strategic options than we have seen in the past,"" Gauna wrote. However he said the company ""desperately"" needs to get BlackBerry 10 launched before the end of the year. Wu rates RIM shares at ""neutral."" Gauna has a ""market underperform"" rating on them. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of (EURO)1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a (EURO)1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of (EURO)745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says net income fell 44 percent, while sales fell 7 percent in the first full quarter under new CEO Meg Whitman. Contributing factors included weak demand from consumers and the shortage in disk drives. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. reports strong earnings that validated its approach of delivering software and services over the Internet rather than on individual computers. Some of the initial enthusiasm cooled, though, after investors factored in growth from a change in billing frequency. March 19: Adobe Systems Inc. says its net income fell 21 percent, weighed by higher operating costs even as revenue climbed. Adobe booked $648 million in operating costs in the latest quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier due to higher sales, marketing and other expenses. March 20: Oracle Corp. says its earnings rose 18 percent despite meager revenue growth during the December-February quarter. If not for acquisition expenses and other costs, Oracle says it would have earned 62 cents per share, soundly exceeding the 56 cents expected by analysts. Thursday: Research in Motion Ltd. reports results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Adjusted income for the latest quarter was 80 cents per share, a penny short of expectations from analysts polled by FactSet. Revenue fell 25 percent to $4.2 billion from $5.6 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.5 billion. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc. Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says sales to consumers dropped 23 percent from a year earlier. HP is the world's largest maker of PCs, but it's been performing badly as buyers in the industrialized world are turning their attention to Apple's iPads and Macs. Meanwhile, it hasn't been able to capture the growing appetite for PCs in emerging markets. Revenue from commercial businesses fell 4 percent. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. says it closed four times the number of seven-figure deals in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In the current quarter, the company got its first nine-figure deal ever. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. says its profit sank 64 percent in its fourth quarter and gives a lackluster sales outlook. The company expects hard disk memory sales to bounce back as much as 20 percent, but anticipates wireless segment sales to decline sequentially in the current quarter due to seasonal factors. It also expects networking sales to be flat. Feb. 29: Microsoft begins letting consumers try out its upcoming touch-based Windows 8 operating system. It aims to power a new wave of tablet computers and traditional PCs designed to counter Apple's big gains in the market through its Macs and iPads. March 7: Apple announces a third version of its iPad. March 8: Chip-maker Texas Instruments lowers its first-quarter guidance, citing weakened demand for wireless products. Research firm Gartner forecasts that PC shipments will grow 4.4 percent worldwide this year after a small drop in 2011. That's relatively weak growth as consumer attention turns to tablets. March 20: Oracle Corp. says sales of new software licenses picked up in its latest quarter, helping to ease concerns about the company's future as it loses customers to rivals offering less expensive alternatives. Total revenue grew just 3 percent in the December-February period. But revenue from new software licenses went up 7 percent, helping to offset defections to companies that specialize in Internet-based software known as cloud computing. March 22: Memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc. reports a $224 million net loss in the quarter through March 1 as sales fell. The net loss came to 23 cents per share, larger than the 19 cents per share net loss expected by analysts polled by FactSet. Thursday: Micron adds to the net loss by $58 million after announcing a settlement with Oracle in a price-fixing case. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,BlackBerry Maker Posts Another Loss as a Former Chief Leaves Its Board,"OTTAWA — Research in Motion, the beleaguered BlackBerry maker, is open to selling or licensing parts of its business, its chief executive said Thursday after the company announced a fourth-quarter loss of $125 million and a higher-than-anticipated decline in BlackBerry sales. The financial results, which marked the fifth consecutive time that the company missed its quarterly financial guidance, were preceded by an announcement that Jim Balsillie, the company’s former co-chief executive and co-chairman, had resigned from the board. Although Thorsten Heins, the company’s chief executive since January, is an insider, in a conference call with analysts Thursday he adopted a much more candid tone about the company’s position than his predecessors have offered. “I recognize that these are difficult times for shareholders,” he said. “And it is likely that the next few quarters will be challenging.” Mr. Heins said that the company was currently reviewing its businesses as well as looking at a sweeping reorganization of its management. David Yach has stepped down as chief technology officer of software and Jim Rowan has left the post of chief operating officer for global operations. Mr. Heins said he had already decided that RIM should concentrate on selling to its original client base of business and government users. “It is very clear to me that substantial change is what RIM needs,” he said during the conference call. “We believe BlackBerry cannot succeed if we try to be everybody’s darling and all things to all people.” The review of operations, he said, would include exploring licensing RIM’s technologies to other companies or forming partnerships with other companies. If it makes good business sense, he added, some of RIM’s operations may be sold although he said that he intended to keep the company as an integrated provider of hardware, software and, through its unique network, data and communications services. About the only avenue that Mr. Heins appeared reluctant to follow was seeking a sale of RIM as a whole. “The best path for RIM is to manage the turnaround,” he said. The sweeping call for change from Mr. Heins was welcomed by many analysts. “That was an important step,” said Bill Kreher, a technology analyst at Edward Jones. “Heins appears to be more open to new ideas than the previous management team.” Nevertheless, like his predecessors, Mr. Heins is betting that RIM’s fortunes will reverse once a new line of phones using a new operating system, BlackBerry 10, starts coming to market later this year. While Mr. Heins still did not have a date for when those phones would go on sale, he did say that sample versions would be provided to software developers in May. During the fourth quarter of RIM’s fiscal year, which ended March 3, sales of BlackBerry 7 phones, which were supposed to bridge the gap to the new handsets, fell so much that RIM took a $267 million write-down on inventory. The company also wrote down the value of its good will by $355 million during the quarter. Without the charges, RIM would have earned $418 million, or 55 percent less than the $934 million recorded a year earlier. Revenue declined to $4.19 billion, from $5.56 billion during the period a year earlier. The 11.1 million BlackBerry phones shipped marked a 21 percent drop. The company shipped about 500,000 PlayBook tablets and said that retailers sold slightly more than that number during the quarter. Sales of the tablets, which use a preliminary form of the BlackBerry 10 operating system, have been fueled by prices that are below RIM’s cost for making the devices. Over the last 18 months or so, RIM had been able to more than offset the drastic decline in BlackBerry sales in the United States by successfully promoting inexpensive BlackBerrys in less developed countries as entry level smartphones. But Mr. Heins said that business was now under threat by increasing numbers of low-priced smartphones using Google’s Android operating system. RIM, he said, will soon introduce inexpensive handsets it hopes will counter that trend.

201203,Electronic Giant Vowing Reforms in China Plants,"Responding to a critical investigation of its factories, the manufacturing giant Foxconn has pledged to sharply curtail working hours and significantly increase wages inside Chinese plants making electronic products for Apple and others. The move could improve working conditions across China. The shift comes after a far-ranging inspection by the Fair Labor Association, a monitoring group, found widespread problems — including at least 43 violations of Chinese laws and regulations, and numerous instances where Foxconn defied industry codes of conduct by having employees work more than 60 hours a week, and sometimes more than 11 days in a row. The group released a report Thursday with its findings. The monitoring group, which surveyed more than 35,000 Foxconn employees and inspected three large facilities where Apple products are manufactured, also found that 43 percent of workers had experienced or witnessed accidents, and almost two-thirds said their compensation “does not meet their basic needs.” Many said that the unions available to them do “not provide true worker representation.” “There’s this lingering sense among workers that they’re in a dangerous place,” Auret van Heerden, president and chief executive of the Fair Labor Association, said in an interview. But Foxconn has “reached a tipping point,” he added. “They have publicly promised to make changes in a manner that they will have to deliver on it.” Apple, which recently joined the Fair Labor Association, had asked the group to investigate plants manufacturing iPhones, iPads and other devices. In past months, a growing outcry over conditions at such factories has drawn protests and petitions, and several labor rights organizations started independently scrutinizing Apple’s suppliers. Earlier this week a collection of advocacy groups sent Apple an open letter calling on the company to “ensure decent working conditions at all its suppliers.” Since January, Apple has released the names of 156 of its suppliers — which it had previously declined to identify — and has started posting regular monitoring reports on the number of hours worked by factory employees. Apple, which has audited its suppliers since 2006, said in a statement Thursday that it shares “the F.L.A.’s goal of improving lives and raising the bar for manufacturing companies everywhere.” Foxconn did not reveal how much it would raise wages or details on how its promises would be put into place. But the impact of Foxconn’s hour and wage reforms could signal a new, wide-reaching change in working conditions throughout China. Foxconn makes over 40 percent of the world’s electronics products — including for such brands as Amazon, Dell and Hewlett-Packard — and is China’s largest and most prominent private employer, with 1.2 million workers. In response to the report, Foxconn said it was “committed to work with Apple to carry out the remediation program, developed by both our companies.” Apple, in a statement, said the company fully supported the monitoring group’s recommendations. “Our team has been working for years to educate workers, improve conditions and make Apple’s supply chain a model for the industry, which is why we asked the F.L.A. to conduct these audits.” Foxconn’s promises include a commitment that by July of next year, no worker will labor for more than 49 hours per week — the limit set by Chinese law. Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, has also pledged that despite cutting hours, employees’ pay will not decline. Experts say such promises will most likely require Foxconn to hire tens of thousands of additional employees, which along with the wage increases could cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Those moves, in turn, are likely to influence the prices paid by Foxconn’s customers, and could increase the retail cost of consumer electronics products like smartphones and tablets unless Apple and others accept lower profit margins. “At the end of the day it’s a matter of image, a matter of recognition, a matter of reputation,” said Ricardo Ernst, a professor of global logistics at Georgetown University. But regardless of motivation, when a company as large as Foxconn changes, it reshapes other companies’ decisions, he added. This is not the first time that independent monitors have criticized conditions at Foxconn — or that change has been promised. In 2006, Apple said that Foxconn “has enacted a policy change to enforce the weekly overtime limits set by our Code of Conduct.” That change, however, did not bring Foxconn into line with the law or Apple’s regulations. Last year, Apple wrote in its yearly audit summary that “reducing excessive overtime is a top priority” in 2012. This year, the company began weekly tracking of 110 facilities — including Foxconn — where excessive work-hour violations were commonplace. Last month, according to that tracking, the average employee worked 48 hours, and 89 percent of monitored employees worked 60 hours or less per week, which is the limit mandated in most circumstances by Apple’s supplier code of conduct. “It is not news that Apple and Foxconn are promising to end labor rights abuses at these factories,” said Scott Nova, executive director of the Workers Rights Consortium, a university-backed monitoring group based in Washington. “They have been promising to do that since 2006. And they have not delivered. I hope this time will be different.” Mr. van Heerden of the Fair Labor Association said he believed this time the promised changes would occur because his organization would continue monitoring Foxconn and because worldwide attention was focused on the issue more sharply than ever. “I think they have crossed the Rubicon,” he said, of Foxconn and its chief executive, Terry Gou. “He’d be crazy to make these commitments without fulfilling them,” he added. In the extensive report documenting its findings, the Fair Labor Association said a majority or near majority of workers surveyed said they felt pain after working a full day, that wages were not sufficient to pay for health care or education and that dorms were crowded. But the group’s surveys found that not all employees had complaints or objected to long hours. Some wanted to work more to earn more money. Foxconn workers at one plant start at about $285 a month, and average wages are about $426 to $455 per month, according to the group’s report. Many of the group’s findings align with what Apple has found in the audits the company performs, said Mr. van Heerden. But the group’s findings that unions and other worker representation groups are dominated by nominees chosen by management contradict Apple’s reports that most factories allow free association among workers. The association’s findings also strongly contradict Foxconn’s statement, sent earlier this year to The New York Times, that workers generally “are limited to no more than 60 hours per week.” Among other things, the group found that Foxconn in the past prepped workers with answers to give to monitors to avoid detection of violations. “We found a cheat sheet,” said Mr. van Heerden. “If you’re asked how many hours you work, say this, for instance. Since we’re not asking the questions that conventional auditors ask, we were able to see what’s really going on.” The association will soon begin inspecting other companies in Apple’s supply chain, said Mr. van Heerden.

201203,Millennial Shares Have Strong First Day,"The market for initial public stock offerings is riding high as another company has soared in its first day of trading. On Thursday, shares of Millennial Media, a mobile advertising company, closed at $25, nearly double its initial offering price of $13. Millennial's results came a day after the strong debut of Annie's, the organic food maker, whose shares rose 64 percent on Wednesday, their first day of trading. Shares in Annie's, based in Berkeley, Calif., rose an additional 5.6 percent on Thursday, to $37.92. Since the beginning of the year, about 85 percent of all offerings in the United States have risen above their initial offering price, according to Renaissance Capital, a research firm. A quarter have increased more than 50 percent from that initial level. The recent results suggest that the market for newly public companies is returning to life after a period of weakness. Investors, eagerly awaiting the debut of the social network Facebook, are pouring their money into smaller offerings in the meantime. ''There's hardly been a deal that has not worked since February,'' said Scott Sweet, a managing partner of IPOboutique.com. ''The I.P.O. market is more frothy now.'' Technology is among the most attractive areas. Millenial's market debut was the strongest for a tech company since LinkedIn went public in May. Its stock performance on Thursday showed investors' desire to tap into the growing use of smartphones like iPhones and Android devices. Investors also do not seem deterred by potential red flags. Rexnord, which went public on Thursday, is using proceeds from its stock sale to pay down as much as $300 million in debt. Investors have sometimes shied away from such offerings, wary of buying into a company with a hefty debt load that needs to be paid down. But Rexnord and Allison Transmission, a vehicle parts maker owned by the Carlyle Group and Onex, which went public on March 15, have remained above their offering prices. Still, the strong performances of companies this week is only starting to make up for the initial public offering drought. Over the last year, the number of global initial offerings is down more than half, to 45, according to Renaissance data. Investors are still being discerning. Shares in CafePress, an e-commerce specialist that personalizes merchandise like T-shirts, closed at $19.03 on Thursday, only three cents above its initial offering price. Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, which specializes in cancer treatments, tumbled 13.7 percent in its debut on Thursday, closing at $6.04. Not all companies that went public this week had substantial jumps in stock price, however. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

201203,BlackBerry Maker Posts Another Loss as a Former Chief Leaves Its Board,"OTTAWA -- Research in Motion, the beleaguered BlackBerry maker, is open to selling or licensing parts of its business, its chief executive said Thursday after the company announced a fourth-quarter loss of $125 million and a higher-than-anticipated decline in BlackBerry sales. The financial results, which marked the fifth consecutive time that the company missed its quarterly financial guidance, were preceded by an announcement that Jim Balsillie, the company's former co-chief executive and co-chairman, had resigned from the board. Although Thorsten Heins, the company's chief executive since January, is an insider, in a conference call with analysts Thursday he adopted a much more candid tone about the company's position than his predecessors have offered. ''I recognize that these are difficult times for shareholders,'' he said. ''And it is likely that the next few quarters will be challenging.'' Mr. Heins said that the company was currently reviewing its businesses as well as looking at a sweeping reorganization of its management. David Yach has stepped down as chief technology officer of software and Jim Rowan has left the post of chief operating officer for global operations. Mr. Heins said he had already decided that RIM should concentrate on selling to its original client base of business and government users. ''It is very clear to me that substantial change is what RIM needs,'' he said during the conference call. ''We believe BlackBerry cannot succeed if we try to be everybody's darling and all things to all people.'' The review of operations, he said, would include exploring licensing RIM's technologies to other companies or forming partnerships with other companies. If it makes good business sense, he added, some of RIM's operations may be sold although he said that he intended to keep the company as an integrated provider of hardware, software and, through its unique network, data and communications services. About the only avenue that Mr. Heins appeared reluctant to follow was seeking a sale of RIM as a whole. ''The best path for RIM is to manage the turnaround,'' he said. The sweeping call for change from Mr. Heins was welcomed by many analysts. ''That was an important step,'' said Bill Kreher, a technology analyst at Edward Jones. ''Heins appears to be more open to new ideas than the previous management team.'' Nevertheless, like his predecessors, Mr. Heins is betting that RIM's fortunes will reverse once a new line of phones using a new operating system, BlackBerry 10, starts coming to market later this year. While Mr. Heins still did not have a date for when those phones would go on sale, he did say that sample versions would be provided to software developers in May. During the fourth quarter of RIM's fiscal year, which ended March 3, sales of BlackBerry 7 phones, which were supposed to bridge the gap to the new handsets, fell so much that RIM took a $267 million write-down on inventory. The company also wrote down the value of its good will by $355 million during the quarter. Without the charges, RIM would have earned $418 million, or 55 percent less than the $934 million recorded a year earlier. Revenue declined to $4.19 billion, from $5.56 billion during the period a year earlier. The 11.1 million BlackBerry phones shipped marked a 21 percent drop. The company shipped about 500,000 PlayBook tablets and said that retailers sold slightly more than that number during the quarter. Sales of the tablets, which use a preliminary form of the BlackBerry 10 operating system, have been fueled by prices that are below RIM's cost for making the devices. Over the last 18 months or so, RIM had been able to more than offset the drastic decline in BlackBerry sales in the United States by successfully promoting inexpensive BlackBerrys in less developed countries as entry level smartphones. But Mr. Heins said that business was now under threat by increasing numbers of low-priced smartphones using Google's Android operating system. RIM, he said, will soon introduce inexpensive handsets it hopes will counter that trend.

201203,Electronic Giant Vowing Reforms In China Plants,"Responding to a critical investigation of its factories, the manufacturing giant Foxconn has pledged to sharply curtail working hours and significantly increase wages inside Chinese plants making electronic products for Apple and others. The move could improve working conditions across China. The shift comes after a far-ranging inspection by the Fair Labor Association, a monitoring group, found widespread problems -- including at least 43 violations of Chinese laws and regulations, and numerous instances where Foxconn defied industry codes of conduct by having employees work more than 60 hours a week, and sometimes more than 11 days in a row. The group released a report Thursday with its findings. The monitoring group, which surveyed more than 35,000 Foxconn employees and inspected three large facilities where Apple products are manufactured, also found that 43 percent of workers had experienced or witnessed accidents, and almost two-thirds said their compensation ''does not meet their basic needs.'' Many said that the unions available to them do ''not provide true worker representation.'' ''There's this lingering sense among workers that they're in a dangerous place,'' Auret van Heerden, president and chief executive of the Fair Labor Association, said in an interview. But Foxconn has ''reached a tipping point,'' he added. ''They have publicly promised to make changes in a manner that they will have to deliver on it.'' Apple, which recently joined the Fair Labor Association, had asked the group to investigate plants manufacturing iPhones, iPads and other devices. In past months, a growing outcry over conditions at such factories has drawn protests and petitions, and several labor rights organizations started independently scrutinizing Apple's suppliers. Earlier this week a collection of advocacy groups sent Apple an open letter calling on the company to ''ensure decent working conditions at all its suppliers.'' Since January, Apple has released the names of 156 of its suppliers -- which it had previously declined to identify -- and has started posting regular monitoring reports on the number of hours worked by factory employees. Apple, which has audited its suppliers since 2006, said in a statement Thursday that it shares ''the F.L.A.'s goal of improving lives and raising the bar for manufacturing companies everywhere.'' Foxconn did not reveal how much it would raise wages or details on how its promises would be put into place. But the impact of Foxconn's hour and wage reforms could signal a new, wide-reaching change in working conditions throughout China. Foxconn makes over 40 percent of the world's electronics products -- including for such brands as Amazon, Dell and Hewlett-Packard -- and is China's largest and most prominent private employer, with 1.2 million workers. In response to the report, Foxconn said it was ''committed to work with Apple to carry out the remediation program, developed by both our companies.'' Apple, in a statement, said the company fully supported the monitoring group's recommendations. ''Our team has been working for years to educate workers, improve conditions and make Apple's supply chain a model for the industry, which is why we asked the F.L.A. to conduct these audits.'' Foxconn's promises include a commitment that by July of next year, no worker will labor for more than 49 hours per week -- the limit set by Chinese law. Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, has also pledged that despite cutting hours, employees' pay will not decline. Experts say such promises will most likely require Foxconn to hire tens of thousands of additional employees, which along with the wage increases could cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Those moves, in turn, are likely to influence the prices paid by Foxconn's customers, and could increase the retail cost of consumer electronics products like smartphones and tablets unless Apple and others accept lower profit margins. ''At the end of the day it's a matter of image, a matter of recognition, a matter of reputation,'' said Ricardo Ernst, a professor of global logistics at Georgetown University. But regardless of motivation, when a company as large as Foxconn changes, it reshapes other companies' decisions, he added. This is not the first time that independent monitors have criticized conditions at Foxconn -- or that change has been promised. In 2006, Apple said that Foxconn ''has enacted a policy change to enforce the weekly overtime limits set by our Code of Conduct.'' That change, however, did not bring Foxconn into line with the law or Apple's regulations.

201203,"For Struggling RIM, Sale Prospects Appear Tough","It took an awful quarter for Research in Motion to acknowledge on Thursday that it needed to explore ""strategic opportunities,"" something the BlackBerry maker scoffed at even two months ago. But even if RIM pursues some sort of sale, it's not clear that it would fetch a substantial sum. In announcing a $125 million loss and another quarter of declining sales, RIM conceded in a statement that it needed to consider possible joint ventures or partnerships. Its chief executive of two months, Thorsten Heins, was even more candid in an analyst call, saying that he will ""leave no stone unturned"" in an effort to generate better returns for shareholders. That is a marked change from his first call with analysts in January, where he insisted, ""I don't think there is some drastic change needed."" Mr. Heins said that he would even entertain a potential deal for the whole company, though he added: ""It is not the main direction we're pursuing right now."" The term ""strategic opportunities"" (or its more common cousin, ""strategic alternatives"") is usually thinly veiled code for ""exploring a potential sale."" RIM has been the subject of takeover speculation before, with Microsoft, Amazon.com and Nokia having been mentioned as having dallied with the prospects of making a bid. With a market value of $7.3 billion as of Friday, RIM remains a big target for an acquirer to swallow. But it's only a fraction of the $29.4 billion that the company was worth just one year ago. RIM's value can generally be broken down into four areas: its hardware business; its vast network operating center, which processes the e-mails at the heart of its business; its messaging services; and its trove of smartphone and e-mail patents. But even if RIM were to sell itself or parts, analysts and bankers think that the company may not fetch what it could have a year ago. Earlier this week, Brian Blair, an analyst at Wedge Securities, declared flatly in a research note that he did not see a deal opportunity in the near term ""because we don't believe RIM has much to offer."" According to Mr. Blair, the company's network operating center, which provides RIM's vaunted encryption, has lost its allure, as enterprise and government customers increasingly accept the more limited security offered by the iPhone and Android devices. RIM's hardware manufacturing business doesn't hold much attraction for potential buyers either. Nor does the company's BlackBerry operating system, which is set to be upgraded to BlackBerry 10 this year. On the software side, RIM has struggled to draw developers into creating apps for its system instead of iOS and Android. And Microsoft is making a heavy push for its own Windows Phone operating system. Mr. Blair writes that even Amazon.com, which could have used a proprietary operating system for its Kindle Fire line of tablets, has opted for Android. And Samsung, a heavyweight phone manufacturer whose wares use both Android and Windows Phone, may not have much interest. That leaves RIM's hoard of wireless and messaging patents, which analysts, including Mr. Blair, say have real value. Few areas have garnered more attention -- or legal fees -- in the technology world over the last year than intellectual property, as companies have raced to defend their products by buying up patents. Google's $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility was prompted by such a concern. So too was the $4.5 billion sale of Nortel wireless patents to a group of companies that included, yes, RIM. Yet even there, others disagree about the worth of RIM's holdings. Last September, analysts at Jefferies wrote that the company would fetch only about $2.5 billion if it sold its portfolio in its entirety. Should the company decide to sell the patents but continue making BlackBerrys, necessitating cross-licensing deals with eventual buyers, it would reap only about $1 billion. All this leaves aside another consideration for a potential acquirer: government interference. RIM is one of Canada's most prominent homegrown companies, whose meteoric rise to smartphone superpower is a matter of national pride. Stephen Harper, the country's prime minister, has declared RIM ""an important Canadian company."" And the importance of RIM's security protocols to the United States government, a major customer of BlackBerrys, could exclude Chinese manufacturers from the universe of buyers. In any case, Mr. Heins is hoping that he has bought himself and his company some time. Shares in RIM were up about 1.5 percent in midmorning trading on Friday, at $13.93. They have plummeted 75.5 percent over the last year. * Quest for Patents Brings New Focus in Tech Deals * Apps Boom as Companies Seek a Place on Your Phone The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120330e83u0038q ",NYT Blogs,30 March 2012,820 words,struggling rim sale prospect appear tough,took awful quarter research motion acknowledge thursday needed strategic opportunity something blackberry maker scoffed even two month ago rim pursues sort sale clear fetch substantial sum announcing million loss another declining conceded statement possible joint venture partnership chief executive thorsten heins candid analyst call saying leave stone unturned effort generate better shareholder marked change first january insisted dont think drastic mr heins said entertain whole company though added direction pursuing term common cousin alternative usually thinly veiled code exploring subject takeover microsoft amazoncom nokia mentioned dallied prospect making market value friday remains big target acquirer swallow fraction worth one year generally broken four area hardware business vast network operating process email messaging service trove smartphone patent sell banker may earlier week brian blair wedge security declared flatly see dont much offer according mr blair provides vaunted encryption lost allure enterprise government customer increasingly limited offered iphone android device manufacturing doesnt attraction buyer either system upgraded software side struggled developer creating apps instead io microsoft push window mr blair writes amazoncom used proprietary kindle tablet opted samsung heavyweight whose ware interest leaf hoard wireless including mr blair garnered attention legal fee technology world last intellectual property raced defend buying google motorola mobility prompted nortel group included yes others disagree september jefferies wrote sold portfolio entirety decide necessitating crosslicensing eventual reap aside consideration interference canada homegrown whose meteoric rise smartphone superpower pride stephen harper prime minister important canadian importance protocol united major exclude chinese mr heins hoping bought time share percent midmorning trading friday plummeted quest brings new tech apps boom seek york document nytbeuq
201203,RIM Weighs Bleak Options,"Research In Motion Ltd.'s new chief executive faces two bleak options: Attempt a bold turnaround of the embattled BlackBerry maker, or find a willing buyer. Neither will be an easy task. RIM said sales of BlackBerrys fell sharply in the latest quarter, leading to the company's first revenue decline in seven years. Its subscriber growth rate from the previous quarter also hit an all-time low of 3%. And two of RIM's top officers stepped down, leaving RIM's executive bench as shallow as it has ever been. Meanwhile, morale has flagged amid the unrest, according to executives inside and outside the company. At a dinner meeting in February between RIM's chief technology officer, David Yach, one of the executives who left Thursday, and chief information officers from companies and government agencies, including the Department of Defense, the mood from the RIM side was somber, according to a person who attended the dinner. ""It was like going to a wake,"" this person said. A RIM spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Yach was at the meeting, but said she was unable to confirm the details. The turmoil has ratcheted up pressure on RIM's rookie CEO, Thorsten Heins, to execute flawlessly on what will be the company's most important product launch, the new BlackBerry 10 operating system. Mr. Heins said Thursday RIM is still planning to roll out new BlackBerry smartphones later this year. But RIM also said it was conducting a ""comprehensive review of strategic opportunities."" Mr. Heins, asked specifically about a sale, didn't rule it out. RIM hasn't actively sought financial advice on its options yet and may not go down the path of a sale at all, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Mr. Heins' willingness to consider a wider range of options than his predecessors gave RIM shares a lift on Friday. The stock gained 7% to $14.70 in New York. In an address to RIM employees Friday morning, Mr. Heins said the company would be run as a ""leaner"" ship going forward, but didn't warn of additional layoffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Heins also hasn't yet appointed a chief marketing officer, one of his first pledges after succeeding former co-chiefs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis earlier this year. At a time of distress, he will also now need to recruit executives to fill the CTO and chief operating officer positions. As long as the odds of a turnaround seem, a sale isn't a sure thing either. The company's market capitalization hovers over $7 billion, a big bite for any buyer to swallow. Some bankers said there would be few buyers at that price tag for the whole company. The exception would be giants like Microsoft Corp. andNokia Corp. The two explored a joint bid for RIM last year, according to people familiar with the situation, but those talks were preliminary and didn't lead to a bid. Nokia has adopted Microsoft's operating system for its latest smart phones. Given that close partnership, the two could make a coordinated approach, if they decided to bid, according to people familiar with the situation. If they jointly bid, the two companies would likely scrap RIM's mobile operating system and instead equip BlackBerrys with Microsoft's Windows software, with Microsoft taking over RIM's enterprise network, these people said. RIM says it doesn't comment on rumors and speculation. If RIM's market cap continues shrinking, some bankers and analysts said RIM could get small enough for someone to buy the company just for its patents. Among the most valuable are its patents around security. Should RIM decide to put its intellectual property portfolio up for sale, there could be several potential buyers. Still, even the enterprise business is under long-term threat as corporate customers offer employees the option of using devices other than BlackBerrys for work. Technology and telecommunications companies have sought to beef up their patent holdings in recent years to protect themselves from lawsuits alleging patent infringement. As a result, many companies, including AOL Inc., are exploring potential divestitures of their technology patents. A key challenge for a foreign buyer could be the Canadian government, which requires that foreign companies demonstrate a ""net benefit"" to Canada in any big takeover deal. A foreign buyer may be more palatable if it teamed up with a Canadian company. Legal experts say a buyer could also make promises to keep the headquarters or a large number of employees in Ontario. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said he hopes to see RIM grow as a ""Canadian company,"" a phrase Canada's finance minister repeated to reporters Friday. But Finance Minister Jim Flaherty also said RIM ""will be masters of their own universe."" Even companies from countries with strong ties with Canada, such as Microsoft, would face scrutiny. Canadian officials would likely weigh national security concerns alongside economic ones. In 2008, the Canadian government rejected New Jersey-based Alliant Techsystems Inc.'s $1.3 billion bid for MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.'s satellite business. A sale isn't the only strategic option RIM has. As part of its review, RIM itself might decide to close parts of its business to focus on its few remaining strengths, though no decisions have been made, a person familiar with the company's thinking said. The handset business, for instance, has been hurt by competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhones and Android-based phones that have features customers want, and RIM could decide to pull out of it entirely to focus on its core enterprise network assets, which include the networks over which emails get sent, some people said. Last year, the company had received queries from financial investors, including sovereign wealth and pension funds, offering to put in cash in exchange for a minority stake, but RIM turned down those offers, according to people familiar with the matter. These people said it was possible such efforts could be revived. Anton Troianovski contributed to this article.

201203,Time to Catch a Falling BlackBerry?,"Research In Motion has finally issued a call for help. With the business in free-fall, it makes little sense for an acquirer to answer. Yet that is the bet being made by the BlackBerry maker's investors. Despite very weak financial results for the most recent quarter, shares jumped 7.1% Friday after CEO Thorsten Heins said he is willing to sell the company. Mr. Heins has changed his tune drastically since taking over 10 weeks ago. Then, he expressed optimism about the company's prospects, claiming a new marketing strategy could help turn RIM around. But it was always difficult to believe that a new slogan could help sell outmoded smartphones. The question is whether a potential acquirer like Microsoft will want to catch a falling knife. RIM's smartphone shipments fell 26% last quarter from the same period a year ago. The company acknowledges that it has no high-end products to compete with devices like Apple's iPhone or the Samsung Galaxy, and it is being forced to lower prices for its devices as it increasingly fights for share at the low end of the market. Sales in international markets had been a bright spot, with the BlackBerry serving as a solid entry-level smartphone. Yet that success is now being undercut by rivals that are offering cheaper handsets to steal RIM's market share. According to estimates from Strategy Analytics, RIM had 14.5% share of the global smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2010. That fell to 8.5% a year later, and Strategy Analytics sees it falling to 7% in the first quarter of this year. And as BlackBerry handset sales plunge, that puts at risk high-margin subscription fees RIM generates by delivering email via its proprietary network of servers. At about 77 million, the number of subscribers grew only 3% or so in the most recent quarter compared with the prior one. A year ago, the subscriber base was still growing quickly. And any growth from here is expected to come internationally, from lower-priced subscription plans. Might an acquirer simply shut down the bleeding handset business and milk the network business for cash? Not likely. Severance and other costs would make that expensive. Never mind the backlash in Canada, where RIM is still seen as a source of national pride. On its present course, RIM risks becoming another handset flameout like Palm. The hand-held pioneer was eventually bought by Hewlett-Packard when on its last legs in 2010. Soberingly, for any daring wannabe RIM acquirers, Palm's handset business was closed soon after anyway. RIM still has hope that a new operating system, known as BlackBerry 10, will save the company. Yet sales of tablets sporting the operating system have disappointed. And smartphones based on it aren't expected to ship until later this year, when they are likely to be competing with a new iPhone model from Apple. RIM may look cheap, but it is likely to get cheaper. Write to Rolfe Winkler at rolfe.winkler@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Google Heightens Rivalry With iPad,"Google Inc., undaunted by a short-lived attempt to market and sell smartphones on its own, is now trying the approach with tablet computers in a quest to capture market share from Apple Inc.'s iPad. The Internet search company will sell co-branded tablets directly to consumers through an online store like rivals Apple and Amazon.com Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The move is an effort to turn around sluggish sales of tablet computers powered by Google's Android software. Google went this route with Android-powered smartphones in 2010 when it offered a device called the Nexus One made by HTC Corp. But the effort was scrapped after several months amid better sales of other Android-powered smartphones. Like the Nexus One, some future Android tablets are expected to be co-branded with Google's name, said people familiar with the matter. The company is expected to sell devices from a variety of manufacturers. Google won't make the devices and its existing partners such as Samsung Electronics Co. and AsusTeK Computer Inc. will be responsible for the hardware, these people said. One co-branded tablet that may be sold in the online store is due to be released later this year by Taiwan-based Asus, said one of these people. Details of the project remain unclear, including when Google plans to unveil the online store. Google is expected to release the next version of its Android software, called Jelly Bean, in the middle of this year, people familiar with the matter have said. Google will soon manufacture its own tablets, due to its pending $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., which has been approved in the U.S. and in Europe and is awaiting approval by Chinese authorities. People familiar with the Google's plans said Motorola tablets are expected to be offered in the online store. A Google spokesman declined to comment, as did an Asus spokeswoman. By selling tablets directly to consumers, Google is upping the ante against Apple, which debuted its market-leading iPad two years ago. Android-based tablets made by Samsung and others have been slow sellers by comparison. Last fall research firm Gartner estimated Apple would capture 73% of the tablet market versus 17% for Android. Google also faces competition from Amazon.com, which last year jumped into tablets with its $199 Kindle Fire, in a move to scoop up the less-expensive side of the market. Google is seeking to increase adoption of its Android software so that its search, maps and other services—which generate the vast majority of its mobile revenue through the sale of ads—become mainstays in the mobile-device world. While that revenue is small compared to PC-based ad sales, it's a fast-growing category for Google, and tablets can command better ad prices than smartphones. Google Chief Executive Larry Page said last fall the company was on pace to generate more than $2.5 billion in revenue from mobile devices, largely through selling online ads on smartphones. Google believes the current model for selling tablets is broken, said people familiar with its strategy. Google has watched as wireless carriers, who helped Android become the No. 1 mobile operating system for smartphones, have struggled to replicate that success with tablets. While some wireless industry executives said Google's Nexus One smartphone effort was a failure, Google Android chief Andy Rubin said previously that the company sold more than 100,000 of these phones in three months and ""broke even"" on its investment. Mr. Rubin said Google stopped the effort because other new Android-powered phones were on par with or better than the Nexus One. Google also couldn't figure out how to sell the Nexus One online on a global scale, he said, and its resources would be wasted in trying to line up wireless carriers in foreign countries to sell plans for the phone. This time, however, Google won't have to worry about pairing with wireless carriers because tablets are primarily used with WiFi connections in people's homes. To boost the prospects of its new online tablet store, Google was considering subsidizing the cost of future tablets in order to compete on pricing with Amazon's Kindle Fire, said one person with knowledge of the effort. In addition, Google will lend huge marketing support to the online tablet store, said people familiar with the effort. Since the Nexus One experiment, Google has honed its mass-marketing skills, spending heavily on TV ads and other marketing to promote services other than its Web-search engine. The first tablet running Android software optimized for tablets, Motorola's Xoom, went on sale in February 2011, nearly 11 months after the first iPad arrived. Motorola has said it sold about one million Xoom tablets in 2011, below its expectations. Several other Android-powered tablets, including two versions of Dell Inc.'s Streak tablets, have been discontinued. Other manufacturers have noted the disappointing results. ""Honestly, we're not doing very well in the tablet market,"" Hankil Yoon, a product strategy executive for Samsung, said at the Mobile World Congress conference earlier this year. Physical stores will still remain an important sales channel for Google. Some U.S. retailers are anxious for an Apple rival to emerge in the market, said people familiar with the matter. Some retailers that sell iPads have chafed under Apple's rules that require stores to promote its products more prominently, these people said, and the retailers generate less revenue per sale of Apple products versus other electronic devices. Google has taken other steps to be a consumer electronics brand. The company is directly overseeing the manufacturing of a Google-branded music and video streaming device, to be used in people's homes, which it is expected to sell to consumers later this year, people familiar with the matter have said. It is unclear whether Google will offer the device as part of its new online store. Write to Amir Efrati at amir.efrati@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,"BlackBerry Maker in Turmoil; RIM Weighs Sale, Other Options as Top Executives Leave; Reversal for New CEO","TORONTO—The new chief executive of BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. is overhauling the company's executive ranks and exploring strategic options, including a sale of the struggling smartphone pioneer. The changes include the exit of longtime executive Jim Balsillie, who had presided over RIM's rise and steep fall. Mr. Balsillie, who until earlier this year was co-CEO, resigned his board seat and is parting ways with a company he helped run for 20 years. The overhaul comes just two months after Thorsten Heins took the reins at RIM and confidently proclaimed there was no need for ""seismic"" change. But with the company's sales tumbling 25% in the latest quarter, new BlackBerrys piling up unsold and a crucial lineup of new devices still not expected to arrive until later this year, Mr. Heins is taking more drastic actions. RIM will back out of its high-profile attempt to win business among consumers to focus on its core corporate customers. The company also said its chief operating officer, Jim Rowan, and its chief technology officer, David Yach, would be leaving. The moves are an attempt to ensure the survival of the Canadian company as it makes an effort to catch up with rivals like Apple Inc. and Google Inc. that are winning away its customers at an accelerating pace. Technology bankers say the field of potential buyers for the entire company is limited, although there could be buyers for parts of its business, such as its software assets, its network, and its portfolio of patents related to wireless technology. Last year, Microsoft Corp. and Nokia Corp. discussed making a joint bid for RIM, people familiar with the matter said, but those talks were very preliminary. Microsoft, which already has partnerships with RIM, has long been considered a suitor. Analysts have said a deal would give Microsoft a foothold in the handsets market. Still, Microsoft has not made a public move and could be waiting for RIM's stock to get even cheaper before it decides to pursue a deal. Microsoft declined to comment. Messrs. Balsillie, Rowan and Yach also couldn't be reached. RIM shares have lost about 75% of their value in the past year. In after-hours trading Thursday, RIM was down 28 cents, or 2%, to $13.45, after closing at $13.73 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. A key challenge for any potential buyer could be the Canadian government. Despite its troubles, RIM is seen as a source of national pride. It is also a large employer in Waterloo, Ontario, where it is based. After the bankruptcy of another Canadian company, Nortel Networks Corp., in 2009, Canadian officials had touted the country still had RIM. RIM popularized mobile email, and its devices were once a badge of success in the corporate world. But companies and even governments have moved rapidly away from RIM, which was outsold by Apple's iPhone last year even in its home market of Canada. The damage was evident in RIM's fourth quarter, which ended March 3. Revenue dropped by 25% from the same quarter a year earlier, and the company said it would write off $267 million worth of unsold BlackBerry 7 models, its newest device. Apple, by contrast, saw its sales rise 73% in the three months through December. Mr. Heins warned the pain isn't over and the company's sales and profit will be under pressure for the next year. The new CEO said he is confident the company has valuable assets and good prospects, but said its turnaround will be risky and that he needs to hedge its bets, including by considering tie-ups with bigger partners. In the past, Mr. Heins has signaled he wasn't interested in selling the company. But after two months on the job, Mr. Heins said he realized the challenges facing the company are much more significant than he initially thought. In a conference call Thursday, Mr. Heins acknowledged deep problems, and said he was open to considering a sale of the company if an ongoing strategic review determined that was the right approach, though that wasn't his first option. ""It is now very clear to me that substantial change is what RIM needs,"" he said in the call. When asked directly if he was considering a sale, he responded that ""if there is any element that we detected during that strategic review that would lead us into this direction, we would consider it. But it is not the main direction we're pursuing right now."" RIM said it reached 77 million total BlackBerry subscribers world-wide, but another quarter of falling shipments of the smartphone underscored the challenges ahead. Mr. Heins has said his turnaround plan hinges on a successful rollout this year of RIM's next-generation smartphone, the BlackBerry 10. He said Thursday that rollout was still on track for later this year. Analysts had expected another rough quarter, as RIM struggles with falling BlackBerry sales and a costly and so-far unsuccessful entry into the tablet market. But the high-level departures were a surprise. Mr. Heins said the company is looking for replacements for the two departing senior executives. He has also pledged to appoint a high-powered chief marketing officer. He said Thursday that search was ""going well."" RIM reported a loss of $125 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter. That is down from income of $934 million, or $1.78 a share, in the year-earlier period. RIM said it would take a non-cash, goodwill charge of $355 million.Revenue was $4.19 billion, down about 25% from $5.56 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes one-time gains or losses including the good-will impairment, was 80 cents, below a consensus forecast of 81 cents a share, compiled by Thomson Reuters. RIM said it shipped 11.1 million BlackBerrys in the quarter, down 21% from the previous quarter. After heavily discounting its PlayBook tablet, and taking a nearly half-billion dollar charge related to inventory buildup of the device last year, RIM said it had shipped 500,000 units. That is the best quarter for the tablet since the first three-month period immediately after its debut. RIM said Thursday it would no longer provide earnings guidance ""due to a desire to focus on long term value creation."" Mr. Heins took over from former chiefs Mr. Balsillie and RIM co-founder Mike Lazaridis in January after months of investor pressure for a board shake-up.

201203,UPDATE 1-ANALYSIS-RIM CEO's brave face masks limited options,"* Rivals seen unlikely to license RIM software * Network could generate interest, but at what price? * Hardware exit would shrink company massively * Sale of RIM not in the cards now - sources * Stock rises 8 pct as investors cheerd by new CEO (Adds Breakingviews link, RIM declines comment, updates share price) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, March 30 (Reuters) - A candid diagnosis of the troubles facing Research In Motion delivered by freshman Chief Executive Thorsten Heins was a welcome change for its stakeholders, but his prescription for returning the BlackBerry maker to health might be hard to swallow. RIM recorded its first quarterly loss in seven years on Thursday and said it would no longer issue financial forecasts. A prolonged slump in sales of its smartphones shows no signs of abating, it said, at least until it can launch its next-generation line-up later this year. Heins, saying RIM could not be ""all things to all people,"" laid out a broad plan to bring in partners to help RIM plug the BlackBerry's weaknesses in consumer features such as music and video. RIM will also seek deals to license its software and highly secure network to other providers. He even said he might consider selling the company - once the pride of Canada - if the review pointed in that direction. But his options, which might also include scaling back or exiting the hardware business entirely, are either hugely disruptive to the company, unlikely to happen, or both. Still, investors seemed cheered by the straight talk, pushing its battered shares up almost 8 percent on Friday. That gave the stock some breathing room from its lowest in about eight years. It had dropped nearly 80 percent since February 2011. For now, talk of a sale is premature. RIM has avoided any discussions with potential suitors since a management and board shuffle in January put Heins in charge, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. ""They are not having any dialogue with private equity or strategics,"" one source said. The board, and in particular its newest member, value investor Prem Watsa, preferred to give Heins some time to turn things around, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussion were private. ""Prem Watsa is really very influential there now,"" the source said. ""They want to give (Heins) the opportunity to keep his head down and focus on the business."" Watsa, known for big bets on what he considers downtrodden stocks, joined RIM's board in January after building a stake he has since doubled, making his Fairfax Financial Holdings the second-largest RIM investor behind Primecap Management Co. A RIM spokeswoman declined to expand on the remarks Heins made on Thursday. RIM sees a savior on the horizon in the BlackBerry 10, which uses a different platform than the one that powers its legacy BlackBerry phones. But BlackBerry 10 hardware won't arrive until late in the year if RIM sticks to its schedule, and the competitive threats Heins alluded to in his Thursday conference call will likely have accelerated by then, leaving RIM further behind. Ambitious handset makers such as HTC and Huawei may have an interest in licensing BlackBerry software to enhance their credentials for providing secure email to businesses and government agencies, said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics. But he sees only a limited appetite for striking a partnership with the struggling brand. ""CATCH A FALLING KNIFE"" Major deals are unlikely before the launch of BlackBerry 10, he said. ""Potential partners or investors may want to know if the knife has stopped falling before they try to catch it."" It's not like RIM is in a strong negotiating position, with Google giving away its Android system, and Microsoft also in the mix with its revamped mobile software and dominance of office desktops. ""Coming to terms on the price will be challenging,"" said Alex Gauna from JMP Securities. Given RIM's history of lagging the industry on getting the latest hardware specifications into its devices, outsourcing RIM's manufacturing to a fast mover such as Samsung would make sense, analysts say. Such a move would result in a wholesale shrinking of RIM's workforce and cut out roughly 80 percent of its revenues, though it would also discard its most costly activities and drive its asking price down to a more attractive level. Finally, RIM could offer up use of its proprietary network which compresses and encrypts data sent from its BlackBerry devices, useful in emerging economies where bandwidth is limited. But RIM may put too high a price on what it sees as its crown jewel. ""The value of that enterprise suite is questionable,"" Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said in a phone interview. ""If it was so good, the company would be doing a lot better."" TAKEOVER COULD FACE POLITICAL OBSTACLE In the meantime, RIM is likely to have a tough time selling existing products. The company took a $267 million charge to write down the value of its BlackBerry 7 devices, which only launched in August. That suggests RIM has already started selling them below the cost of production or plans to do so. Even with the smartphone market in the middle of a boom, RIM's volumes over the next year could actually drop 25 percent, Credit Suisse says. Existing devices are not competitive and RIM's share in global markets is rapidly eroding. In the lower end of the smartphone market, improved Nokia devices could cut into RIM's share in the international markets, said Credit Suisse, which is keeping a ""neutral"" rating on the stock only because of the potential for a sale of the company. Any talk of a sale also has to take account of the opinion of Canada's federal government, which can block any major takeover of a Canadian company if it decides the deal would not produce a loosely defined ""net benefit"" to the country. ""RIM is a financially and emotionally important company for Canada, so popular resistance to any merger or takeover could occur,"" Strategy Analytics' Mawston said. The market now values RIM at about $7.4 billion, a far cry from the $36 billion valuation it commanded a year ago, but still an expensive risk for any buyer convinced they can do a better job. ""It is clear that the company is in survival mode,"" said Charter Equity analyst Ed Snyder, who has long tracked RIM and watched other once-leading companies such as Nokia, Motorola and Palm flail during turnaround efforts.

201203,UPDATE 2-RIM's first loss in 7 years dims outlook further - analysts,"(Adds background and comments from analysts at Citigroup, RBC) * RBC cuts price target to $13 from $16; BMO to $11 from $12 * Barclays cuts target to $10 from $12; Nomura to $13.25 from $15 * Canaccord Genuity cuts price target to $12 from $15 * Credit Suisse cuts price target to $14.50 from $18 March 30 (Reuters) - Research in Motion faces a tough year ahead as competition heightens for its products, warned analysts as they slashed price targets on the stock, after the company posted a loss and said BlackBerry shipments fell for the holiday quarter. On Thursday, RIM recorded its first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and said it would no longer issue financial forecasts. ""The lack of outlook, unit growth deceleration and inventory build is a negative for RIM's technology supply chain, specifically Celestica Inc, Flextronics International Ltd and Jabil Circuit Inc,"" Citigroup analysts said in a note dated March 29. RIM makes up 20 percent of sales at Celestica, 15 percent at Jabil, and 10 percent at Flextronics, RBC and Citigroup said. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company's BlackBerry shipments dropped 21 percent sequentially, the first decline in the quarter covering Christmas since 2006. Most analysts consider the expected launch of next-generation BlackBerry smartphones later this year as a do-or-die battle for the company, but warn of greater competition. COMPETITION STINGS RIM faces increasing competition across all its products -- from Apple Inc's iPhone 4S and the new iPad, smartphones using Microsoft's Windows software and cheaper smartphones powered by Google Inc's Android, said Canaccord Genuity analysts. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, Barclays Capital, Nomura, BMO, RBC and Credit Suisse slashed their price targets on the U.S.-listed shares of the company. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, nine analysts rate the stock ""hold,"" two have a ""hold,"" and two others rate it a ""buy"" or its equivalent rating. In a ""blossoming smartphone market,"" RIM's volumes over the next one year could actually drop 25 percent, as the existing BB7 devices are not competitive and as RIM's share in the international markets is rapidly eroding, Credit Suisse said. Improvements in the lower end from Nokia could also hurt RIM's share in the international markets, Credit Suisse said, adding that only the potential for a sale of the company keeps their rating on the stock at a ""neutral."" TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE? On Thursday, RIM's new Chief Executive Thorsten Heins announced the initial steps in a strategic overhaul and would not rule out an eventual sale of the company, but a majority of the analysts are skeptical of the company's turnaround efforts. ""Accelerating core business erosion and international pressures narrow RIM's turnaround window... While CEO Heins praises BB10...RIM continues to misread the market and may have lost too much momentum to recover,"" RBC Capital Markets said. Analysts at Nomura, in a note titled ""Too Little, Too Late,"" said RIM was unlikely to succeed as a standalone ecosystem, even if it did find some partners. ""Management still seems keen to succeed at both the high and low ends of the smartphone market, all while still building a standalone application ecosystem,"" Nomura analysts said. Shares of RIM closed at C$13.69 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday. RIM's U.S.-listed shares closed at $13.73.

201203,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Jan. 23: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Jan. 24: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Jan. 25: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. predicts it will start the new year with a surprisingly strong quarter. The outlook helps assure investors that LSI is past the problems caused by the hard disk shortages, which had threatened to have ripple effects on LSI's semiconductors for data storage and networking. Jan. 26: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. Marvell Technology lowers its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, citing Thailand flooding and weak year-end demand among mobile and wireless customers. Emulex Corp., a maker of data storage and network equipment, says it was able to restore full production capacity at a cost of $2.1 million, reducing gross margins during the latest quarter. Feb. 7: Emerson Electric says its net income fell 23 percent as the diversified manufacturing and technology company saw costs rise and sales take a hit from flooding in Thailand. Flooding caused supply chain disruptions that hurt results at Emerson's process management division and to a lesser extent at its network power business, delaying about $300 million in sales, most of which are expected to be recovered this year. Feb. 9: Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's second-biggest maker of PCs, says a global shortage caused by flooding is adding $5 to $10 to the cost of each hard drive. Chief Financial Officer Wong Waiming says the impact of the floods on hard drive production will ""likely continue to affect global PC supply"" into the next quarter and hard drive costs ""will continue to stay high in the short term."" Feb. 22: Hewlett Packard Co. blames flooding for more than half of its drop in revenue, a 7 percent decline to $30 billion. HP says it decided to divert supplies of drives to higher-margin products. It expects constraints to continue in the quarter through April, but the effect on revenue should be smaller compared with the recent quarter. Thursday: Data storage provider Xyratex Ltd. says its net income in the latest quarter more than doubled, despite flooding in Thailand hindering its ability to meet customer needs. Xyratex, based in England, had warned that it may have trouble meeting its customer's storage demands because of a limited supply of certain disk drives. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"Struggling BlackBerry maker to focus on business customers, unable to lure high-end consumers","TORONTO (AP) - Struggling BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Ltd. said Thursday that it plans to return its focus to its corporate customers after failing to compete with flashier, consumer-oriented phones such as Apple's iPhone and models that run Google's Android software. The shift in strategy came with a management shakeup that includes longtime executive Jim Balsillie leaving the board and severing ties with a company he helped build and later see decline. RIM said it will focus its consumer efforts on targeted offerings that tap the company's strengths. That includes devices that employees will want to buy on their own and bring to the corporate environment. The company was exploring partnerships and other opportunities for consumer products that aren't deemed central. Those products could include software and features that are then incorporated into RIM's own offerings. ""We can't do everything ourselves, but we can do what we're good at,"" RIM CEO Thorsten Heins said. RIM has had limited success trying to enter consumer markets in recent years, particularly with high-end devices that sport touch screens popular with consumers. Heins said a turnaround required ""substantial change."" ""We believe that BlackBerry cannot succeed if we tried to be everybody's darling and all things to all people,"" Heins said. ""Therefore, we plan to build on our strength."" Heins, who joined RIM four years ago and was most recently its chief operating officer, replaced co-CEOs Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis in January after the company lost tens of billions in market value. Lazaridis founded the company, and Balsillie had joined in its early years. RIM said Thursday that Balsillie has resigned from its board after 20 years with the company. David Yach, chief technology officer for software, and Jim Rowan, chief operating officer for global operations, also are leaving. The company said it was undergoing a comprehensive strategic review. Heins said he was open to selling the company, but ""it is not the main direction we are pursuing right now."" The Canadian company has long dominated the corporate smartphone market. Its BlackBerrys are known for their security and reliability as email devices. President Barack Obama even refused to part with his BlackBerry after he took office. RIM has sought to expand its appeal to consumers, but it has had trouble because the phones aren't perceived to be as sexy as its chief competitors. RIM has been counting on improvements with its forthcoming BlackBerry 10 system, but that has faced multiple delays. BlackBerrys also lag iPhones or Android phones when it comes to running third-party applications. Touch-screen models that lack physical keyboards have largely flopped. For that reason, BlackBerrys are even losing ground in the business world, as employees demand iPhones or Android devices over BlackBerrys. Apple sold 37 million iPhones in the last three months of 2011 -- more than what RIM shipped in the past three quarters combined. RIM shipped 11.1 million BlackBerrys in the latest quarter, which ended March 3. RIM also bombed in its efforts to produce a tablet computer to compete with Apple's iPad. Among other things, the PlayBook received negative reviews because it launched without an email program and the popular messaging service BlackBerry Messenger. In December, the tablets that originally cost $500 were selling for $200, below the cost of making them. BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis said it's a positive development that RIM is going to focus on its corporate clients and lower-end consumers. ""They are conceding the high-end consumer market with all these services that are wrapped around the platform,"" Gillis said. ""At least there's some reality here. Are they going to compete against iTunes? No way."" Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York, said RIM should have recognized that it is niche player and lost the battle with Apple three years ago. Misek said the company should have looked at partnering with other companies last year rather than now. When he took the CEO job in January, Heins said a drastic change in strategy was not needed. He said Thursday that he changed his mind after conducting his ""own reality check on where the entire company really is."" RIM announced the changes as it announced quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Net loss was $125 million, or 24 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter. This compares with $934 million, or $1.78 per share, a year ago. After excluding one-time items, adjusted income was 80 cents per share, a penny short of expectations from analysts polled by FactSet. Revenue fell 25 percent to $4.2 billion from $5.6 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.5 billion. For the full fiscal year, RIM earned $1.2 billion, or $2.22 a share, on revenue of $18.4 billion. That compares with net income of $3.4 billion, or $6.34 a share, on revenue of $19.9 billion in fiscal 2011. In extended trading after the results came out, RIM shares fell 33 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $13.40. During the regular session, the stock increased 6 cents to close at $13.73. 5 Press Association, Inc.

201203,Nokia to Launch Lumia in China,"BEIJING -- Nokia Corp. is launching sales of its high-end Lumia smartphones in China in a move to gain market share in the world's largest smartphone market and to push forward the troubled company's turnaround. The Finnish phone maker will begin selling its Lumia 800C, which runs with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Phone operating system and is supported by mobile carrier China Telecom Corp., in April for 3,599 yuan, or about $570, roughly within the range for a high-end phone in China. In the second quarter, the company will launch the introductory smartphone Lumia 610C to target younger audiences, said Stephen Elop, chief executive of Nokia, at a press event Wednesday in Beijing. Prices for the 610C haven't yet been set, a Nokia spokeswoman said. The company is also developing phones to work with the other two Chinese networks with which Nokia already has partnerships. ""China is critically important for Nokia,"" said Mr. Elop, adding that the company is designing phones and teaming up with local Internet companies, such as Sina Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., to develop mobile products specifically for the Chinese market. The launch kicks off Nokia's effort to offer a smartphone that more easily taps into existing Web platforms, such as social-networking sites and instant-messenger programs. It comes as Nokia races to gain back market share that other companies, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., earned in the past year with more common smartphone software than Nokia's previous Symbian and MeeGo platforms. China is the world's largest smartphone market by some measures. Research firm Strategy Analytics said deliveries of smartphones to operators and retailers in China totaled 24 million units in the third quarter, compared with 23 million units in the U.S. It said Nokia had the largest smartphone share with 28%, but that Apple and Samsung are closing in fast. Analysts said offering cheaper Windows phones is key for Nokia's position in China and in its effort to turn around its business. The company also faces stiff competition with Chinese phone makers such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., which offer lower-end handsets with Google Inc.'s Android operating system for less than $200. The company plans to offer a wide variety of smartphones at various prices to satisfy all consumers, said Colin Giles, executive vice president of Nokia's global sales division. Analysts caution that Nokia will face a tough time posting strong growth. ""Nokia has already missed out on major growth, indicating that the road ahead will be challenging,"" said Andrew Milroy, head of research at market-research firm Frost & Sullivan in Singapore. Mr. Giles said the industry is still in its infancy in China.

201203,Can CEO Revive BlackBerry?,"TORONTO -- Research In Motion Ltd.'s chief executive, Thorsten Heins, vowed to improve execution and marketing at the struggling maker of BlackBerry smartphones when he took the job two months ago. Investors should get the first clue Thursday as to whether he'll be able to fulfill those promises as RIM reports quarterly results. Some are hoping for a better sense of how the former Siemens AG executive plans to turn around the Waterloo, Ontario, company. Analysts forecast RIM's earnings fell more than 50% to 81 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter as revenue declined 19% to about $4.53 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Since taking over, Mr. Heins has pushed to streamline RIM operations and has considered paring the number of BlackBerry models the company turns out, people familiar with the situation say. But he also has failed to appoint a new chief marketing officer, one of his early pledges as CEO. ""People want to hear if [Mr. Heins] has a plan,"" says Ehud Gelblum, a managing director of research at Morgan Stanley. ""People would love to hear if there are any new ideas, because it is hard to figure out how they turn this around."" So far, investors haven't been impressed. RIM shares, after falling more than 75% and wiping away some $30 billion in market value through last year, have fallen another 8% since Mr. Heins's appointment on Jan. 24. Mr. Heins was unavailable to comment but a spokeswoman said he ""has been meeting with customers, suppliers, analysts, partners, employees,"" and ""will be providing a business update when the company reports Q4 results on Thursday."" The company canceled a May meeting with analysts, pushing it to after the introduction of the BlackBerry 10. RIM continues to struggle with severe smartphone market-share erosion, amid competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhone and devices running Google Inc.'s Android operating system. RIM also is still mired in a costly and so far unsuccessful effort to break into the tablet market with its PlayBook. Applications developers have continued to shun both the BlackBerry and the PlayBook. A survey conducted by market-research firm IDC and Appcelerator, released last week, showed that only 16% of developers were ""very interested"" in creating apps for the BlackBerry or PlayBook, compared with 79% that were ""very interested"" in creating iPhone and iPad apps. Thursday's earnings and conference call with analysts will offer Mr. Heins an opportunity to emerge from the shadows of RIM's two, longtime co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. He took the reins after the two stepped down from their executive roles following months of pressure from shareholders. Messrs. Balsillie and Lazaridis remain directors and big RIM shareholders. Mr. Heins, a former RIM chief operating officer, has signaled that he won't engage infundamental strategic shifts at RIM. His plan hinges on a successful rollout this year of RIM's next-generation smartphone, the BlackBerry 10. Meantime, RIM has ramped-up marketing for its current line, the BlackBerry 7. But many analysts say they don't expect those efforts to have meaningfully increased sales of the phone in the latest quarter. Mr. Heins spent his initial weeks as CEO on the road, attempting to reassure carriers in the U.S., U.K. and Europe that RIM still was a viable company and that its next line of phones would be a hit, according to people close to the company. Then he returned to RIM headquarters with the aim of streamlining operations. Part of that effort is considering a reduction in the number of BlackBerry models, according to these people. The company has been criticized for making too many BlackBerry models, which could confuse consumers. The BlackBerry 7 line, for instance, comes in eight different variations. Most analysts think RIM will come in below its forecast for revenue -- between $4.6 billion and $4.9 billion in the quarter -- and that sales of older generation smartphones and the newer BlackBerry 7 devices will appear weak. Some analysts said they expect sales in recent RIM regional strongholds such as Latin America might be weaker than in the past. There have been some signs of progress under Mr. Heins. RIM last month released an updated operating system for its PlayBook tablet that corrected the device's biggest failing -- which prevented users from accessing access email directly on the device. Last week, RIM said it would offer apps developers a prototype of its next line of smartphones at a BlackBerry conference in May -- a device that will allow them for the first time to test drive the BlackBerry 10 operating system. RIM has yet to set a launch date for the phones, though analysts don't expect to see them until late in the year. People close to the company say Mr. Heins has succeeded in instilling new focus at the company. Employees are ""all marching in the same direction now,"" toward developing the BlackBerry 10 smartphones, according to a person close to the company. ""Everyone has their heads down working -- just, 'Get the job done' stuff,"" this person said. ""Which is quite a bit different from last summer when people didn't know whether they'd have jobs.""

201203,Nokia Pins Smartphone Hopes on China,"BERLIN — Nokia said Wednesday that it would begin selling its new line of Lumia phones in China next month through one of the country’s largest mobile operators as it looks to speed its recovery in the lucrative market for smartphones. China Telecom, with 126 million customers, will begin selling the Nokia Lumia 800C, a third-generation smartphone using the Windows operating system, in April. The operator will also begin selling the Lumia 610, Nokia’s least expensive Windows smartphone, by June. A Chinese mobile analyst said the product introductions were likely to lift Nokia’s chances of building momentum for Lumia Windows phones in China and in other countries. Under its year-old collaboration with Microsoft, Nokia is phasing out smartphones using its own Symbian operating system in favor of Windows. “Nokia’s Windows phones will greatly help the company improve its market performance in China,” said Kevin Wang, an analyst at the research firm IHS Global Products and Services in Shanghai. The Chinese smartphone market is booming, and Nokia has timed the introduction of the Lumia 800C to exploit the anticipated surge in growth. Sales of smartphones in China are expected to rise to 120 million this year from 65 million in 2011, according to IHS. The Lumia 800C and 610 will run on China Telecom’s wireless network, which uses a local variant of the code division multiple access, or CDMA, international technology standard. After initial introductions in some European and Asian markets last year, Nokia is planning to bring Lumia phones to the United States and Latin America this year. Sales of CDMA phones in China are expected to reach 60 million units this year from 30 million in 2011. Last year, Nokia had 1 percent of China’s CDMA market, Mr. Wang said. But that share is likely to grow, he said, through the cooperation with China Telecom. Nokia, the maker of mobile phones, has been a longtime employer and supplier of phones in China. In 2011, China accounted for 17 percent of Nokia’s global sales. The company, based in Espoo, Finland, sold 65.8 million cellphones, mostly not its smartphones, last year in China, which generated sales of $6.7 billion. Nokia employed 22,568 people in China in 2011. The Nokia chief executive, Stephen A. Elop, said Nokia planned to sell its full line of Lumia smartphones, which includes the Lumia 710, 800 and 900, in China by the end of June. Those sales could take place through China Telecom or with other operators, Mr. Elop said. Mr. Elop and Wang Xiaochu, the chairman of China Telecom, announced the introduction at a news conference in Beijing. Mr. Elop, a former Microsoft senior executive, said China Telecom and Nokia had worked closely to integrate China Telecom services on the devices. The Lumia 800C, which is expected to cost 3,599 renminbi ($571) without the operator’s subsidy, will have music, games, video and reading applications on its home screen.

201203,Another Good Day for I.P.O.'s as Millennial Media Nearly Doubles,"The market for initial public stock offerings is riding high as another company has soared in its first day of trading. On Thursday, shares of Millennial Media, a mobile advertising company, closed at $25, nearly double its initial offering price of $13. Millennial's results came a day after the strong debut of Annie's, the organic food maker, whose shares rose 64 percent on Wednesday, their first day of trading. Shares in Annie's, based in Berkeley, Calif., rose an additional 5.6 percent on Thursday, to $37.92. Since the beginning of the year, about 85 percent of all offerings in the United States have risen above their initial offering price, according to Renaissance Capital, a research firm. A quarter have increased more than 50 percent from that initial level. The recent results suggest that the market for newly public companies is returning to life after a period of weakness. Investors, eagerly awaiting the debut of the social network Facebook, are pouring their money into smaller offerings in the meantime. ""There's hardly been a deal that has not worked since February,"" said Scott Sweet, a managing partner of IPOboutique.com. ""The I.P.O. market is more frothy now."" Technology is among the most attractive areas. Millenial's market debut was the strongest for a tech company since LinkedIn went public in May. Its stock performance on Thursday showed investors' desire to tap into the growing use of smartphones like iPhones and Android devices. Investors also do not seem deterred by potential red flags. Rexnord, which went public on Thursday, is using proceeds from its stock sale to pay down as much as $300 million in debt. Investors have sometimes shied away from such offerings, wary of buying into a company with a hefty debt load that needs to be paid down. But Rexnord and Allison Transmission, a vehicle parts maker owned by the Carlyle Group and Onex, which went public on March 15, have remained above their offering prices. Still, the strong performances of companies this week is only starting to make up for the initial public offering drought. Over the last year, the number of global initial offerings is down more than half, to 45, according to Renaissance data. Investors are still being discerning. Shares in CafePress, an e-commerce specialist that personalizes merchandise like T-shirts, closed at $19.03 on Thursday, only three cents above its initial offering price. Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, which specializes in cancer treatments, tumbled 13.7 percent in its debut on Thursday, closing at $6.04. * Rexnord Opens Above I.P.O.

201203,"A Bet on Mobile, Millennial Media Soars on Debut","Millennial Media, a mobile advertising network, surged in its debut on Thursday, as investors placed a big bet on the future of mobile communications. Shares of Millennial nearly doubled at the opening and climbed as high as $27.90 in morning trading, before pulling back slightly. The Baltimore-based company, which priced its shares at $13 on Wednesday night, raised $132.6 million in its offering. At $25 a share, the company is valued at $1.87 billion. It is the strongest debut for a technology company since LinkedIn went public in May, more than doubling on its first day of trading. Millennial's bankers raised the offering's expected range to $11 to $13 a share, before setting the price at the high end. The exuberance for Millennial Media underscores the rising profile of mobile technology companies, particularly those that help serve advertising to consumers. Millennial, a large independent mobile advertising network, recorded revenue of $103.7 million last year -- more than double the previous year. The company works with application developers to help them target and serve ads on mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets. According a recent filing, the company's advertising network reached more than 300 million unique users in February, with almost half coming from the United States. It served about 45 billion ad impressions that month. It has a 16.7 percent share of the mobile advertising market in the United States, according to the International Data Corporation. Millennial said it planned to use the proceeds from the sale for international expansion, possible acquisitions, product development and other general expenses. Existing shareholders are selling one million shares in the offering. While none of Millennial's large venture capital backers are selling shares in the offering, several members of its management team are participating, including Paul Palmieri, its chief executive, Chris Brandenburg, the chief technology officer, Stephen Root, the chief operating officer, and Michael Avon, the chief financial officer. Mr. Palmieri is selling the largest block, accounting for 394,544 shares in the offering. Millennial's underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays, have an option to sell an additional 1.5 million shares.

201203,Nokia to Sell Lumia Smartphone in China,"BEIJING -- Nokia Corp. is launching sales of its high-end Lumia smartphones in China in a move to gain market share in the world's largest smartphone market and to push forward the company's turnaround. The Finnish phone maker will begin selling its Lumia 800C, which runs with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Phone operating system and is supported by mobile carrier China Telecom Corp., in April for 3,599 yuan, or about $570, roughly within the range for a high-end phone in China. In the second quarter, the company will launch the introductory smartphone Lumia 610C to target younger audiences, said Stephen Elop, chief executive of Nokia, at a press event Wednesday in Beijing. Prices for the 610C haven't yet been set, a Nokia spokeswoman said. The company is also developing phones to work with the other two Chinese networks with which Nokia already has partnerships. ""China is critically important for Nokia,"" said Mr. Elop, adding that the company is designing phones and teaming up with local Internet companies, such as Sina Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., to develop mobile products specifically for the Chinese market. The launch kicks off Nokia's effort to offer a smartphone that more easily taps into existing Web platforms, such as social-networking sites and instant-messenger programs. It comes as Nokia races to gain back market share that other companies, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., earned in the past year with more common smartphone software than Nokia's previous Symbian and MeeGo platforms. China is the world's largest smartphone market by some measures. Research firm Strategy Analytics said deliveries of smartphones to operators and retailers in China totaled 24 million units in the third quarter, compared with 23 million units in the U.S. It said Nokia had the largest smartphone share with 28%, but that Apple and Samsung are closing in fast. Analysts said offering cheaper Windows phones is key for Nokia's position in China and in its effort to turn around its business. The company also faces stiff competition with Chinese phone makers such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., which offer lower-end handsets with Google Inc.'s Android operating system for less than $200. The company plans to offer a wide variety of smartphones at various prices to satisfy all consumers, said Colin Giles, executive vice president of Nokia's global sales division. Analysts caution that Nokia will face a tough time posting strong growth. ""Nokia has already missed out on major growth, indicating that the road ahead will be challenging,"" said Andrew Milroy, head of research at market-research firm Frost & Sullivan in Singapore. Mr. Giles said the industry is still in its infancy in China. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,"New RIM Chief Will Step Into Spotlight --- After Just Two Months as CEO, Thorsten Heins to Deliver Progress Report on Turnaround at BlackBerry Maker","TORONTO -- Research In Motion Ltd.'s chief executive, Thorsten Heins, vowed to improve execution and marketing at the struggling maker of BlackBerry smartphones when he took the job two months ago. On Thursday, investors should get the first clue as to whether he'll be able to fulfill those promises as RIM reports fiscal fourth-quarter results. Some are hoping for a better sense of how the former Siemens AG executive plans to turn around the Waterloo, Ontario, company. Analysts are expecting a quarterly profit of 81 cents a share on $4.53 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc., down from reported earnings of $1.78 a share on sales of $5.6 billion a year ago. Since taking over, Mr. Heins has pushed to streamline RIM operations and has considered paring the number of BlackBerry models the company turns out, say people familiar with the situation. But he has also failed thus far to appoint a new chief marketing officer, one of his early pledges as CEO. ""People want to hear if [Mr. Heins] has a plan,"" says Ehud Gelblum, a managing director of research at Morgan Stanley. ""People would love to hear if there are any new ideas, because it is hard to figure out how they turn this around."" So far, investors haven't been impressed. RIM shares, after falling more than 75% and wiping away some $30 billion in market value through 2011, have fallen another 8% since Mr. Heins's appointment on Jan. 24. Mr. Heins was unavailable to comment but a spokeswoman said he ""has been meeting with customers, suppliers, analysts, partners, employees,"" and ""will be providing a business update when the company reports Q4 results on Thursday."" The company canceled a May meeting with analysts, pushing it to after the launch of BlackBerry 10. RIM continues to struggle with steep smartphone market-share erosion, amid competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhone and devices running Google Inc.'s Android operating system. RIM is also still mired in a costly and so far unsuccessful effort to break into the tablet market with its poor-selling PlayBook. Applications developers, meanwhile, have continued to shun both the BlackBerry and the PlayBook. A survey by market-research firm IDC and Appcelerator, released last week, showed that only 16% of developers were ""very interested"" in creating apps for the BlackBerry or PlayBook, compared with 79% that were ""very interested"" in creating iPhone and iPad apps. Thursday's earnings and conference call with analysts will offer Mr. Heins an opportunity to emerge from the shadows of RIM's two, longtime co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. He took the reins after the two stepped down from their executive roles following months of pressure from shareholders. Messrs. Balsillie and Lazaridis remain big RIM shareholders and RIM directors. Mr. Heins, RIM's former chief operating officer and a former Siemens executive, has signaled he won't engage in fundamental strategic shifts at RIM. His plan hinges on a successful rollout of RIM's next-generation smartphone, dubbed BlackBerry 10, and due this year. Meantime, RIM has ramped-up marketing for its current line of smartphones, called BlackBerry 7. But many analysts say they don't expect those efforts to have meaningfully increased sales of the phone in the latest quarter. Mr. Heins spent his initial weeks as CEO on the road, attempting to reassure carriers in the U.S., U.K. and Europe that RIM was still a viable company worth doing business with, and that its next line of phones would be a hit, according to people close to the company. Then he returned to RIM headquarters with the aim of streamlining operations. Part of that effort is considering reducing the number of BlackBerry models the company makes, according to these people. The company has been criticized in the past for making too many BlackBerry models, which could confuse consumers. The BlackBerry 7 line, for instance, comes in eight different models. Most analysts think RIM will come in below its guidance for revenue -- between $4.6 billion and $4.9 billion in the quarter -- and that sales of both older generation smartphones and the newer BlackBerry 7 devices will remain weak. Some analysts think that even sales in recent RIM regional strongholds such as Latin America may be weaker than in the past. There have been some signs of progress under Mr. Heins. RIM last month released an updated operating system for its PlayBook tablet that corrected the device's biggest failing by allowing users to access email without being tethered to a BlackBerry. Last week, RIM said it would offer apps developers a prototype of its next line of smartphones at a BlackBerry conference in May -- a device that will allow them to test drive the BlackBerry 10 operating system. RIM has yet to set a launch date for the phone itself, though analysts don't expect to see it until late in the year. People close to the company say Mr. Heins has succeeded in instilling new focus at the company. Employees are ""all marching in the same direction now,"" toward developing the BlackBerry 10 smartphones, according to one person close to the company.

201203,"Best Buy Forced to Rethink Big Box; As Shopper Habits Change in a Mobile World, Electronics Retailer Pares Stores, Tests Smaller Formats","Best Buy Co., which once out-muscled rivals with stores as big as 58,000 square feet, is moving away from the ""big box"" business model that it long used to crush competitors in consumer-electronics retailing. The electronics giant—now itself being out-manuevered by Internet rivals with lower operating costs—plans several new tactics to improve weak sales. On Thursday it said it will close 50 big-box stores this year, and test remodeled store formats in San Antonio and Minneapolis. It will also lay off 400 workers as part of a plan to trim $800 million in costs and restructure its ailing business. Coming next: Hundreds of small stores that will focus on selling mobile phones. Consumers armed with smartphones are changing the fundamental relationship between shopper and retailer. The new ease of mobile shopping and price comparison is accelerating the trend of ""showrooming""—where shoppers come in to stores to see an item but buy it elsewhere. It is a particular problem for Best Buy because electronics are expensive enough to make price comparisons worthwhile, and because electronics are easy to order online. The trend greatly benefits Amazon.com Inc. and other Internet retailers, which aren't required to collect sales taxes in most states and aren't encumbered by the costs of running physical locations. Best Buy also has been outshone by Apple Inc.'s fast-growing gadget stores, which deliver some of the highest sales in retailing. The company says it is not headed to the retail graveyard that swallowed one-time rival Circuit City Stores Inc., in 2009. But it acknowledged that earlier efforts to tweak its strategy, rather than overhaul it, haven't succeeded. ""I am not satisfied with the pace or degree of change we have made up to this point,"" Chief Executive Brian Dunn said in a conference call with analysts, adding, ""We are evolving our retail store strategy. We are increasing our points of presence while decreasing our overall square footage."" Best Buy shares have lost more than half of their value in the past five years, and dropped another 7% Thursday to $24.77 on the New York Stock Exchange. The changes were announced along with dreary quarterly results. Best Buy had a loss of $1.7 billion, or $4.89 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $651 million, or $1.62 a share. It included $2.6 billion in restructuring costs and other charges previously announced as it exited its big-box store business in the U.K. Stripping out those one-time costs, per-share profit of $2.47 exceeded the $2.16 expected by analysts. In an interview Thursday, Mr. Dunn said that he remains confident that Best Buy can compete against online retailing rivals. ""While we know 'showrooming' happens, we continue to be the No. 1 player in consumer electronics,"" said Mr. Dunn, a one-time store manager. ""Really, if a customer comes into our store to see something, I like our odds."" If they come in. Apple's namesake stores have eroded the status of specialty chains as the one-stop shops for the latest in gadgetry. Apple stores notched $6.1 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in December, a 59% increase over the previous year. (Apple's total revenue for the quarter jumped 73% to $46.3 billion.) Best Buy's revenue in the latest quarter rose 3.4% to $16.63 billion. But Best Buy's sales at stores, websites and call centers open at least 14 months fell 2.4% compared with the year before. The decline, largely due to drops in TV and laptop sales, came despite a 21% gain in online sales. Best Buy itself sells Apple devices, and a lot of them. A recent survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found that 13% of U.S. iPhone buyers over a three-month period bought the phones at Best Buy, while 15% got them at Apple's stores. But competition from Apple and the stores of phone carriers has left Best Buy with a smaller share in the new hot electronics category than it has traditionally had in former best-sellers such as flat-screen televisions and DVD players. In a strategy that mimics the Apple stores' ""Genius Bars,"" Best Buy is testing what it calls ""connected store"" formats in the Twin Cities and San Antonio in time for the Christmas buying season. The stores, which will emphasize services such as tech support and wireless connections, will feature large hubs at their center to assist shoppers, as well as reconfigured checkout lanes and new areas to speed the pickup of items bought online. The company said it has tested individual remodels in Las Vegas and elsewhere with positive results. Best Buy also said it planned to more aggressively court frequent customers by boosting its loyalty program to include free expedited shipping and a 60-day price-match guarantee. Addressing complaints about customer service, Best Buy said it would substantially increase worker training and offer staffers financial incentives, a strategy that has already boosted mobile phone sales. But the company will reward teams of employees and isn't returning to the individual sales commissions that Best Buy nearly made extinct in consumer electronics with its no-commission sales force. Many analysts said the move to rethink the purpose of Best Buy stores was long overdue, noting that closing 50 out of 1,100 big stores amounts to a reduction of just 4.5%. Many had labeled as inadequate Best Buy's previous pledge to shrink its square footage by 10%. ""This is what needs to be happening,"" said David Strasser of Janney Montgomery Scott, who believes that Best Buy remains positioned to prosper in the long term with a smaller-store presence. The accelerated move to smaller stores is a major departure from the old winning formula for Best Buy, which swept across America in the 1990s and 2000s with megastores that used wide selections of discounted movies and music discs to lure in customers for higher-priced items. Best Buy's dominant position appeared secured during the recession when archrival Circuit City declared bankruptcy and liquidated, but declining movie and CD sales caught up with the company. It cut back on the merchandise, leaving huge spaces in its cavernous stores, most of which are 30,000 to 45,000 square feet. The company projected earnings of between $3.50 to $3.80 a share for its new fiscal year, and generally flat revenue of $50 billion to $51 billion.

201203,UPDATE 4-RIM posts loss as new CEO begins to clean house,"* New CEO says RIM is reviewing ""strategic options"" * RIM post first quarterly GAAP loss since 2005 * RIM shares down 2.4 pct after dropping as much 9 pct * Investors may be encouraged by new CEO's plan, analysts say * Former co-CEO Balsillie resigns as director (Edits throughout) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, March 29 (Reuters) - Research In Motion posted a net loss and its first slump in BlackBerry shipments for its holiday quarter since 2006, as its new CEO announced the initial steps in a strategic overhaul and would not rule out an eventual sale of the company. RIM's shares dropped as much as 9 percent on Thursday after the company said it would no longer issue financial forecasts and was reviewing ""strategic opportunities"" such as partnerships and joint-venture licensing, and other ways to leverage its assets. A handful of senior executives, including former co-CEO and current director Jim Balsillie, will depart. Chief Executive Thorsten Heins, who took over from Balsillie and co-CEO Mike Lazaridis in January, said he was still focusing on a turnaround of the company, which has been hammered by competition from Apple and Google's Android in recent years. Even so, if the review pointed in the direction of a possible sale, he said, ""We would consider it, but it is not the main direction we are pursuing right now."" ""I did my own reality check on where the entire company really is,"" he said during a conference call with analysts. ""It is now very clear to me that substantial change is what RIM needs."" After Heins spoke, RIM's shares settled about 2.4 percent lower, in part because he left open the option of partnerships that analysts said could allow the company to exit some aspects of its business, such as making hardware, while focusing on software and services. ""If you look at this quarter alone ... things are certainly incrementally worse. But on the flip side, he's raised some possibilities of strategy change, which a lot of people think is called for,"" Avian Securities analyst Matthew Thornton said. Investors may also have been encouraged by signs that Heins was putting his stamp on the company. RIM said Balsillie, who long served as RIM's public face, was stepping down as a board director a few weeks after he gave up his role as co-CEO. Dan Dodge, former head of QNX Software, will replace David Yach as RIM's top software architect. RIM bought QNX in 2010 and is counting on the operating system to power its PlayBook tablet and redesigned BlackBerry 10 smartphones that will be launched later this year. In addition, Jim Rowan also left as chief operating officer and RIM is looking for his replacement. It is still searching for a chief marketing officer to lead its promotional efforts. BLACKBERRY SHIPMENTS SLUMP The Waterloo, Ontario-based company shipped 11.1 million BlackBerry smartphones in the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 3, down 21 percent from the third quarter, but slightly ahead of analysts' pes simistic ex pectations. I t was the first decline in the quarter covering Christmas since 2006 and only the second time RIM has reported the metric dropping for that crucial period. RIM sold more than 500,000 PlayBooks in the fourth quarter, a number inflated by deep discounts offered to boost sales of the product. The decline in BlackBerry shipments suggests that RIM, at best, is treading water until it releases its next-generation of BlackBerry smartphones. Most analysts consider that a do-or-die launch for the company as it falls further behind Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad and devices powered by Google's Android. ""PAYING THE PRICE"" The company is now paying the price for failing to heed calls to move quickly to license its operating system and consider other strategies to compete with industry titan Apple, said Peter Misek, managing director of Jefferies & Co. ""It's going to be absolute gong show for the next few quarters,"" he said. ""They're going to scramble around now for the next three to six months, and every poor shareholder that had faith in them is going to be potentially impoverished. I'm so angry as a Canadian - every Canadian investor should be angry."" While analysts generally approved of the more candid tone by Heins compared with that of his predecessors, most questioned if the new CEO would have enough time to pull off his plans. ""RIM has to orchestrate this turnaround within a shrinking window of opportunity. The market will determine how long that window stays open,"" said CCS Insight analyst John Jackson. ""Ultimately, RIM is taking half measures, baby-stepping their way to a reorganization and they're not moving fast enough,"" said Ed Snyder, an analyst with Charter Equity Research. ""They need a wholesale change in the culture and the management of the company."" GUIDANCE WITHHELD RIM said its decision to no longer provide specific financial guidance reflected an inability to forecast accurately given the weakness of its U.S. business and competitive pressure in global markets as it increasingly relies on sales of more low-end devices. RIM, which has historically provided a forecast for BlackBerry shipments, earnings per share and revenue, has faced scathing criticism in the past year for missing its targets. Last year it stopped reporting average selling prices and subscriber additions. For its fourth quarter, RIM reported a net loss of $125 million, or 24 cents a share, after booking writedowns on its legacy BlackBerry 7 phones and goodwill. RIM last recorded a loss under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, when it booked tax expenses and paid to resolve a patent infringement case that had threatened to shut down its U.S. operations. On an adjusted basis excluding the writedowns , profit in the latest quarter more than halved to $418 million, or 80 cents a share, from $934 million, or $1.78, a year earlier. Revenue slumped to $4.19 billion from $5.56 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected RIM to earn 81 cents a share on revenue of $4.54 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding several major writedowns, RIM had adjusted earnings of $4.20 per share in the full fiscal year, after forecasting a year ago it would earn more than $7.50 a share. That target was cut several times before RIM abandoned it altogether after a spate of product delays, a global service outage and disappointing shipment numbers. ""They clearly have no fix on when this process will bottom, and until it really does, it's going to be very difficult for a lot of investors to come back in,"" said Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager at Ironfire Capital in New York. Shares of RIM were trading down 2.4 percent at $13.40 after the bell. Soon after the company released its results, the stock fell as much as 9 percent. The shares have fallen 80 percent since February 2011.

201203,"UPDATE 4-Best Buy sales, restructuring disappoint","* Q4 sales miss expectations * To close 50 U.S. big-box stores this fiscal year * Sees cost savings of $800 million by fiscal 2015 * Sees FY 2013 EPS ex-items of $3.50 to $3.80 * Shares down 7 percent (Adds jobs, real estate, shares) By Dhanya Skariachan March 29 (Reuters) - Best Buy Co reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and said it would close 50 large U.S. stores and lay off another 400 employees, disappointing investors looking for even deeper cuts to turn around the world's largest consumer electronics chain. The news drove Best Buy shares down as much as 10 percent to touch an intraday low of $23.97, shaving $920 million off its market capitalization to $8.4 billion. The shares were down just over 7 percent at $24.71 in afternoon trading. Analysts said the company needs to close more than 50 of its 1,100 big box stores to cut costs at a time when shoppers are increasingly buying electronics online. The retailer, which employs 180,000 people, said it would cut 400 corporate and support jobs, but did not say how many jobs would be lost as a result of the store closures. ""These are steps in the right direction,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba said. ""Beyond the weak (sales), I think what the market is telling you is that they don't think they went far enough from a restructuring perspective."" Best Buy should try to relocate more stores to smaller locations, sub-lease portions of their bigger stores and shutter more unprofitable stores, he said. A Best Buy spokeswoman said it has yet to finalize the locations and timing of the store closings. The company expects the restructuring efforts to cut costs by $800 million in the next three years, including $250 million this year. Overall, landlords with the biggest exposure to big-box stores are Canadian company Callowy Real Estate Investment Trust , National Retail Properties Inc and Retail Properties of America Inc, which is set to go public and was formerly known as Inland Western. ""But nearly everyone has some exposure to Best Buy at this point,"" said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Benjamin Yang. THE REAL ESTATE IMPACT Best Buy's decision to close big-box stores was not surprising to the real estate investment community, Yang said. But the sector, particularly real estate companies that focus on big-box shopping centers, has been wrestling with filling empty stores or soon-empty stores left by the bankruptcies of Circuit City, Mervyns and more recently Sears Holdings Corp's decision to close or sell off stores. Some landlords have filled spaces left by closings. While others, such as General Growth Properties Inc's plan to raze the big boxes and replace them with smaller, specialty stores. ""It's hard to say today who the natural replacement would be for that space,"" Yang said. ""I think right now there are none. But longer term, down the road, it's hard to say who might take those big-box spaces or even if big-box space will be a thing of the past."" AMAZON BEATING BEST BUY? Despite offering bigger discounts and free shipping to lure shoppers from its rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc, Best Buy's same-store sales fell 2.4 percent in the quarter, including a 2.2 percent decline at its U.S. stores open at least 14 months. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter was looking for a 1.8 percent same-store sales decline in the quarter, including a 1.4 percent decline at its domestic stores. Its sales rose to $16.63 billion, but fell far short of the analysts' average estimate of $17.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Unlike the 2010 holiday season, when Best Buy held the line on discounts and promoted only expensive goods, this time it offered deep discounts on everything from flat-screen TVs to digital cameras. It also promised to match any lower prices that its brick-and-mortar competitors advertised during the season's peak and offered free online shipping. Still, industry watchers contend that Best Buy stores increasingly serve as physical showrooms for online retailers. Amazon enjoys its largest pricing advantage versus brick-and-mortar rivals in the consumer electronics segment, with prices 17 percent lower on average, Chukumba has estimated. ""We remain concerned about the sustainability of Best Buy's big-box model. The company is gradually becoming a physical showroom for online retailers and the prevalence of smartphones makes comparison shopping increasingly easy,"" Pachter said. Best Buy lost $1.7 billion, or $4.89 a share, in the fourth quarter that ended March 3, compared with net income of $651 million, or $1.62 a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges, it earned $2.47 a share. Analysts were looking for a profit of $2.16 a share on that basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. THE SMALLER THE BETTER Best Buy is now trying to focus on its smaller format stores. It will close 50 U.S. big-box stores and open 100 Best Buy small-format, stand-alone stores in the current fiscal 2013. The changes should help lower the retailer's overall cost structure, Chief Executive Brian Dunn said in a statement. Best Buy plans to invest some of the savings into improving customer service, including expanding its Reward Zone Silver loyalty program, and giving store employees more training before the next holiday season. It will also offer competitive prices as part of its push to drive revenue, and over time, some of the savings should fall to the bottom line, Dunn said.

201203,Best Buy to cut $800M in costs by fiscal 2015; adj. 4th-quarter profit tops Street's view,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - In order to grow, Best Buy is shrinking. The largest U.S. specialty electronics retailer for years expanded quickly by opening big-box stores across the country. But shoppers have started using the hulking stores as showrooms where they can test out products before buying them cheaper elsewhere. To revamp the struggling chain, Best Buy said Thursday it plans to close 50 of its U.S. big box stores, cut 400 corporate jobs and trim $800 million in costs. The company, which has about 1,400 U.S. locations, also plans to open 100 smaller and more profitable Best Buy Mobile stores throughout the country. ""How do we position the company so we're where our customers need us to be?"" asked CEO Brian Dunn in a call on Thursday with analysts. ""We're clearly going to have more doors and less square footage."" Best Buy is trying to avoid the fate of its rival Circuit City, which liquidated in 2009 after it struggled with the changing electronics landscape. Sales of TVs, digital cameras and videogame consoles -- once the bread-and-butter of electronics retailers -- have weakened, while sales of lower-margin items like tablet computers, smartphones and e-readers have increased. The rise in competition from Internet rivals like Amazon.com and discounters like Target also has hurt electronics retailers. To better compete, Best Buy is shaking up its business. In addition to closing some of its big box stores, the company said it will focus on what sets it apart from its rivals: Trained sales staff that can help shoppers get the most out of their tablets, TVs and other electronic devices, including tech support from its ""Geek Squad"" service and repair unit. But even as the Best Buy announced its changes on Thursday, the Minneapolis-based company also posted a $1.7 billion fiscal fourth quarter loss that's partly due to restructuring charges. Despite the loss, Best Buy's adjusted results for the quarter topped Wall Street's expectations. But as investors worried that Best Buy's restructuring didn't go far enough, its shares slid nearly 7 percent to close at $24.77 Thursday. Best Buy's loss amounted to $4.89 per share for the period ended March 3, compared with a profit of $651 million, or $1.62 per share, a year ago. Results included $2.6 billion in charges mostly related to its purchase of Carphone Warehouse Group PLC's interest in the Best Buy Mobile profit-sharing agreement and related costs, as well as an impairment charge tied to writing off Best Buy Europe goodwill and restructuring charges. Taking these items out, adjusted earnings were $2.47 per share, above the $2.15 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast. Revenue rose 3 percent to $16.08 billion, but missed Wall Street's $17.18 billion estimate. Revenue at stores open at least a year -- an indicator of a retailer's health -- slipped 2.4 percent. But it was a smaller drop than a year earlier when the company reported a 4.7 percent decline. For the full year, Best Buy lost $1.23 billion, or $3.36 per share, compared with a profit of $1.28 billion, or $3.08 per share, in the prior year. Adjusted earnings were $3.64 per share, which tops the previous year's $3.43 per share. Annual revenue rose 2 percent to $50.71 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year fell 1.7 percent. In the prior-year period, the figure dropped 1.8 percent. Looking forward, Best Buy forecasts fiscal 2013 earnings of $2.85 to $3.25 per share and adjusted earnings of $3.50 to $3.80 per share. Analysts expect earnings of $3.67 per share. It expects fiscal 2013 revenue of $50 billion to $51 billion. That estimate falls slightly short of analyst predictions of $51.6 billion. Meanwhile, Best Buy expects revenue at stores open at least one year to fall 2 percent to 4 percent. ""The firm is taking incremental steps to address its strategic challenges,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler. ""That said, the soft close to the quarter, and subdued sales guidance, suggest that competitive pressure may be drifting into market share as well as margin."" 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"Buying Stake in Sharp, Foxconn of Taiwan Gets a Foothold in Japan","TOKYO -- In another sign of China's manufacturing ascent as Japan struggles, the Taiwanese giant Foxconn Technology will become the largest shareholder in Sharp, a former exemplar of Japan's electronics empire that has fallen on hard times. Besides giving Sharp an injection of cash, the Foxconn deal, announced here Tuesday, will aim to help the Japanese company restore profitability to its TV manufacturing and liquid-crystal display businesses. Sharp is a big maker of flat-panel television sets, and is still considered an innovator in liquid-crystal display, or LCD, technology. But the company is hemorrhaging money. And, like its compatriots Sony and Panasonic, Sharp has lost ground to more nimble South Korean companies like Samsung and LG. Headquartered in Taiwan, Foxconn has become a world leader on the strength of its sprawling factory campuses on the Chinese mainland. It is primarily a contract manufacturer, with premier clients that include Apple for which it makes iPads and iPhones. Foxconn, whose formal name is the Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, has repeatedly come under scrutiny for the labor practices that enable it to crank out products at high volume and low cost. In response to reports of suicides at Foxconn's plants and accusations that it forces employees to work grueling shifts under sometimes dangerous conditions, Apple has hired a nonprofit group, the Fair Labor Association, to investigate. The association, which is examining Apple's various suppliers, is expected to release its report soon. China, which long served Japanese industry primarily as a low-cost operating base for manufacturing, is now bringing its money and methods to Japan. Last year, a Chinese company bought the washing machine and refrigerator manufacturing business of Sanyo Electric. Chinese manufacturers have recently agreed to build a plastics plant and a heavy machinery factory in western Japan. And in 2011, for the first time, the number of mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in Japan exceeded those by American businesses. Even if Sharp does not fully adopt Foxconn's methods after the investment, the Japanese company's manufacturing model could benefit from streamlining. Japanese manufacturers have long clung to a vertically integrated approach in which they try to make most of their products in-house. It is a business model that served companies like Sharp well in the 1980s and 1990s, but more recently has been overtaken by electronics companies that outsource most of their manufacturing. Especially in high-cost Japan, vertical integration is strangling profitability, Sharp's incoming president, Takashi Okuda, said Tuesday. ''Sharp can no longer handle everything on its own, from R.&D. to design, production, procurement, sales and services,'' said Mr. Okuda. ''In the competitive global market, Sharp's vertically integrated model has reached its limit.'' Mr. Okuda, who previously led Sharp's global business, is set to take the president's job on April 1, replacing Mikio Katayama. Mr. Katayama was edged out and up to the chairman's post after Sharp in January projected its highest net loss ever -- 290 billion yen ($3.5 billion) for the year through March -- hurt by a glut of LCD panels worldwide and a punishingly strong yen. Tuesday's deal calls for Hon Hai to take a stake of nearly 11 percent in Sharp. Sharp will issue 66.5 billion yen, more than $800 million, in new shares to Hon Hai, and will also sell the Taiwanese company a nearly 47 percent stake in a flat-panel television factory in western Japan where the two companies plan to make TV sets together. Mr. Okuda said Sharp would use the proceeds of the share issue to invest in new LCD technology, for which the company expects robust demand because of mobile devices. The two companies plan to jointly develop and produce a wide range of devices, including smartphones, Mr. Okuda said. Sharp's financial woes have been made worse by a 1 trillion yen bet on its state-of-the-art television factory in Sakai, near the western hub of Osaka, in 2009. But that investment weighed heavily on Sharp's finances, as demand for large panels slumped and inventory piled up. It remains unclear whether Sharp can rebuild a business to compete with the cheap capital and manufacturing muscle of South Korea's Samsung, for instance, or the innovation of Silicon Valley companies like Apple. But a recognition that it must outsource, or even discontinue, cheap mass-market products could be a step toward improving profitability. For Hon Hai, the deal with Sharp comes as further recognition of its dominance in global manufacturing. ''Sharp is one of the most recognized brands worldwide and is also the leader in R.&D.,'' said Hon Hai's chairman, Terry Gou, who addressed reporters in Tokyo in a video message. ''Hon Hai -- well, it's not a brand, but has an excellent manufacturing record.'' ''This is truly a winning alliance,'' Mr. Gou said. PHOTOS: Sharp's 80-inch LCD display.

201203,Morning Take-Out,"TOP STORIESWarning Flags Were Raised in MF Global Transfers  |  Some MF Global employees were aware of a shortfall in the firm's customer accounts days before the firm filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31, according to people involved in the case, a revelation that raises questions about why it failed to safeguard client money and whether it withheld information from authorities. One such indication came from an internal document suggesting that the firm was putting customer funds at risk on Oct. 27, an MF Global executive, Christine Serwinski, is expected to tell a Congressional panel on Wednesday. Specifically, the firm had burned through a buffer of its own money and was using the cash of customers who were trading overseas, according to one of the people involved in the case. Other employees in the firm's back office have also told lawyers that they knew of a potential deficit in customer accounts on Oct. 27, according to the people involved in the case. One employee on Oct. 30 told an outside firm that was reviewing MF Global's books that the brokerage firm was worried about a shortfall earlier in the week, according to one of the people involved in the conversation. Federal authorities are also investigating whether MF Global was improperly using customer money as early as August, one of the people involved in the case said.

201203,"Can CEO Revive BlackBerry? After Just Two Months as CEO, Thorsten Heins to Deliver Progress Report on Turnaround at BlackBerry Maker","TORONTO—Research In Motion Ltd.'s chief executive, Thorsten Heins, vowed to improve execution and marketing at the struggling maker of BlackBerry smartphones when he took the job two months ago. On Thursday, investors should get the first clue as to whether he'll be able to fulfill those promises as RIM reports fiscal fourth-quarter results. Some are hoping for a better sense of how the former Siemens AG executive plans to turn around the Waterloo, Ontario, company. Analysts are expecting a quarterly profit of 81 cents a share on $4.53 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc., down from reported earnings of $1.78 a share on sales of $5.6 billion a year ago. Since taking over, Mr. Heins has pushed to streamline RIM operations and has considered paring the number of BlackBerry models the company turns out, say people familiar with the situation. But he has also failed thus far to appoint a new chief marketing officer, one of his early pledges as CEO. ""People want to hear if [Mr. Heins] has a plan,"" says Ehud Gelblum, a managing director of research at Morgan Stanley. ""People would love to hear if there are any new ideas, because it is hard to figure out how they turn this around."" So far, investors haven't been impressed. RIM shares, after falling more than 75% and wiping away some $30 billion in market value through 2011, have fallen another 8% since Mr. Heins's appointment on Jan. 24. Mr. Heins was unavailable to comment but a spokeswoman said he ""has been meeting with customers, suppliers, analysts, partners, employees,"" and ""will be providing a business update when the company reports Q4 results on Thursday."" The company canceled a May meeting with analysts, pushing it to after the launch of BlackBerry 10. RIM continues to struggle with steep smartphone market-share erosion, amid competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhone and devices running Google Inc.'s Android operating system. RIM is also still mired in a costly and so far unsuccessful effort to break into the tablet market with its poor-selling PlayBook. Applications developers, meanwhile, have continued to shun both the BlackBerry and the PlayBook. A survey conducted by market-research firm IDC and Appcelerator, released last week, showed that only 16% of developers were ""very interested"" in creating apps for the BlackBerry or PlayBook, compared with 79% that were ""very interested"" in creating iPhone and iPad apps. Thursday's earnings and conference call with analysts will offer Mr. Heins an opportunity to emerge from the shadows of RIM's two, longtime co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. He took the reins after the two stepped down from their executive roles following months of pressure from shareholders. Messrs. Balsillie and Lazaridis remain big RIM shareholders and RIM directors. Mr. Heins, RIM's former chief operating officer and a former Siemens executive, has signaled he won't engage in any fundamental strategic shifts at RIM. His plan hinges on a successful rollout of RIM's next-generation smartphone, dubbed BlackBerry 10, and due this year. Meantime, RIM has ramped-up marketing for its current line of smartphones, called BlackBerry 7. But many analysts say they don't expect those efforts to have meaningfully increased sales of the phone in the latest quarter. Mr. Heins spent his initial weeks as CEO on the road, attempting to reassure carriers in the U.S., U.K. and Europe that RIM was still a viable company worth doing business with, and that its next line of phones would be a hit, according to people close to the company. Then he returned to RIM headquarters with the aim of streamlining operations. Part of that effort is considering reducing the number of BlackBerry models the company makes, according to these people. The company has been criticized in the past for making too many BlackBerry models, which could confuse consumers. The BlackBerry 7 line, for instance, comes in eight different models. Most analysts think RIM will come in below its guidance for revenue—between $4.6 billion and $4.9 billion in the quarter—and that sales of both older generation smartphones and the newer BlackBerry 7 devices will remain weak. Some analysts think that even sales in recent RIM regional strongholds such as Latin America may be weaker than in the past. There have been some signs of progress under Mr. Heins. RIM last month released an updated operating system for its PlayBook tablet that corrected the device's biggest failing by allowing users to access email without being tethered to a BlackBerry. Last week, RIM said it would offer apps developers a prototype of its next line of smartphones at a BlackBerry conference in May—a device that will allow them for the first time to test drive the BlackBerry 10 operating system. RIM has yet to set a launch date for the phone itself, though analysts don't expect to see it until late in the year. People close to the company say Mr. Heins has succeeded in instilling new focus at the company. Employees are ""all marching in the same direction now,"" toward developing the BlackBerry 10 smartphones, according to one person close to the company. ""Everyone has their heads down working—just 'get the job done' stuff,"" this person said. ""Which is quite a bit different from last summer when people didn't know whether they'd have jobs.""

201203,Nokia to Sell High-End Lumia in China,"BEIJING—Finnish phone maker Nokia Corp. is launching sales of its high-end Lumia smartphones in China in a move to gain market share in the world's largest smartphone market and to push forward the troubled company's turnaround. Nokia will begin selling its Lumia 800C, which runs with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Phone operating system and is supported by mobile carrier China Telecom Corp., in April for 3,599 yuan, or about $570, roughly within the range for a high-end phone in China. In the second quarter, the company will launch the introductory smartphone Lumia 610C to target younger audiences, said Stephen Elop, chief executive of Nokia, at a press event Wednesday in Beijing. Prices for the 610C haven't yet been set, a Nokia spokeswoman said. The company is also developing phones to work with the other two Chinese networks with which Nokia already has partnerships. ""China is critically important for Nokia,"" said Mr. Elop, adding that the company is designing phones and partnering with local Internet companies, such as Sina Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., to develop mobile products specifically for the Chinese market. The launch kicks off Nokia's effort to offer a smartphone that more easily taps into existing Web platforms, such as social-networking sites and instant-messenger programs. It comes as Nokia races to gain back market share that other companies, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., earned in the past year with more common smartphone software than Nokia's previous Symbian and MeeGo platforms. China is the world's largest smartphone market by some measures. Research firm Strategy Analytics said deliveries of smartphones to operators and retailers in China totaled 24 million units in the third quarter, compared with 23 million units in the U.S. It said Nokia had the largest smartphone share with 28%, but that Apple and Samsung are closing in fast. Analysts said offering cheaper Windows phones is key for Nokia's position in China and in its effort to turn around its business. The company also faces stiff competition with Chinese phone makers such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., which offer lower-end handsets with Google Inc.'s Android operating system for less than $200. The company plans to offer a wide variety of smartphones at various prices to satisfy all consumers, said Colin Giles, executive vice president of Nokia's global sales division. Analysts caution that Nokia will face a tough time posting strong growth. ""Nokia has already missed out on major growth, indicating that the road ahead will be challenging,"" said Andrew Milroy, head of research at market research firm Frost & Sullivan in Singapore. Mr. Giles said the industry is still in its infancy in China. Nokia aims to attract Chinese consumers by offering them exclusive applications and services, such as free downloads for popular videogames, like ""Fruit Ninja,"" and a year's worth of unlimited free music streaming. In the second quarter, the company also will launch two other Lumia phones, the 710 and 900, in the market, Mr. Giles said. A major marketing blitz, including television and digital advertising, is planned within the coming months to stir interest in the phone. ""We have a challenger mind-set,"" Mr. Giles said. ""We believe all we need to do is get customers' hands on the phone and they will see why they want it."" Write to Laurie Burkitt at laurie.burkitt@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Foxconn Gets Japan Foothold With Stake in Sharp,"TOKYO — In another sign of China’s manufacturing ascent as Japan struggles, the Taiwanese giant Foxconn Technology will become the largest shareholder in Sharp, a former exemplar of Japan’s electronics empire that has fallen on hard times. Besides giving Sharp an injection of cash, the Foxconn deal, announced here Tuesday, will aim to help the Japanese company restore profitability to its TV manufacturing and liquid-crystal display businesses. Sharp is a big maker of flat-panel television sets, and is still considered an innovator in liquid-crystal display, or LCD, technology. But the company is hemorrhaging money. And, like its compatriots Sony and Panasonic, Sharp has lost ground to more nimble South Korean companies like Samsung and LG. Headquartered in Taiwan, Foxconn has become a world leader on the strength of its sprawling factory campuses on the Chinese mainland. It is primarily a contract manufacturer, with premier clients that include Apple for which it makes iPads and iPhones. Foxconn, whose formal name is the Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, has repeatedly come under scrutiny for the labor practices that enable it to crank out products at high volume and low cost. In response to reports of suicides at Foxconn’s plants and accusations that it forces employees to work grueling shifts under sometimes dangerous conditions, Apple has hired a nonprofit group, the Fair Labor Association, to investigate. The association, which is examining Apple’s various suppliers, is expected to release its report soon. China, which long served Japanese industry primarily as a low-cost operating base for manufacturing, is now bringing its money and methods to Japan. Last year, a Chinese company bought the washing machine and refrigerator manufacturing business of Sanyo Electric. Chinese manufacturers have recently agreed to build a plastics plant and a heavy machinery factory in western Japan. And in 2011, for the first time, the number of mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in Japan exceeded those by American businesses. Even if Sharp does not fully adopt Foxconn’s methods after the investment, the Japanese company’s manufacturing model could benefit from streamlining. Japanese manufacturers have long clung to a vertically integrated approach in which they try to make most of their products in-house. It is a business model that served companies like Sharp well in the 1980s and 1990s, but more recently has been overtaken by electronics companies that outsource most of their manufacturing. Especially in high-cost Japan, vertical integration is strangling profitability, Sharp’s incoming president, Takashi Okuda, said Tuesday. “Sharp can no longer handle everything on its own, from R.&D. to design, production, procurement, sales and services,” said Mr. Okuda. “In the competitive global market, Sharp’s vertically integrated model has reached its limit.” Mr. Okuda, who previously led Sharp’s global business, is set to take the president’s job on April 1, replacing Mikio Katayama. Mr. Katayama was edged out and up to the chairman’s post after Sharp in January projected its highest net loss ever — 290 billion yen ($3.5 billion) for the year through March — hurt by a glut of LCD panels worldwide and a punishingly strong yen. Tuesday’s deal calls for Hon Hai to take a stake of nearly 11 percent in Sharp. Sharp will issue 66.5 billion yen, more than $800 million, in new shares to Hon Hai, and will also sell the Taiwanese company a nearly 47 percent stake in a flat-panel television factory in western Japan where the two companies plan to make TV sets together. Mr. Okuda said Sharp would use the proceeds of the share issue to invest in new LCD technology, for which the company expects robust demand because of mobile devices. The two companies plan to jointly develop and produce a wide range of devices, including smartphones, Mr. Okuda said. Sharp’s financial woes have been made worse by a 1 trillion yen bet on its state-of-the-art television factory in Sakai, near the western hub of Osaka, in 2009. But that investment weighed heavily on Sharp’s finances, as demand for large panels slumped and inventory piled up. It remains unclear whether Sharp can rebuild a business to compete with the cheap capital and manufacturing muscle of South Korea’s Samsung, for instance, or the innovation of Silicon Valley companies like Apple. But a recognition that it must outsource, or even discontinue, cheap mass-market products could be a step toward improving profitability. For Hon Hai, the deal with Sharp comes as further recognition of its dominance in global manufacturing. “Sharp is one of the most recognized brands worldwide and is also the leader in R.&D.,” said Hon Hai’s chairman, Terry Gou, who addressed reporters in Tokyo in a video message. “Hon Hai — well, it’s not a brand, but has an excellent manufacturing record.” “This is truly a winning alliance,” Mr. Gou said.

201203,RIM cuts prices of some BlackBerry models in India,"NEW DELHI, March 28 (Reuters) - BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion has cut prices of some of its smartphone models in India by up to 27 percent, in a move to boost sales in the world's second-biggest mobile phone market. India is one of the few growing markets for RIM, which is facing tough competition from Apple Inc and high-end devices on Google Inc's Android platform used by a range of handsetmakers, including Samsung Electronics . RIM said on Wednesday it cut prices of four of its smartphone models, including the entry-level Curve 8520, which is its best-selling smartphone model in India. Sunil Dutt, managing director for RIM's Indian operations, said the four models accounted for about 60 percent of the company's sales in India, where BlackBerry devices have gained popularity among the youth. The price cuts are aimed at making the phones ""more accessible to a wider number of consumers in the country"", Dutt said in a phone interview. RIM does not disclose country-specific shipment figures. India's CyberMedia Research estimates RIM ranked third last year with a 15 percent share of the country's smartphone market, trailing Nokia's 38 percent market share and Samsung's 28 percent. Smartphones currently account for just over 6 percent of total handset sales in India, a market which is extremely price sensitive and most use their phones only for voice calls and text message. But the segment grew 87 percent last year to 11.2 million phones shipped, according to CyberMedia. RIM cut the maximum retail price of the Curve 8520 model by 18 percent to 8,999 rupees ($180) and that of Torch 9860 model by 26.7 percent to 21,990 rupees. The other two models whose prices were cut are Curve 9360 and Curve 9380.

201203,UPDATE 2-China's ZTE profits slide on weak telecoms spending,"* Q4 net profit slides 48 pct * FY net down 37 pct on weak telco spending, forex losses * 2011 revenue 86.3 bln yuan, up 23 pct * Shares down 13 pct in last two weeks (Adds revenue in paragraph 7, Iran context in paragraph 10) By Lee Chyen Yee and Yuntao Huang HONG KONG, March 28 (Reuters) - China's ZTE Corp , the world's fourth-largest handset producer and fifth-ranked telecoms equipment maker, posted a third straight fall in quarterly profit mainly due to weak telecoms spending and foreign exchange losses. ZTE and bigger crosstown rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have diversified from selling just telecom network gear, where growth has slowed, into consumer electronics gadgets such as smartphones and tablet PCs. ZTE's October-December net profit slid to 991 million yuan ($157 million), down 48 percent from 1.89 billion yuan a year earlier, and way below a forecast for 2.16 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations using unaudited figures for the first nine months. China's big telecom operators, though, are expected to spend around 350 billion yuan ($53 billion) this year on upgrading and expanding their 3G technology, up 9 percent from last year and outpacing the industry average of around 5 percent, analysts have said. That would benefit ZTE, which with Huawei, owns half the core infrastructure telecoms equipment market in China. ""The worst should be over for ZTE,"" said Huang Leping, an analyst with Nomura Securities. ""China's telecom carriers are actively spending this year. We've got China Unicom increasing its capex by a third and China Mobile spending on its networks where it will need equipment in areas where ZTE is strong."" ZTE, which listed on the Shenzhen stock market in 1997 and in Hong Kong in 2004 but whose largest shareholder is a Chinese state-owned enterprise, ranks behind Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia Siemens Networks and Alcatel Lucent and in telecoms equipment, and trails just Nokia Oyj , Samsung Electronics and Apple in handsets. Full-year net profit fell 36.6 percent to 2.06 billion yuan, lagging a forecast for 3.23 billion yuan from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 23 analysts. Annual revenue increased 23 percent to 86.3 billion yuan ($13.68 billion). ""Our company's profit margins and net profit have fallen significantly because of a slowing global economy (and) adjustments in domestic monetary policy,"" ZTE said in a statement. ZTE sells equipment in more than 140 countries and derives around half its sales overseas, making its yuan-denominated earnings vulnerable to the weakening of the euro and other currencies such as the Brazilian real. Reuters reported last week that ZTE entered a $131 million contract with the Telecommunication Co of Iran in December 2010 that sources said included a surveillance system capable of monitoring telephone and Internet communications. On Tuesday ZTE said it was no longer seeking to expand in Iran. ZTE, which recently launched the Android-based Optik tablet with partner Sprint Nextel for the U.S. market, is focusing on raising margins on its telecoms gear and handsets, where it has been chasing market share by marketing low-cost smartphones at below 1,000 yuan ($160) each. ""It's worth noting that pricing pressure is easing in China's infrastructure market, indicating the strategy may work in 2012,"" said Qin Zhang, an analyst with J.P. Morgan wrote ahead of the earnings release. ZTE shares, valued at $9 billion, have slumped 13 percent in the past two weeks, lagging Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index, which is down more than 2 percent over the same period, as investors cooled on ZTE's earnings outlook.

201203,UPDATE 4-Nokia seeks to retake China market share,"* Two models for China market unveiled * China Telecom to be first carrier, others planned * Models for China Unicom network to go on sale in Q2 * China is key market, Apple CEO also in Beijing (Adds China Unicom, updates share move) By Terril Yue Jones and Tarmo Virki BEIJING/HELSINKI, March 28 (Reuters) - Nokia will start to sell smartphones using Microsoft software in China from April, seeking to claw back market share gobbled up by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co. China has become one of the hottest markets for smartphone makers, with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in Beijing this week for talks with government officials amid problems ranging from labour issues to a contested iPad trademark. Nokia's push in China will be an important test for the Windows Phone, which has so far had limited success in Europe and the United States. The world's largest cellphone maker by volume is reliant on Windows after dumping its own software platforms last year. Nokia Chief Executive Stephen Elop unveiled two models based on the Lumia 610 and Lumia 800 smartphones. The Lumia 800C will be sold without a carrier contract for 3,599 yuan ($573) from April. Pricing for the cheaper 610C model, to launch in China in the second quarter, will be announced later. The two models will use CDMA technology of China Telecom , the nation's third-largest carrier. Nokia plans to bring all four Windows Phone models to the Chinese market in the second quarter and also adopt China Unicom's wireless technology. Nokia Windows Phones will eventually run on all three of China's mobile networks including China Mobile, said Colin Giles, Nokia's global sales chief, although he declined to elaborate on timing. ""We've invested heavily in China,"" Giles told reporters. ""We're creating innovation in China for China, which a number of our competitors aren't doing."" POSITIVE MOVE Shares in Nokia rose 3 percent to 4.116 euros, helped also after Sweden's Swedbank lifted its rating to ""buy"" from ""neutral"". ""This is an encouraging step into the burgeoning China market,"" said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight in London. Nokia has lost its No. 1 position in the Chinese mobile handset market to Samsung, with Samsung at 24.3 percent and Nokia 19.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, according to market researcher Gartner. China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE stood at 12.6 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively, with Apple at 7.5 percent. ""Nokia and Microsoft's biggest challenge this year will be getting heard above the noise of Apple's iPhone, which has also launched recently on the same China Telecom network for the first time,"" said Neil Mawston of researcher Strategy Analytics. From 2010 to 2011, Nokia saw its share of the Chinese market shrinking to 30 percent from 70 percent, according to Strategy Analytics. Microsoft has the backing of Nokia for its Windows Phones, but is struggling to get equal support from other handset makers such as Samsung, which are focused on their Android offerings. Microsoft's share of the smartphone market fell to just 2 percent last quarter, from 3 percent a year ago and 13 percent four years earlier, Strategy Analytics said.

201203,New General Motors smartphone app could mean the end of car navigation systems,"DETROIT (AP) - General Motors soon will sell a $50 smartphone application that could replace your dashboard navigation system. The company said Wednesday that the app, called GoGo Link, will project smartphone navigation systems onto a dashboard touch screen. Drivers can control the system with the touch screen and listen to voice directions through the car's speaker system. The screen also will show maps. The app works with iPhone or Android systems. It will be available later this year on Chevrolet's 2013 subcompacts, the Spark and Sonic. Smartphones have had global positioning systems and navigation apps that give turn-by-turn voice directions for at least two years, but they were tough to use in a car because the maps are small and it's sometimes hard to hear the voice directions. The app, made by EnGIS Technologies Inc. of South Korea, has a lot of the features of in-dash car systems that cost more than $1,000. There is a bit of a catch. To get the app to work, cars have to have Chevrolet's MyLink touch screen system, which is coming out in new models. GM would not say how much MyLink would cost. It comes standard on some more costly models but is an option on lower-level models. GM decided to sell the app after doing research on potential Spark and Sonic buyers, said Sara LeBlanc, GM's global infotainment manager. Ninety percent of Spark and Sonic buyers own smartphones. They told GM that they wanted to use navigation systems from their phones because they don't have the money to pay for a car system. She wouldn't say directly if the app will be available in more GM vehicles, saying that customers will make the decision. ""This is new territory for us here at Chevy,"" she said. ""Navigation is going to continue to evolve."" GM plans to show off GoGo Link at the New York International Auto Show starting next week. The Sonic already is on sale, with the 2013 model coming this summer. The Spark, Chevrolet's smallest car, goes on sale in the summer as well. 5 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"Struggling Nokia launches first China smartphone, hoping to drive global turnaround","BEIJING (AP) - Struggling cellphone maker Nokia Corp. launched its first smartphone for China on Wednesday, looking to the world's biggest mobile market to help drive its 1-year-old turnaround effort. Nokia said its Lumia 800C will be supported by China Telecom Ltd., one of the country's three major state-owned carriers. The Finnish company, once the global industry leader, launched a corporate turnaround effort after falling behind Apple Inc. and other competitors in tapping into the popularity of smartphones. China is the world's biggest mobile phone market with about 900 million accounts, and is Nokia's biggest market. Nokia is one of China's most prominent brands but its market share has slipped amid intense competition from Apple's iPhone and phones made by South Korea's Samsung and other rivals. ""China is critically important for Nokia,"" CEO Stephen Elop said at a product debut held in an aircraft hangar-size tent with pop music and dancers. He was joined on stage by the China Telecom chairman, Wang Xiaochu. Colin Giles, Nokia's executive vice president for global sales, pointed to the rollout of four Lumia models over the past year as evidence of the company's revival. ""We've been demonstrating innovation and some leadership as well,"" Giles told reporters after the event. ""We are changing and transforming ourselves as we go."" Chinese consumers are increasingly important to global electronics and other brands as their spending rises at a time of economic malaise in the United States, Japan and Europe. Free-spending Chinese gadget lovers bought 70 million smartphones last year and sales are forecast to rise by 45 percent this year, according to Analysys International, a research firm in Beijing. ""Even a part of that would make a substantial market for any of these players,"" said David Wolf, a technology marketing consultant in Beijing. ""It could be the one factor that ensures survival."" Globally, Nokia also has been squeezed by phones running Google Inc.'s Android system and by lower-end Asian manufacturers. Its market share plummeted to below 30 percent last year from 40 percent in 2008. Nokia announced this year it would stop assembling phones in Europe by year-end and shift production to Asia. It announced 4,000 job cuts on top of nearly 10,000 layoffs last year. In China, the Lumia 800C will go on sale in early April for 3,599 yuan ($570), according to Elop. Nokia and China Telecom plan to release a lower-priced model, the 610C, aimed at students and other budget users, according to Elop. He said the Lumia 900C and the 710C sold in other markets also will be brought to China over time. Nokia also will roll out Lumia models for the networks of China's two other major carriers, China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom Ltd., said Colin Giles, Nokia's executive vice president for global sales and manager of its China unit until 2010. The Lumia 800C will run on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Phone, giving that system its first major exposure in a Chinese market dominated by iPhones and Android. In the United States, AT&T Inc. announced Monday it will sell the Lumia 900 running Windows Phone for $100 with a two-year contract. Giles expressed confidence Nokia can make up for its late entry into China's smartphone market on the strength of an extensive retail presence and close ties with local developers of services that form a large part of the appeal of smartphones. Nokia has formed partnerships with leading Chinese Web companies such as search engine Baidu and portals Sina, Sohu and Tencent to create services. The company says it and Microsoft will provide financing for entrepreneurs to develop Windows Phone-based applications. ""We're creating innovation in China for China, which some of our competitors are not doing,"" Giles said. Nokia phones are sold in some 200,000 retail outlets in China including the company's own stores and other distributors, according to Anna Shipley, its communications director for China, Japan and Korea. Giles said the company plans an extensive marketing campaign on television and online. Nokia has a stronger brand in China than it does in the United States but will need to revitalize sales and relations with retailers who have seen demand for its products falter, said Wolf, chairman of Wolf Group Asia. ""They've got a lot of work ahead of them,"" he said. ------ Online: http://www.nokia.com 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,Digits / Insights from WSJ.com,"Apple's Siri is Popular -- But for a Few Functions Siri, how popular are you? New research set to be released this week found that 87% of those who own Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4S use at least one feature of its Siri voice-activated virtual assistant monthly. But most usage is across a relatively limited set of functions, according to consulting group Parks Associates, which surveyed 482 owners of the iPhone 4S, the only device to carry the service. Apple introduced Siri last fall with the 4S and has been advertising it as a way to differentiate the hit device from other smartphones. The technology can perform a variety of tasks, such as searching for information, sending an email or scheduling meetings by voice. Unlike other types of voice-activated services, Siri can understand the way humans speak normally. Commanding it to ""wake me up at 9 a.m."" can set the iPhone's alarm, for instance. Making phone calls and sending text-messages are the most popular activities, according to the report, a sign that Siri usage is mirroring how people use their phones more generally. Roughly a third of 4S owners use Siri to place phone calls, send text messages, or look up information daily or almost daily. Many other Siri services -- such as playing music and scheduling meetings -- are getting little pickup. Some 32% and 35% of 4S users, respectively, said they had never used Siri to play music or schedule meetings. Those two categories also had some of the lowest percentage of daily or almost daily users. Email usage is pretty split, with 30% saying they have never used Siri to send an email while 26% say they use it to send email daily or almost daily. The pattern comes as users continue to complain that Siri struggles to understand accents and needs dead quiet in order to work. An Apple spokeswoman didn't return a request for comment. -- Jessica E.

201203,Business Highlights,"------ Justices signal deep trouble for health care law WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fate of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul was cast into peril Tuesday as the Supreme Court's conservative justices sharply and repeatedly questioned its core requirement that virtually every American carry insurance. The court will now take up whether any remnant of the historic law can survive if that linchpin fails. The justices' questions in Tuesday's hearing carried deeply serious implications but were sometimes flavored with fanciful suggestions. If the government can force people to buy health insurance, justices wanted to know, can it require people to by burial insurance? Cellphones? Broccoli? The law, pushed to passage by Obama and congressional Democrats two years ago, would affect nearly all Americans and extend insurance coverage to 30 million people who now lack it. Republicans are strongly opposed, including the presidential contenders now campaigning for the chance to challenge Obama in November. ------ FTC seeks law to shed more light on data brokers NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is calling for a new law that would allow people to review the vast amounts of information being collected about them as the Internet, smartphones and other technology make it easier to create digital dossiers of just about anyone's life. It's an unusually tough proposal from a consumer protection agency that prefers to coax companies into adopting voluntary principles. Part of an online privacy report the FTC released this week, the suggestion comes a month after the Obama administration proposed a ""Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights"" and urged technology companies, consumer groups and others to work together on developing more safeguards. The FTC's 57-page report also touched on other topics: The agency said Congress needs to impose more limits on so-called ""data brokers,"" who profit from collecting and selling files information that can affect people's ability to get a job or find housing. Data brokers range from publicly traded companies such as Acxiom Corp. to a hodgepodge of small, regional service companies that with just a few employees. ------ US consumer confidence is roughly flat in March NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans' rosy outlook about the U.S. economy remains resilient as they focus on the good in the barrage of conflicting economic news. A widely watched barometer of consumer confidence barely budged in March from February's reading, which was its highest in a year. That was despite mixed economic signs. The stock market is up, but gas prices are, too. Unemployment is falling, but home prices also are too. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index slipped to 70.2 for March from a revised 71.6 for February. ------ Home prices fell in January in most US cities WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home prices fell in January for a fifth straight month in most major U.S. cities, as modest sales increases have yet to boost prices. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home-price index released Tuesday showed that prices dropped in January from December in 16 of 19 cities tracked. The steepest declines were in San Francisco, Atlanta and Portland. Prices increased in Miami, Phoenix and Washington. Price information for Charlotte was delayed and therefore not included in the report. ------ Enbridge to spend $3.8 billion on pipeline work CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Pipeline builder Enbridge Inc. is investing nearly $4 billion in a new round of construction that will increase the flow of Canadian oil sands crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Enbridge, Canada's largest transporter of crude, said Tuesday it will expand its Flanagan South Pipeline from Flanagan, Ill., to Cushing, Okla., to a 36-inch (.9-meter) diameter line with a capacity of 585,000 barrels per day. The Flanagan pipeline, expected to be in service by mid-2014, will be built along the route of Enbridge's existing pipeline from southeast of Chicago to Oklahoma. ------ FBI: Pennsylvania man stole Microsoft co-founder's identity PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An AWOL soldier's simple scheme to defraud one of the richest men in the world has landed him in federal custody, according to a criminal complaint. In the complaint unsealed Monday, federal investigators allege Brandon Lee Price changed the address on a bank account held by billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, then had a debit card sent to his Pittsburgh home so he could use it for payments on a delinquent Armed Forces Bank account and personal expenses. Price called Citibank in January and changed the address on an account held by Allen from Seattle to Pittsburgh, then called back three days later to say he had lost his debit card and asked for a new one to be sent to him, an FBI investigator wrote in a criminal complaint filed in February. The complaint doesn't specify how Price allegedly changed the address on the account. ------ Government finds airwaves for possible wireless data NEW YORK (AP) -- The federal government wants to alleviate data congestion on smartphones and other mobile devices by asking the Defense Department, NASA and other agencies to switch to new locations on the airwaves or share their existing frequencies with commercial networks. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that it has identified a band 95 megahertz wide that could be auctioned to wireless companies. That's enough to support at least two new national wireless data networks. The block is particularly desirable because it is near frequencies already available to cellphone companies. Freeing up the airwaves won't be easy, however. The military uses parts of that block for training and missile-guidance systems. Law enforcement agencies need it for video surveillance, and NASA and the Pentagon use it to operate unmanned aircraft. ------ United Airlines still leaving passengers on hold United Airlines passengers are having difficulty getting a reservations agent on the phone and experiencing other glitches, more than three weeks after a computer switchover was supposed to make things better. There were widespread reports of passengers waiting on hold to fix ticketing problems. Many reported that they couldn't get through at all. Odd balances were showing up in frequent flier accounts. United's website says it has ""extraordinarily high call volumes"" at its call centers, and that some hold times are more than an hour. The airline says it has solved most of the frequent flier problems, and that it is working to reduce hold times. ------ Walgreen fiscal 2Q profit slides nearly 8 percent Walgreen Co.'s fiscal second-quarter earnings fell almost 8 percent, knocked down largely by its exit from the Express Scripts pharmacy network, but the drugstore operator's results still topped analyst expectations, and its shares outperformed broader market indexes Tuesday. The nation's largest drugstore chain said its split with Express Scripts, a St. Louis-based pharmacy benefits manager, lowered its earnings by about 7 cents per share for the quarter that ended Feb. 29. A mild cold and flu season also affected earnings by about 3 cents per share. Express Scripts paid Walgreen to fill prescriptions, and the companies let their contract expire at the end of last year when they couldn't after months of talks failed to produce a new deal. Pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, run prescription drug plans and use large purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices. ------ Harry Potter breaks e-book lockdown NEW YORK (AP) -- The Harry Potter books are finally on sale in electronic form, and they have a special magical touch to them: In a break with industry practices, the books aren't locked down by encryption, which means consumers can move them between devices and read them anywhere they like. If ""Pottermore,"" J.K. Rowling's new Web store, proves a success, it could provide a model for other authors and publishers and undermine the clout of Amazon.com Inc., which dominates e-book sales. E-books from major publishers are sold in encrypted form today, tying them to specific devices or software programs. Publishers insist on encryption because they believe it stops piracy. It also helps e-book retailers like Amazon defend their business models, keeping non-Amazon books off Kindle e-readers. ------ By The Associated Press(equals) The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 43.90 points to close at 13,197.73, a loss of 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 3.99 points to 1,412.52. The Nasdaq composite fell 2.22 points to 3,120.35. Benchmark U.S. crude oil gained 30 cents to $107.33 per barrel. In London, Brent crude for May delivery fell 45 cents to $125.20 per barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. Natural gas futures fell 1.8 cents to $2.21 per 1,000 cubic feet after dropping 5 cents on Monday. That's a 10-year low and half of what natural gas was fetching back in July. In other energy trading, heating oil fell 1 cent to $3.22 per gallon and gasoline futures dropped 1.1 cents to $3.41 per gallon. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,Harry Potter and the Portable E-books: Rowling's website breaks with book industry practice,"NEW YORK (AP) - When the Harry Potter books finally went on sale in electronic form on Tuesday, it was as if Harry himself had cast the ""Alohomora"" spell on them -- the one that unlocks doors. In a break with industry practices, the books aren't locked down by encryption, which means consumers can move them between devices and read them anywhere they like. If ""Pottermore,"" J.K. Rowling's new Web store, proves a success, it could provide a model for other authors and publishers and undermine the clout of Amazon.com Inc., which dominates e-book sales. ""I think it's a very large crack in a dam that's going to collapse in the next nine to twelve months,"" says Matteo Berlucchi, the CEO of an independent British-based online bookstore, aNobii. E-books from major publishers are sold in encrypted form today. The text of a book is scrambled so that only authorized devices and software can read it. For instance, a book bought from Amazon can be read only on the company's Kindle e-readers and on its Kindle applications for smartphones, tablets and PCs. It can't be read on Barnes & Noble's Nook e-readers. Conversely, a book for the Nook can't be read on a Kindle. A book purchased from Apple Inc. can only be read on iPhones, iPod touches and iPads. Publishers insist on encryption in the form of ""Digital Rights Management,"" or DRM because they believe it stops piracy. It also helps e-book retailers like Amazon defend their business models, keeping non-Amazon books off Kindle e-readers. But when Rowling fans buy a book from Pottermore, they can download it in a variety of formats, including one that is not protected by DRM. They can be read by a wide variety of applications and devices. These books can be purchased once and then passed around to friends or shared with children. Wider sharing is dissuaded by visible and invisible ""watermarks"" inserted by Pottermore before the download, which identify the buyer. Charles Redmayne, CEO of Pottermore, says that ""Harry Potter"" books are probably the most pirated in the world already, even though --or rather because-- there have been no legal electronic versions until now. Fans have scanned or even re-typed the printed books to make them available in electronic form. ""We believe that people should have the right, once they've bought the book, to read it on any device that they chose to,"" says Redmayne. Of course, there's another reason Pottermore is going DRM-free. It wants to ""own"" the relationship with the customers -- the Potter fans -- rather than have them go to other retailers. And the only way to get onto all reading devices without dealing with the other retailers is to sell books without DRM. ""It's a very valuable thing to us to own that customer relationship. It gives us a tremendous opportunity to create new products that we can sell to those consumers around the Harry Potter brand,"" Redmayne says. Shatzkin thinks other authors are unlikely to copy Rowling and set up their own stores --Rowling is ""The Beatles"" of the literary world and an industry unto herself. But he believes publishers who can aggregate the works of many authors on their sites are going to figure out that they can bypass Amazon as long as they're willing to give up DRM. ""If you don't have DRM, it opens up strategies that aren't available to you if you insist on DRM,"" says publishing consultant Michael Shatzkin. ""The question is: is the fear of piracy greater than the fear of Amazon?"" Amazon is thought to account for about 60 percent of the e-books sold in the U.S. Barnes & Noble Inc. is the second-largest seller with around 25 percent. Berlucchi likens the state of the e-book industry to the one in the music industry before 2008. Music publishers insisted on protecting legally sold songs with DRM, but all they did was allow Apple to corner the market, he says, since tracks bought from other stores wouldn't work on iPods. ""It took five years from the launch of the iPod for the music industry to realize that they weren't achieving anything with DRM,"" Berlucchi says. Early in 2008, music publishers allowed Amazon to launch a music store with DRM-free songs. Apple's iTunes store went completely DRM-free the next year. Andi Sporkin, a spokeswoman for the Association of American Publishers, says DRM ""has value,"" enabling things like library lending of e-books (without DRM, there's no way to ""return"" an e-book). Going the route of the music industry and going DRM-free hasn't really been discussed in the publishing industry yet, she says. In the case of Pottermore, Amazon is collaborating, sending shoppers from its site to Pottermore if they search for ""Harry Potter"" books. Shatzkin believes this is because Amazon, faced with getting nothing from sales of Harry Potter books, likely decided it should be in on the game to at least get referral fees. Amazon didn't comment on its reasons for sending shoppers to Pottermore, nor would it confirm it gets referral fees. ------ Associated Press Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"New RIM CEO, as questions about company's future linger","TORONTO (AP) - The new chief executive of BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion will oversee his company's first earnings report after the market closes Thursday. WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Details from CEO Thorsten Heins on a strategic direction for the company and whether RIM can keep selling older models while it prepares to launch a next-generation smartphone at the end of the year. Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new BlackBerry 10 software platform, although many say it may be too late. Heins, formerly a little known chief operating officer who joined RIM four years ago from Siemens AG, replaced RIM's founders after the company lost tens of billions in market value. Heins has said a drastic change in strategy is not needed, even as the once iconic maker of the BlackBerry smartphone confronts the most difficult period in its history. Following the departure of Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, who stepped down as co-CEOs and co-chairmen in January, Heins assumed the top job at a time when Americans were abandoning their Blackberry's for flashier touch-screen phones like Apple's iPhone and various competing models that run Google's Android software. Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York, said it will be a bad sign if RIM doesn't meet its guidance of 11 million to 12 million units shipped in the quarter. ""The key to RIM surviving is them continuing to add subscribers while they transition to the new operating system,"" Misek said. Mike Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said RIM is in a tough spot with its product portfolio. Walkley said what the new CEO says about boosting sales of current models before BlackBerry 10 is released will be important. But Walkley said the new BlackBerry's will come out too late to reverse RIM's fortunes. ""Blackberry 10 could be a fantastic operating system, but will consumers even try it out and will app developers adopt it?"" Walkley said. WHY IT MATTERS: Just a few years ago the Canadian company was riding high when President Barack Obama refused to part with his BlackBerry after he took office. Although Blackberry's are cheaper than some of their rivals and remain popular internationally, RIM is struggling with delays in getting new phones out. In addition its PlayBook tablet computer has been a dud, and its stock price is at a five-year low. A company that was once worth more than $70 billion now has a market value of less than $8 billion. WHAT'S EXPECTED: RIM has said it expects fourth-quarter earnings will be in the range of 80 to 95 cents per share on revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet on average expect profit of 81 cents per share on revenue of $4.54 billion. For the current fiscal quarter ending in May, analysts expect $4.3 billion in revenue and earnings of 67 cents per share and earnings of $4.08 per share for the year. LAST YEAR'S QUARTER: RIM earned $710 million, or $1.27 per share, on revenue of $4.08 billion. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"PREVIEW-Same old, same old expected from RIM under new CEO","* Quarterly results are first under new CEO Thorsen Heins * Sales lift seen unlikely despite U.S. marketing push * Difficult to disappoint with expectations so low * RIM Q4 EPS seen at 81 cents on revenue of $4.54 billion * Short-interest in RIM's Nasdaq shares has risen sharply By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, March 27 (Reuters) - Research In Motion is likely to prove this week that it's much easier to install a new chief executive than it is to turn around a struggling company in his first quarter at the helm. Most investors and analysts aren't expecting much improvement from the company that makes the BlackBerry smartphone and the PlayBook tablet since Thorsen Heins replaced Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in January. Indeed, most have their sights set low, both for the quarter that ended March 3 and the outlook for the current three-month period. Little joy is expected at least until RIM launches its make-or-break next-generation phones later in the year. ""It's going to be a weak quarter,"" said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. ""It's going to continue to amplify fears"" that RIM will at some point find itself spending more than it's making, he said. ""I'm not sure they lose money this quarter, but I think it'll signal that that's the ultimate trajectory."" Heins has inherited a difficult situation to say the least. The smartphone maker's shares have tanked in the past year in the face of intense competition, a string of profit warnings, a service outage and the stumbling launch of the PlayBook a year ago. Canada's RIM, which mastered mobile email early and once dominated out-of-office corporate communication, has struggled to match Apple's iPhone and an army of devices using Google's Android operating system, both of which first won over consumers and now increasingly impinge on RIM's base of corporate users. The drum beat of bad news was unlikely to have slowed in the Christmas period, analysts warned, despite heavy U.S. marketing to promote the latest BlackBerry phones and a software upgrade and sharp discounts for its poor-selling PlayBook tablet. SHORT INTEREST RISE RIM is expected to barely reach the bottom end of its own lackluster BlackBerry shipment and earnings-per-share forecasts and to point to more of the same in the current quarter. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company has delayed an overhaul of its smartphone lineup until late 2012, giving investors little to look forward to until then. ""It would be nice to see them having a positive outlook and things progressing very well with BlackBerry 10,"" said Wedbush analyst Scott Sutherland, referring to the future handsets that will share the operating system RIM first used in the PlayBook. ""But given the past disappointments of product cycle misses, most of us won't believe it until we see it,"" he added. Highlighting the pessimism, short interest in RIM's Nasdaq stock jumped to more than 60 million shares, roughly 11 percent of RIM's outstanding shares, as of March 15. It was at 37.5 million at the end of 2011. Short-sellers profit by borrowing shares they believe will drop, selling them, buying them later at a lower price to repay the loan and pocketing the difference. Both Gauna and Sutherland said the only reason short-sellers may have to scramble to cover their bets is if Heins announces a radical restructuring or shift in strategy that would reawaken dormant takeover speculation. EARNINGS CUT IN HALF Analysts, on average, expect RIM to earn 81 cents a share on revenue of $4.54 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That would be less than half what it earned a year earlier and a roughly $1 billion drop-off in sales. Earnings for the current quarter, which began in early March, are seen at just 66 cents a share on revenue of $4.26 billion. RIM is expected to have shipped 11.2 million BlackBerry devices, according to a Reuters poll of 10 analysts, scraping in to the low-end of the company's own dismal outlook, and just 300,000 of its PlayBook tablets. Both numbers are set to fall in the current quarter, the poll showed. Even if RIM hits the high end of its Christmas quarter shipment target, it will ship fewer BlackBerrys in this fiscal year than the previous one, the first decline ever. SHIPMENTS SEEN FALLING FURTHER Worse, evidence is mounting that RIM's strongest weapons in the smartphone war - its traditional user base of office workers and its growth in developing countries - are losing momentum. The company's share of the global smartphone market fell to 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Gartner, down from 14.6 percent a year ago. Several U.S. government agencies have said they will remove the RIM servers that run their fleets of BlackBerrys or issue rival devices to their workers, as have a string of corporates. The company spent some $100 million in the quarter on a marketing campaign which sought to pique interest for its latest touchscreen BlackBerry 7 devices in the United States. Despite the promotional push, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Abramsky expects shipments there to fall by a third from the prior quarter. For the rest of the world he expects a 15 percent decline. RIM reports fourth quarter earnings after the close of trade on Thursday. Its shares were trading just above $14 on Tuesday morning, down some 80 percent from a peak near $70 in February last year.

201203,UPDATE 3-Apple CEO on China mission to clear up problems,"* China is Apple's biggest potential market * Company losing ground to Samsung smartphones * iPad trademark dispute clouds future sales * Latest iPad version not yet released in China * iPad hits snag in Australia (Recasts lead, adds Cook meeting with vice premier, other officials) By Lee Chyen Yee and Terril Yue Jones HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 27 (Reuters) - Apple chief executive Tim Cook on Tuesday held talks with government officials in China, where development of the company's biggest potential market is clouded by issues ranging from a contested iPad trademark to treatment of local labour. Cook, on his first trip to the country since taking over from Steve Jobs in August, has said Apple has merely scratched the surface in China as it looks to expand. Apple has only five stores although it also retails through more than 100 resellers. China is the world's largest mobile market and already Apple's second-biggest market overall, but Apple has been losing ground to arch rival Samsung Electronics in smartphones and has yet to introduce the latest version of its top-selling iPad to the country. In the last quarter of 2011, Apple captured three quarters of China's tablet PC market, while its iPhone ranked fifth in the country's smartphone sector, industry figures show. Cook's closely guarded itinerary in China, his company's biggest manufacturing hub, has included talks on Monday with Beijing's mayor and a visit to one of Apple's two stores in the capital. ""Tim is in China meeting with government officials. China is very important to us and we look forward to even greater investment and growth there,"" said Carolyn Wu, China spokeswoman for the maker of iPhones, iPads and iPods. She declined to give details but industry sources said Cook met with Vice Premier Li Keqiang, a vice commerce minister and officials of the National Development and Reform Commission. CHINA GROWTH Apple has tie-ups with China Telecom and China Unicom to sell its iPhone, with the only other Chinese carrier, China Mobile, also looking to clinch a deal. An alliance with China Mobile, the country's biggest mobile operator, is viewed by many industry analysts as crucial to the acceleration of iPhone sales through China. But Apple is also waging a legal battle with a Chinese firm over the local rights to the iPad trademark. The long-running dispute with Proview - a financially weak technology company that claims to have registered the trademark - is making its way through Chinese courts and threatens to disrupt iPad sales. Proview executives declined to comment on Tuesday over whether they will meet Cook. No meetings have been set so far between the Apple chief and the Chinese company's lawyers and creditors, sources familiar with the situation said. Hejun Vanguard Group, a consulting company representing Proview creditors, said it was willing to fight the trademark case for ""five, 10 years or even longer."" ""We will see how long the biggest company in the world can exploit the law and intellectual property rights in China,"" it said. Apple has not launched its new iPad in China yet but the new gadget has been smuggled in from the United States, Australia and Hong Kong. The device hit a hurdle in Australia where the consumer regulator on Tuesday accused Apple of misrepresenting the iPad's ability to connect to fast 4G mobile data networks and said it would seek corrections in advertising and refunds. Apple is also reviewing labour standards at the Taiwan firm which assembles its iPhones and iPads, Foxconn Technology Group, which has been accused of running sweatshops in China. The group is the Taiwan parent of Hong Kong-listed Foxconn International Holdings and Taiwan-listed Hon Hai Precision. An activist group based in Hong Kong - Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour - called on Apple to ""ensure decent working conditions at all its suppliers."" Apple has begun releasing monthly labour data and said it reached 89 percent compliance with its 60-hour work week policy in February, up from 84 percent in January, according to a survey of 500,000 workers at suppliers worldwide. ""That's a substantial improvement over previous results, but we can do better,"" the company said on its website.

201203,Nokia to Sell Lumia Smartphone in U.S. for $99.99,"Nokia Corp. will begin selling its high-end Lumia 900 smartphone in the U.S. next month for $99.99, a critical offering from the beleaguered mobile-phone maker. Nokia is in a turnaround plan in which it agreed last year to use Microsoft Corp.'s Windows mobile software. Sales of Nokia's initial Windows products, which were released in October in Europe, have been mixed, according to analysts. The Finnish company today has essentially no presence in the high-end U.S. smartphone market. How the Lumia 900 is received will offer the first sign of whether Nokia can gain traction in the U.S. The handset will be sold exclusively by AT&T Inc. in North America and available for preorder starting Friday. Nokia introduced the phone this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas but didn't disclose the price. Nokia swung to a fourth-quarter loss of €1.07 billion ($1.42 billion) from a profit of €745 million a year earlier. The latest results were dragged down by €1.43 billion in charges and write-downs. Sales fell 21% to €10 billion. Nokia's American depositary shares were up five cents at $5.34 Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

201203,NFC phone sales to jump to 100 mln in 2012-research,"March 26 (Reuters) - Some 100 million cellphones using Near-field Communication (NFC) technology will be sold this year, with sales more than tripling from a year ago, research firm Berg Insight said on Monday. Handset vendors released more than 40 NFC-enabled models in 2011, hoping to tap emerging market for mobile payments. NFC enables data to be exchanged wirelessly over distances of a few centimetres, meaning mobile phones can be used to pay for goods, store electronic tickets, download music and swap photos and business cards. Berg Insight said it expects the global market for NFC phones to grow to 700 million phones in 2016 from 30 million in 2011.

201203,Windows Phone struggles to break catch-22 as app makers hold off,"* Consumers demand apps; app makers need sales to make apps * Microsoft, Nokia launch 18 mln-euro app development program * Talking Tom Cat maker says no plans for Windows Phone By Tarmo Virki and Supantha Mukherjee March 26 (Reuters) - Apps, apps, apps! That is the main challenge that Microsoft and Nokia, who are trying to claw back marketshare from Apple Inc's iPhone and Google's Android in the red hot smartphone market, face now. And so far the going does not look too good for the challengers and their warhorse Windows Phone platform. Apps, short for applications, are small pieces of software that do useful or fun things on cellphones. The huge number and variety of apps in Apple and Google stores are a key factor that has helped the companies emerge as dominant players in the lucrative smartphone market. On Monday, Microsoft and Nokia said they would invest a total of 18 million euros ($23.9 million) into a new mobile application development program, AppCampus, at Helsinki's Aalto University during the next three years. The move underscores the seriousness with which the two companies view the problem. Most popular global apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and Evernote are available on the Windows Phone platform, but makers of many niche or local apps have shied away. The number of apps available in the Windows Phone Marketplace now exceeds 65,000, surpassing those at another rival Research in Motion's BlackBerry store. But that is still far short of around half a million apps available on the AppleApp Store and Google Play, according to app researcher Distimo. Worse still, only 37 percent of developers are keen to make apps for Windows Phone, showed the latest IDC/Appcelerator survey. That number, slightly down from the previous survey, compared with the 89 percent interested in iPhone and 79 percent in Android phones. ""Mobile developers' interest for the Windows platform has been for the least very lukewarm over the last two years, with no sign of improvement,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu said. Microsoft launched its latest Windows Phone 7.5 operating system, Mango, last year to good reviews. And Nokia, struggling to reclaim smartphone handset marketshare from nimbler rivals such as Apple and Samsung Electronics, l au nched its Lumia line of phones running on Mango late last year. Lumia phones look sleek and spiffy, with live, tiled icons that automatically update news, weather, pictures and social feeds. But the fewer number of apps and their quality are hobbling the phones' appeal to customers. Finn Christian Lindholm, a Helsinki-based partner at digital design agency Fjord, believes the latest Windows Phones are interesting enough to challenge the iPhone. The key to both companies' strategy to gain in the smartphone market would be how they break out of the vicious cycle -- the low sales of the Windows phones holding back app makers, and consumers shunning the phones for lack of the apps they are accustomed to. ""They need to break the Catch-22 before there is enough volume and natural pull,"" Lindholm said. SHRINKING MARKETSHARE Monday's announcement by Microsoft and Nokia is an attempt to find new solutions to the problem, in addition to paying third-party developers for the apps. They hope the program, which will provide support, coaching and also funding for app makers, will boost the number of unique and outstanding apps on Windows Phone. It's an uphill road for a new platform. Microsoft's share of the smartphone market fell to just 2 percent last quarter, from 3 percent a year ago and 13 percent four years earlier, according to Strategy Analytics. Last month, Windows Phone lost also its highly respected chief of developer relations, Brandon Watson, who left for Amazon.com Inc, which is taking on established players in the mobile devices market with its Kindle e-readers. Apart from Nokia, which has a lot riding on the platform, Microsoft has little support from other handset makers, such as Samsung, which are clearly focused on their Android offerings. That is not surprising as the other handset makers are struggling to sell their Windows Phone models. They, unlike Nokia, can only dream of payments from Microsoft for promoting and supporting its software. Last quarter, Microsoft paid $250 million to Nokia on this account. NO TALKING TOM CAT On Friday, Rovio, the maker of the wildly popular Angry Birds game, created a scare when media reports said the latest version of the game -- Angry Birds Space -- will skip the Windows platform. Rovio Chief Executive Mikael Hed later told Reuters that the company is working toward getting the game to Windows Phone but did not specify when it will be available. Showing how difficult a task that Microsoft and Nokia face, many small app developers, such as Outfit7 -- maker of the popular Talking Tom Cat app -- and Joby -- which makes a camera app -- said they have no plans to be on Windows Phone either. Pioneers in augmented reality -- a technology that combines the digital and real worlds, and is one of the hottest areas of wireless -- are also holding back. ""We have enough work in keeping Android and iPhone apps up to date, as well as in enhancing our augmented reality capabilities on them,"" said Maarten Lens-Fitzgerald, co-founder of Dutch-based augmented reality firm Layar. Jeff Janer, co-founder and CEO of Springpad, which makes the namesake app that allows users to store, organize and share content, raised the main concern of the app makers: Will the hard work to move to a new platform pay off? ""When considering a new platform, we look to balance cost of development and support against potential return in terms of market opportunity and the ability to cost-effectively reach the market,"" said Janer, who currently has no plans to develop an app for Windows Phone. For many small developers, it is a question of cost and how fast they can recoup the investment. It would probably take six man-months to build an app for Windows phone and if that was contract work it would be $60,000 or more, said Adam Saltsman, co-founder of Semi Secret Software, which makes the Wurdle word game. The small customer base for Windows Phone is forcing developers to charge more for the apps, turning off customers further. Most apps that are available for 99 cents on Google Play cost $2.99 on the Windows Phone Marketplace. Andreas Bernstrom, CEO of Rebtel, one of the most popular Internet-based calling applications on iPhone and Android, said the company has Windows Phone on its development roadmap for later this year but has not yet started work. ""I don't know what the market will be like in six months, maybe we need to focus on tablets or something else,"" he said. Jeffrey Glueck, chief executive of Skyfire Labs Inc, which makes the eponymous mobile Web browser, said the main driver for developing on Windows Phone will be carrier requests. ""So far, we're only getting requests around Android and iPhone."" That is one more challenge for Microsoft and Nokia.

201203,AT&T to sell Nokia Windows phone for $100,"NEW YORK (AP) - AT&T Inc. on Monday said it will sell the Lumia 900, its first Nokia Corp. smartphone that runs Windows Phone software, on April 8, for $100 with a two-year contract. The Finnish phone manufacturer is counting on Microsoft Corp.'s software to turn its fortunes around and provide it with an entry into the U.S. market. U.S. consumers were not interested in the Symbian software Nokia used for its earlier smartphones. AT&T, the country's No. 2 wireless carrier, said in January that it would carry the phone, but did not announce the price or launch date. On Monday, Dallas-based AT&T said it would also carry another Windows Phone, the Titan II from Taiwan's HTC Corp. It will cost $200. Both phones can use AT&T's new ""LTE"" wireless broadband network, for faster downloads. T-Mobile USA, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, already sells one of Nokia's Windows Phones. For Microsoft, the partnership with Nokia is a chance to break into smartphones, which are dominated by Apple and Google Inc., through its Android software. Other phone makers have also put out Windows phones, but sales have been slow. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,W.Va. lumber company to close after 82 years,"SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Pat Evans talked about closing the family business in the early 1990s, but his son knew his father couldn't bear it. He couldn't drive by the doors to Evans Lumber and see them locked tight. In his 75 years with the company, Walter D. ""Pat"" Evans never missed a day of work -- never missed an opportunity to walk through those doors. So, for Don Evans, now comes the time to do what his father never wanted to do. ""That'll be my job,"" Evans, 71, said, as he leaned back in his father's chair in the wood-paneled office that hasn't been touched since Pat Evans died in 1995. Evans Lumber Co. is closing at the end of the month after 82 years as a family-run business. The South Charleston lumber company and hardware store opened its doors in 1929 on the corner of D Street and Second Avenue. The sawdust will settle on March 30. Evans -- current president and a third-generation owner -- cited the economy as one reason he has to close his family's business. But the impact of big box stores -- Home Depot and Lowe's -- on independent family-owned stores like Evans Lumber is the main reason, he said. ""Independents are more sensitive to their customers' needs, where big box stores are sensitive to what product they can sell for a good profit. We're suffering from the very thing we pushed for so many years,"" Evans said. ""We have people who call our salespeople for questions, then buy (the product) at Lowe's."" Lumber companies are a dying breed, said Doug Fleener, president and managing partner at Dynamic Experience Group, a national retail-consulting firm. The locally owned lumberyard is a difficult business and has definitely been on the decline, Fleener said. ""I don't think we're going to continually see a large number of hardware stores,"" Fleener said. ""I think it's real sad that we lose independent businesses but there's always this interesting perspective if we look at our own shopping habits. There definitely has been a change in the consumer."" There are pricing transparencies in retail today, he said. Customers can stand in an independent store and check the price of the same item at a big box store on their smartphone, Fleener said. Evans said customers have changed and because of that he has to close Evans Lumber. At an independent store like Evans, customers are able to talk to someone they not only know, Evans said, but someone who can also answer their specific questions. ""People love that service but they don't understand that it cost more pennies to provide that service and that's why we're closing down,"" Evans said. ""Over the years we have done a good job educating customers with our high quality (knowledge) but there's a higher price and people only see the higher price."" In a January 1990 overview of Evans Lumber written by Pat Evans, the former president wrote, ""We take pride in being out of very few of our stock items ... A profit is not made on every item but we feel we owe the public something for the patronage they have given us. We do appreciate every customer and try to give fast, efficient, courtesy service."" The company's customer-comes-first motto has been that way since Evans' grandfather, W. A. ""Gus"" Evans, opened what was then called South Charleston Lumber Co. in November 1929, one month after the stock market collapse. When the glass-making plant where Gus Evans worked closed its doors, he focused on painting homes full-time. Gus quit painting to go into home building. He built many homes and apartments on Montrose Drive. With four other men, Gus Evans purchased an empty building and its surrounding property, adding more space and buildings as time went on, Evans explained. Though each man shared a stock worth $100 each, some of the men never paid and others ""dealt theirs out immediately in materials,"" Pat Evans wrote. Gus Evans remained owner until he died in 1950 of cancer. At 15, Pat Evans worked ""evening sometimes to 2 o'clock in the morning, unloading box cars, and go(ing) to school the next day. Our wages were not cash but went into stock. During the recession of 1932 and probably 1934, (Gus Evans) and I were the only employees, doing everything and working 12 to 16 hours a day before we were able to start hiring any help,"" Pat Evans -- who took over the business with his brother Leslie ""Les"" Evans when Gus passed away -- wrote in his 1990 recollection. The 1940s brought innovations for the lumber company, including changing the name to Evans Lumber Co. The company started a sawmill on their property that they eventually moved to its permanent location in Clendenin on the Elk River. On more than 5,000 acres of land, loggers produced mostly oak and poplar lumber. They stored their lumber stock in 131,000-square-feet of buildings on the 2.7 acres of their South Charleston location. If today's homeowners pulled up their carpet, they might notice an Evans Lumber stamp on the hardwood pieces -- a trademark that Evans said every piece of wood they manufactured acquired. Charles Newhouse, Jr. and his father both worked at Evans Lumber. The family-run business employed multiple family members, Evans said. Newhouse Jr., 70, started working in the dusty, loud shop on March 2, 1967, but he took on a number of jobs throughout his 44 years as an employee. He drove delivery trucks (another service the company offered), worked in the flooring room, and eventually became the shipping clerk. The fact that Evans -- a 1963 Marshall University business graduate -- has to close the company is the only reason Newhouse Jr. said he retired last fall. ""I hate to see it closed down, but I've got no control over that. Evans Lumber Company, they didn't treat me like an employee, they treated me like family and that's an advantage over the big box stores,"" Newhouse Jr. said. ""Lumber companies are a dying breed."" Evans Lumber once lived up to their ""everything to build anything,"" slogan, Evans said, but that hasn't been enough. Today, shelves that were once stocked with paint buckets, plumbing supplies and a wide selection of wood moldings are bare. In October, Evans sold all of the company's outside lumber and warehouse machinery. He sold a 1930s planer (a machine that makes the lumber smooth) that, until two months ago, he still used daily. He salvaged an antique, six-ton molding machine and four tons of old nails. The store's merchandise went on sale in February and customers can still get 50 percent off of everything until March 30. Evans said he plans to donate everything that isn't sold to a pre-selected charity. Closing a business his grandfather started more than 80 years ago wasn't an easy decision but a job that had to be done, he said. He has known for a couple years that Evans Lumber had to close but he waited so that the majority of his employees -- who have worked there 30 years or more -- could reach retirement age, he said. Evans also plans to retire and enjoy having time to mow his grass, ride his Harley Davidson motorcycle and go to the beach. ""It's the end of 82 years of history. I've been around the lumber company for 71 years, but this is just a job that had to be done,"" Evans said. ------ Information from: The Charleston Gazette, http://www.wvgazette.com 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"Corporate News: T-Mobile to Trim Jobs, Close Seven Call Centers","T-Mobile USA, reeling from an exodus of customers and the failure of its planned sale to AT&T Inc. last year, will cut 5% of its work force and close seven call centers as part of a broader restructuring that will stretch for the next three months. T-Mobile said the job cuts were necessary to help fund its $4 billion network upgrade to a faster mobile broadband service known as 4G LTE. The fourth-largest U.S. carrier and the only one without the Apple Inc. iPhone shed 1.7 million lucrative contract customers last year, even as its larger rivals AT&T and Verizon Wireless boosted their customer rolls. ""The customer base is less and the call volume is lower,"" said Cara Walker, a spokeswoman for the Bellevue, Wash.-based carrier. ""This is an effort to optimize our operations."" After walking away from its $39 billion deal, AT&T paid T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG $3 billion in cash and $1 billion in airwave licenses, or spectrum, that the carrier will use to help with its upgrade to 4G LTE. T-Mobile USA Chief Executive Philipp Humm has said the uncertainty surrounding the deal forced him to put strategic plans on hold. Ms. Walker declined to disclose the expected annual savings. She said further cuts wouldn't impact the remaining 17 call centers, engineers, technicians or salespeople in T-Mobile retail locations. The lack of the iPhone has hampered T-Mobile's ability to draw customers and keep the ones it has. But T-Mobile has said the high cost of subsidizing the devices -- Sprint Nextel Corp. had to commit to buying at least $15.5 billion worth over the next few years -- is an obstacle to offering it directly to its customers. Furthermore, T-Mobile's network technology isn't compatible with the popular smartphone and requires an upgrade. T-Mobile plans to spend an initial $1.4 billion through next year on building out 4G LTE, though it will be well behind AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which offer the service today. Sprint and Clearwire Corp. will introduce their first 4G LTE markets this year. The company hopes the network upgrades will help combat customer defections which rose to 3.1% in the fourth quarter from 2.5% a year earlier. That was more than triple the defection rate of the largest U.S. carrier, Verizon Wireless. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,WEEKAHEAD-View from editors in the Americas,"NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Following is the view from editors in the Americas on major news in the week ahead: * U.S. economic data highlights: durable goods, GDP * Next stop on U.S. presidential primary trail: Wisconsin * RIM, Best Buy report earnings * Reuters holds Metals and Mining Summit For Insider TV show on the week ahead, click here: http://link.reuters.com/deg37s DURABLE GOODS ORDERS, GDP DATA ON TAP With China slowing and Europe slipping into recession, the United States is one of the few bright spots for the world economy. Next week will give a fresher sense of whether the recovery has legs. Durable goods orders probably recovered in February, a good sign for manufacturing, after a surprise fall in January. Consumers have so far been reluctant to spend more heavily but can take heart from the pickup in jobs growth and rising share prices -- income and spending numbers are both seen rising when data for February is released on Friday. Economists will also keep a close eye on the final reading on fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. Data earlier this month showed a surge in spending at hospitals and led some economists to expect a possibly big upward revision. WALL STREET FOCUS ON ECONOMIC DATA Wall Street will focus on consumer confidence and durable goods figures, which could damp enthusiasm if they show weakness. However it would take a string of poor data to end the rally. Closing out its worst week of the year, the S&P was only down about half a percent for the last five days. A sharper pullback would be little surprise, but sentiment still favors buying on dips. Technical factors remain supportive, and the market is out of overbought territory after this week's mild losses. Bonds could come under pressure with $99 billion in Treasury auctions and the euro remains vulnerable to pullbacks after a surprising rebound this week. BERNANKE, OTHER FED OFFICIALS ON SPEAKING CIRCUIT Ben Bernanke has done his best to douse expectations in financial markets that the Fed might be rushed into raising interest rates before its latest guidance of late 2014. In a speech and two lectures to students next week, Bernanke might want to reinforce that message while probably sitting on the fence about the need for further stimulus as the U.S. economy shows signs of recovery. A host of other top Fed officials speak and may emphasize the stark differences among them about the best next steps for the central bank. U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MOVES ON TO WISCONSIN As Mitt Romney moves closer to the Republican nomination U.S. presidential election, candidates will step up campaign in Wisconsin, where Rick Santorum has what could be one of his last, best chances to stop the former Massachusetts governor. The Midwestern state, which votes on April 3, is a mix of the suburban and moderate Republicans who have backed Romney and the blue-collar and very conservative voters who prefer Santorum, and is the main battleground between the top two hopefuls. Many of the state's Republican voters, however, have been preoccupied with the June 5 recall election of polarizing Republican Governor Scott Walker. We will also be keeping an eye on Newt Gingrich and whether he will pull out of the presidential race. NEXT BIG HEART DRUGS? The annual American College of Cardiology meeting begins over the weekend. A possible revolutionary way to fight cholesterol is expected to cause a big stir among thousands of heart doctors gathering in Chicago. The new drugs in development by top pharmaceutical makers and up-and-coming biotechs are injectable medications that block a protein called PCSK9. Their biggest advocates say PCSK9 blockers have the potential to be the next multibillion-dollar class of heart drugs. BLACKBERRY MAKER REPORTS EARNINGS Another lackluster quarterly earnings report may come from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, whose most recently upgraded touch screen smartphones may not have made a major splash versus the latest iPhone and other high-end devices. While some analysts had predicted RIM would have to issue a second straight profit warning, most are also expecting a dismal outlook for the current quarter and limited upside until next-generation phones are launched, likely later in the year. The report, on Thursday, is new CEO Thorsten Heins' first, and he may provide detail on how heavy discounting and a software update for RIM's PlayBook tablet has helped boost its lowly sales. BEST BUY RINGS UP RESULTS Best Buy reports quarterly results on Thursday, and the electronics retailer may discuss whether its market share gains came at the expense of margins. Unlike the 2010 holiday season when it held the line on discounts and promoted only pricey goods, the world's largest consumer electronics chain offered deep discounts this time around. It promised to match any lower prices offered by its brick-and-mortar rivals and provided free shipping. REUTERS SUMMIT BRINGS TOGETHER TOP PLAYERS IN MINING, METALS Top players in the mining and metals industry gather to discuss topics at the Reuters Global Mining and Metals Summit in New York, London, Moscow, Toronto, Johannesburg, Jakarta, Tokyo, Seoul, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and elsewhere. A rebound in metals prices has lifted the mood in the metals and mining industry this spring compared with the gloom late last year when sharp market losses unsettled investors and hammered share prices. The economic backdrop brightened after fears eased about Europe's debt crisis, the United States showed signs of economic recovery and top metals consumer China avoided a hard landing. Investors are gun-shy, however, amid uncertainty about demand and after a roller-coaster ride last year saw benchmark industrial metal copper soar to record highs over $10,000 per tonne then shed 35 percent of its value. CHILEAN, MEXICAN INTEREST RATES Central banks in Chile and Mexico will release minutes of their last policy meetings when they left interest rates on hold. Both releases are due on Friday. Markets in Chile will look for confirmation that a surprise January rate cut was a one-off. They will also be looking for any sign that the bank could even be mulling a policy U-turn and hike borrowing costs later in the year after an uptick in inflation readings and expectations. Data has shown Chile's slowdown is more gradual than originally feared. In Mexico, the chance of a rate cut is receding further into the background after central bankers sounded more upbeat on growth at their last meeting. But inflation pressures are expected to remain low, meaning there is no need to tighten policy any time soon.

201203,Samsung picks MTS for Russian retail push,"MOSCOW, March 23 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics and MTS, Russia's top mobile phone operator, are teaming up as the South Korean handset maker pushes its fight for leadership on the Russian market. Samsung will open its own stores in Russia's biggest cities and sell its handsets and tablet computers on contract in MTS's 2,000 shops, the companies said on Friday. Samsung topped global smartphone sales rankings last year, more than quadrupling smartphone sales to 97.4 million from 2010, according to data from Strategy Analytics. In Russia, it has yet to overcome Finnish rival Nokia. Samsung's share of the Russian smartphone market almost tripled last year to 28.4 percent, mainly at the expense of Nokia, whose share decreased to 44 percent from 64 percent in 2010, according to MTS. Total sales of mobile handsets in Russia rose 16 percent in 2011 to 40.5 million units. Sales grew 12 percent to 174.8 billion roubles ($5.94 billion).

201203,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of (EURO)1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a (EURO)1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of (EURO)745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says net income fell 44 percent, while sales fell 7 percent in the first full quarter under new CEO Meg Whitman. Contributing factors included weak demand from consumers and the shortage in disk drives. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. reports strong earnings that validated its approach of delivering software and services over the Internet rather than on individual computers. Some of the initial enthusiasm cooled, though, after investors factored in growth from a change in billing frequency. Monday: Adobe Systems Inc. says its net income fell 21 percent, weighed by higher operating costs even as revenue climbed. Adobe booked $648 million in operating costs in the latest quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier due to higher sales, marketing and other expenses. Tuesday: Oracle Corp. says its earnings rose 18 percent despite meager revenue growth during the December-February quarter.

201203,A look at how selected makers of phones and other consumer electronics are faring,"A look at how selected makers of phones and other consumer-electronic gadgets are faring: Jan. 19: Microsoft Corp. says it shipped 8.2 million Xbox 360 video game consoles in the latest quarter, compared with 6.3 million a year earlier. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the latest quarter, double the figure of the previous quarter and more than twice as many as it sold in the holiday quarter of 2010. The iPhone 4S launched during the quarter, and Sprint Nextel Corp. joined as an iPhone carrier in the U.S. Apple shipped 15.4 million iPads in the quarter, again more than doubling sales from a year earlier. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. The company sold 21 percent fewer iPods, at 15.4 million. Jan. 26: Nokia Corp. says it sold 19.6 million smartphones in the quarter, down from 28 million a year earlier. That includes more than 1 million Lumia devices running Microsoft's Windows software. The Lumia 800 and Lumia 710 hit stores in Europe and Asia in November, while T-Mobile started offering the 710 in the U.S. in January. Nintendo Co. says worldwide sales of the 3DS handheld totaled 11.43 million in the last nine months of 2011. The company is now forecasting sales of 14 million machines for the fiscal year through March 2012, down from an earlier 16 million, despite an August price cut. Nintendo sold 9 million Wii machines during the nine-month period. It is now expecting to sell 10 million Wii machines in the year ending March, down from an initial estimate of 13 million, which was revised lower to 12 million in July. The company did not provide quarterly breakdowns. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. says it shipped 10.5 million mobile devices in the quarter, including 5.3 million smartphones and 200,000 tablet computers. A year earlier, the company shipped 11.3 million devices, including 4.9 million smartphones. Jan. 27: Samsung Electronics Co., maker of the Galaxy line of phones and tablet computers, doesn't disclose the number of smartphones it sells, but it says shipments rose by about 30 percent in the latest quarter, compared with the third quarter.

201203,"T-Mobile Cuts Jobs, Closes Call Centers","T-Mobile USA, reeling from an exodus of customers and the failure of its planned sale to AT&T Inc. last year, will cut 5% of its work force and close seven call centers as part of a broader restructuring that will stretch for the next three months. T-Mobile said the job cuts were necessary to help fund its $4 billion network upgrade to a faster mobile broadband service known as 4G LTE. The fourth-largest U.S. carrier and the only one without the Apple Inc. iPhone shed 1.7 million lucrative contract customers last year, even as its larger rivals AT&T and Verizon Wireless boosted their customer rolls. ""The customer base is less and the call volume is lower,"" said Cara Walker, a spokeswoman for the Bellevue, Wash.-based carrier. ""This is an effort to optimize our operations."" After walking away from its $39 billion deal, AT&T paid T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG $3 billion in cash and $1 billion in airwave licenses, or spectrum, that the carrier will use to help with its upgrade to 4G LTE. Chief Executive Philipp Humm has said the uncertainty surrounding the deal forced him to put strategic plans on hold. Ms. Walker declined to disclose the expected annual savings. She said further cuts wouldn't impact the remaining 17 call centers, engineers, technicians or salespeople in T-Mobile retail locations. The lack of the iPhone has hampered T-Mobile's ability to draw customers and keep the ones it has. But T-Mobile has said the high cost of subsidizing the devices—Sprint Nextel Corp. had to commit to buying at least $15.5 billion worth over the next few years—is an obstacle to offering it directly to its customers. Furthermore, T-Mobile's network technology is not compatible with the popular smartphone and requires an upgrade. T-Mobile plans to spend an initial $1.4 billion through next year on building out 4G LTE, though it will be well behind AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which offer the service today. Sprint and Clearwire Corp. will introduce their first 4G LTE markets this year. The company hopes the network upgrades will help combat customer defections which rose to 3.1% in the fourth quarter from 2.5% a year earlier. That was more than triple the defection rate of the largest U.S. carrier, Verizon Wireless. T-Mobile, which has about 36,000 employees, has said it is considering selling some of its cell towers, tapping capital markets or seeking funding from its vendors to help pay for its 4G LTE buildout. AT&T ended its bid to take over T-Mobile in December after facing resistance to the deal from the Justice Department, Federal Communications Commission, state attorneys general and some competitors.

201203,Business Briefs,"BANKING Credit Suisse Shuffles Investment-Bank Ranks Credit Suisse Group AG is appointing Jim Amine as sole global head of its investment-banking department, a unit that reports to investment-bank chief Eric Varvel. The appointment, announced in a memo and effective immediately, comes as department co-head Luigi de Vecchi is taking a sabbatical. Mr. de Vecchi plans to return to the bank in a senior role advising clients. In other senior appointments, the bank is naming Jamie Welch head of the Europe Middle East and Africa investment-banking department, reporting to Mr. Amine. Mr. Welch will keep his role at the top of the energy group, but share the role with Osmar Abib. Mr. Abib is adding this role to his current position as global head of oil and gas. Credit Suisse is also shuffling its global markets solutions group, which encompasses financing products and financing advisory business within the investment banking department. Tim Bock and Marisa Drew have been appointed as co-heads for this business. They will continue to be based in New York and London, respectively, reporting to Mr. Amine. -- Anita Greil --- TECHNOLOGY Nokia Completes Talks On Planned Job Cuts Nokia Corp., the world's largest handset maker by shipments, said Thursday it has completed negotiations with its labor unions over jobs cuts at its Salo plant in Finland. The cuts are part of a plan announced last month to cut about 4,000 jobs at smartphone manufacturing plants at Salo, Reynosa in Mexico and Komarom in Hungary, in a push to move device assembly closer to components suppliers in Asia. The company said it would shed 1,000 out of 1,700 jobs at Salo, and the lion's share of reductions will be implemented by the end of June with manufacturing and support jobs most affected. The size of the layoffs are in line with the number Nokia previously flagged. Last month's announcement takes the number of jobs losses at the handset maker over the past year to 13,800. As of Dec. 31 last year, Nokia employed slightly over 134,000 people. Slightly more than half of its staff work at Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture of Nokia and Germany's Siemens AG. Separately, NSN announced that it would cut about 630 jobs in Finland as part of a restructuring plan. The number is lower than the 1,200 figure previously announced. NSN is cutting 17,000 jobs globally to save 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in annual costs by 2013. -- Anna Molin and Sven Grundberg --- BANKING Sankaty to Buy Lloyds Loans Lloyds Banking Group PLC has agreed to sell U.K. leveraged loans with a face value of GBP 500 million ($793.7 million) to Sankaty Advisors LLC, a spokeswoman for Sankaty said. Under the deal, the bank will sell 26 loans to Sankaty, an arm of private-equity group Bain Capital, at a ""deep discount"" on the face value of the loans, a person familiar with the deal said. The amount paid for the loans wasn't immediately available. The sale is the latest effort by the part-government-owned bank to shrink businesses not considered core to its activities and to cut its roster of loans. Lloyds became heavily exposed to private-equity leveraged loans following its purchase of HBOS in 2008. -- Max Colchester License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Restocking the Old Machine,"Long a cultural icon, the vending machine is fading from the American landscape. The numbers are bleak: Traditional vending machines disappeared from 134,000 locations between 2007 and 2010, according to the latest available data from Vending Times, an industry publication. Sales from vending machines sank more than 11%, to $42.2 billion in the same period. Amid the changes, a new group of entrepreneurs is trying to build a new vending industry, outfitting machines with high-tech features, and filling them with live bait, prescription drugs, electronics and even art. Machines selling quirky products likely account for less than 5% of all vending machines, but that hasn't stopped the entrepreneurs from trying. Norman VanConia of Morgantown, Pa., was more than a little skeptical the first time he saw a live-bait vending machine, in 2009, installed at a gas station not far from home. The night crawlers -- $3.50 a dozen, $6 for 24 -- were on the second row, above the minnows and below the mealworms. But the juicy critters ""were in good condition and I have used them ever since,"" says Mr. VanConia, noting that the machine saves him a 20-mile trip to the bait shop. His response is typical, says Gary Harsel, who started PA Live Bait Vending in Elverson, Pa., as a supplement to his tackle shop. ""The first year I put the machines out, [customers] couldn't grasp the concept,"" says Mr. Harsel. He sold the company to Big Rock Sports LLC last summer and today more than 400 live-bait machines are operating. Matt Kurtz, who services 28 live-bait machines in the vicinity, regularly rotates the containers, allowing the worms to burrow down, and replaces the water for the minnows. He worries mostly about power outages, which disrupt the refrigeration. When that happens, ""bait leaks through the cups and you will lose a month to two months of work to regain what you lost,"" he says, adding, ""you can't imagine the smell."" Minnesota-based InstyMeds Corp. dispenses prescription medicines from its machines, often placed in clinics. The machines are electronically linked to a doctor's computer system, and validate each patient's identity and the prescription using a unique code that the doctor assigns to the patient. InstyMeds -- which has to deal with a patchwork of state laws, such as drug-labeling and machine placement requirements -- has 200 machines in 24 states and has dispensed 1.5 million prescriptions since the machines began operating in 2007. Kevin Satre, of Mankato, Minn., used an InstyMeds machine after his eye swelled up during a weekend away playing golf in Brainerd, Minn. He drove to the nearest medical center and was diagnosed with shingles. ""I didn't know where to go for a pharmacy,"" he recalls. The 48-year-old didn't feel comfortable right away using the machine, but says, ""I would do it again, if time was of the essence."" Machines, like Coinstar Inc.'s Redboxes, are smart enough to rent DVDs. At airports, vending machines with headphones and electronics are now common. Machines with newfangled options, such as touch screens, cashless readers and wireless connectivity run $500 to $1,000 more than a standard model, which cost thousands of dollars. Canteen Vending, based in Charlotte, N.C., has more than 100,000 machines. Some 20,000 of them have cashless devices that take credit cards and are ready to take smartphone payments. Canteen has one line of machines, known as the 2bU, which are equipped with touch screens that show product information. ""Because of our size, we can pilot and experiment and invest a little more,"" says Dennis Hogan, Canteen's chief executive. The industry's decline reflects a range of socioeconomic changes. Food and fuel costs have increased, but consumers are reluctant to insert more than a $1 bill; snacks and sodas are under assault for being unhealthy. Many young people don't bother with cash, relying instead on plastic, which only the newest machines accept. By contrast, many smaller operators say the need to upgrade can be insurmountable. For those who invested in traditional snack machines, shelling out for new equipment with credit-card readers or touch screens isn't realistic. ""That's a huge investment,"" says Elliot Maras, editor of Automatic Merchandiser, a trade magazine. About 90% of traditional vending operators have less than $5 million in revenues, according to the publication. Michael Ehrentreu, in the vending business for 26 years, tried to retrofit his old snack machines with new technology, such as credit-card readers, to make them more relevant. ""The new machines are so exciting,"" he says. ""But they are expensive."" Faced with slow sales and rising costs, he ended up merging his business, Aldar Vending, of Hackensack, N.J, with a larger player that uses the newest technology. Then there are the low-tech, high-concept Art-o-mats -- refurbished old, mechanical cigarette machines selling small pieces of artwork for $5. Art-o-mat is the brainchild of Clark Whittington of Winston-Salem, N.C., who has sold about 100 of the retro machines, now scattered around the country in museums, galleries, hotels, restaurants and shops. Colorfully customized by Mr. Whittington, the machines sell about 30,000 pieces a year and the 300 artists who supply the inventory receive $2.50 for each piece sold. Scott Blake, an Omaha-based artist known for giant portraits constructed from bar codes, says the vending machine gives artists wider exposure as well as additional revenue. ""It's easier to sell a million one-dollar things than one, $1 million thing,"" says Mr. Blake. ""I'm working my way up to $1 million, one dollar at a time."" Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Hot Spots That Don't Stay Home,"Ah, the Internet! The source of so much goodness. The font of e-mail, news, chat, TV, blogs, books and Facebook. What would we do without it? If you're like most people, you know perfectly well. Once you're out of the house and on the road, you're out of Wi-Fi range. You're either offline completely, or you peek at the Internet through the tiny screen of a smartphone. There is another way. You could get a broadband cellular hot spot, like the MiFi, a tiny, self-powered base station that creates a Wi-Fi bubble from your pocket or purse. Nearby laptops, iPads and iPod Touches can get online, wherever you happen to be. These cellular hot spots are fantastic companions on long car rides, offsite meetings, movie shoots on location, trade show booths, hotel rooms, beaches, airplanes stuck on runways and anywhere else where Wi-Fi is costly or nonexistent. Unfortunately, the hot spots from Verizon or AT&T cost at least $50 a month. As of this week, there's a new option from NetZero. It may not change the game, but it does change some of the rules. You buy the NetZero 4G HotSpot -- an attractive black plastic slab with a small gray screen -- for $100. You get wireless Internet free for the first year, and pay as little as $10 a month after that. That's an amazing number. If you do the math, it turns out that $10 a month is a lot less than $50. To make matters juicier, this is a 4G hot spot. And that means that, in big cities, you get extremely fast Internet. In my tests in Boston, New York and San Francisco, downloads come in at 5 to 10 megabits a second. It's about what you'd get at home with a basic cable modem. Now, if you recognize the name Net-Zero, you may remember the company's original service about 15 years ago: free home Internet, brought to you by onscreen ads. Unfortunately, over time, NetZero made the deal worse and worse. First it started charging fees if you were online more than 40 hours a month, then 10 hours a month. Virgin Mobile's $40 unlimited MiFi of 2010 suffered a similar fate. The point is that these plans can change at any time. That's the first worry. The second is that the NetZero hot spot may be 4G, but it's only 4G. As soon as you leave one of the areas served by its 4G network, you're offline. The Net-Zero doesn't drop down to 3G as a backup. That's a problem, because NetZero's hot spot devices and coverage are both provided by Clearwire, which has been building a nationwide 4G cellular network for a few years now. (The NetZero HotSpot is just a relabeled Clear Apollo.) Clearwire's national 4G ''footprint'' is available in only 70 cities. Don't dive in until you check the coverage maps at clear.com/coverage; you might wind up spending $100 for a machine that does absolutely nothing for you. Finally, NetZero's amazing prices include not-so-amazing amounts of Internet use. You know that first year, when you pay nothing for service? You're getting only 200 megabytes of data a month, which is about enough for daily e-mail checks and the occasional Web page. Once you start downloading apps or watching videos, it's all over. Then there's the $10 plan. That one buys you only 500 megabytes -- again, not a whopping lot if you're an active user. NetZero also offers plans for $20 (1 gigabyte), $35 (2 gigabytes) and $50 (4 gigabytes). So at the $50 level, Net-Zero's gadget is actually a worse deal than Verizon's ($50 for 5 gigabytes). That's not to say that the NetZero is worthless. It has two advantages over the Verizon/AT&T deals: First, there's no two-year contract. With a call to 1-800-NET-ZERO, you can activate or deactivate the service monthly, as you need it. For example, you might turn it on only during the summer months when you're traveling. Second, you can buy smaller, less expensive chunks of service. You're paying more per megabyte of use, but you don't have to buy as many of them. It's as though NetZero were giving you the option to buy one Q-tip at a time instead of 500-packs. Even so, NetZero is only one possibility in a world full of them. It's worth knowing your options: CLEARWIRE At Clear.com, you can buy pocket hot spots that let you pay by time, not by megabytes of data. Which, let's face it, is the world's dumbest metering system. How are you supposed to know how many megabytes will be used up by a certain Web page or e-mail session? You can pay $5 for a two-hour Internet session, $10 for a day, $25 for a week or $50 a month. If you're willing to settle for a much slower speed -- good enough for e-mail and Web but not videos -- you can pay $35 a month instead. Here again, these hot spots are 4G only, and only in Clear's 70 cities. But if you live in one of them, a Clear is a natural companion for, say, an iPad. You save $130 by buying the Wi-Fi-only iPad model, and your $50 a month covers unlimited data instead of 5 gigabytes. VERIZON The Lexus of mobile hot spot service. The MiFi is free with a two-year contract. And it's a 4G LTE hot spot, meaning service that's much faster than Clear's or NetZero's, and Verizon blankets more of the United States with LTE signal than any other carrier. The price per megabyte is pretty good, but you have to buy a lot of them: $50 a month for 5 gigs, $80 for 10 gigs. AT&T The AT&T version of the MiFi costs $70 with a two-year contract. The service starts the same as Verizon's: $50 a month for 5 gigs of data; each additional gigabyte costs $10. SPRINT You can get a MiFi free, or a bulkier Sierra Overdrive for $50, with a two-year contract. The monthly service fees are $35 (for 3 gigabytes), $50 (for 6) and $80 (for 12); all of these are better deals than Verizon or AT&T, but of course Sprint's network isn't as big. What's nice about these Sprint options is that they use 4G when available, and fall back to 3G when necessary. TETHERING If you have an app phone -- an iPhone or Android phone, for example -- you can pay your cellphone carrier an extra $20 or $30 a month to turn on tethering. That's where the phone itself acts as a hot spot, converting the cell signal to a Wi-Fi signal just the way a MiFi does, for the benefit of your laptop or tablet. That $20 buys you a couple of extra gigabytes of data each month. The great thing about tethering is that you don't have another gadget to charge and carry around; it's just your phone. The not-so-great thing is that using this feature can deplete a phone's battery charge in a couple of hours. USB STICKS A pocket hot spot lets multiple laptops or tablets get online simultaneously (eight, in NetZero's/Clear's case). But if your laptop is the only thing that you want to use online, you can buy a USB attachment, which looks like a flash drive. Any company that sells pocket hot spots also sells USB sticks; the service plans are the same. BUILT INTO LAPTOPS Some netbooks come with cellular modems built in, meaning that you have to sign up for a two-year contract with a cellular company when you buy it. That arrangement seems to be dying out, though. Ah, the Internet! The source of so much goodness -- and slowly, very slowly, more on-ramps with lower tolls.

201203,UPDATE 3-Micron posts mixed results as low chip prices weigh,"* Company says low memory chip prices continue * Quarterly revenue $2.07 bln; Wall St estimated $2.02 bln * Quarterly loss bigger than expected * Stock drops 3.2 pct after hours (Adds details from company, background) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, March 22 (Reuters) - Micron Technology posted mixed quarterly results, and investors pushed its shares lower after the company said persistently low prices for its memory chips had yet to recover. The slide into bankruptcy of Japanese DRAM chipmaker Elpida in February has created expectations that chipmakers' pricing power, diminished by oversupply, will bounce back this year. But Micron said DRAM prices had yet to rise and that prices for NAND had fallen compared with the prior quarter. In after-hours trade, its shares were down 3.2 percent at $8.43, after having closed at $8.71 on the Nasdaq. Shares of Micron, the top U.S. memory chipmaker, are up nearly 40 percent year to date. Still, recently appointed Chief Executive Mark Durcan told analysts on a conference call on Thursday that the outlook for memory chip prices was on the mend. ""Recently we're seeing improvements in the DRAM market ... I think concerns over supply seem to be having a positive or at least stabilizing effect,"" Durcan said. ""Overall, we see generally healthy supply/demand outlook for NAND moving forward."" In its first earnings report since former Chief Executive and Chairman Steve Appleton died in a small-plane crash in February, Micron said that it sold 20 percent more NAND and DRAM chips by volume in its fiscal second quarter than in the previous three months. But it said that increase was offset by lower average selling prices. Appleton was replaced by Durcan, who had been Chief Operating Officer and was long seen as an even-keeled, top technologist. The demise of Elpida has boosted Micron's stock on expectations the Japanese company's DRAM output, estimated to be about 12 percent of global production, could permanently disappear, pushing up prices in the beleaguered industry. Analysts say Micron is likely to bid for at least one of Elpida's two fabrication plants in Japan and Taiwan, which could be reconfigured to make more profitable NAND chips, widely used in tablets, smartphones and other hand-held gadgets. ""We'll be evaluating market situations as they develop and look for opportunities to strengthen Micron's competitive position,"" Durcan told analysts on the call. He said pricing, intellectual property, the competitive landscape and possible improvements in efficiency would all play into Micron's consolidation strategy. SOLID STATE Hit by a shortage of hard drives after floods damaged factories in China last year, personal computer makers had adopted solid-state drives using NAND chips in some of their models. Solid-state drives are more efficient than traditional hard drives but have yet to become ubiquitous in mainstream PCs. Micron President Mark Adams told Reuters that manufacturers have sold fewer PCs with solid-state drives than expected because prices for them remain high. Last month, Micron increased its exposure to the NAND market when it announced it would pay $600 million to buy back Intel Corp's stake in two wafer factories the companies ran as a joint venture. Micron said revenue in its fiscal second quarter, ended March 1, was $2.07 billion, compared with $2.26 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average expected $2.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Micron said gross margin fell to 13 percent from 15 percent in the prior quarter due to pressure on its NOR flash sales in the wireless market. Micron reported a net loss of $224 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter, versus a net profit of $72 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Analysts expected a loss of 19 cents.

201203,INTERVIEW-Samsung sees smartphones leading Africa growth,"CAPE TOWN, March 22 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co aims to double its share of the sub-Saharan smartphone market to 20 percent by next year, as it focuses on affordable handsets, the head of its Africa business said on Thursday. The Korean maker of televisions and white goods is aggressively courting African consumers with its ""Built for Africa"" line, which features energy-saving electrical appliances purpose built to withstand high temperatures and erratic power supply. But the company sees some of its biggest opportunities on the continent from rising demand for cheaper smartphones, Kwang Kee Park, Samsung's president and chief operating officer for Africa, told Reuters in an interview. ""We intend to grow the smartphone market up to 20 percent for the next one year's time with the Galaxy Pocket,"" he said, referring to a stripped-down version of its Galaxy smartphone. Africa is the fastest growing mobile market in the world and will be home to 738 million handsets by the end of this year, according to a survey by industry body GSMA. The rise of smartphones has also given millions of African internet access for the first time. Samsung estimates the total African market for handset devices shipped was around 97 million, with smartphone penetration currently around 6 to 8 percent. Samsung's share of the smartphone market in Africa stands at about 10 percent. Samsung, which had assembly plants in South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Senegal, Mali and north Sudan, is aiming reach the $3 billion sales mark this year, up $1 billion on last year. The company has said it aims to boost its revenue from Africa to $10 billion by 2015. But Park said that would depend on Samsung being able to develop more locally relevant products at cheaper prices. ""Every year we can come up with another $1 billion in business,"" he said. ""But it really depends on how we develop more locally relevant products and make the products more affordable.""

201203,Foxconn International swings to 2011 net profit,"HONG KONG, March 22 (Reuters) - Foxconn International Holdings Ltd, the world's biggest contract manufacturer of cellphones, swung to a net profit in 2011 as key clients such as Nokia Oyj and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd shifted to higher-end smartphones. Foxconn International, whose Taiwanese parent Foxconn Technology Group assembles Apple Inc's iPads and iPhones, is expected to benefit as its top customers shift away from low-end feature phones. The company, which assembles handsets for Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc and Sony Corp, on Thursday posted a net profit of $72.84 million, ahead of the consensus of analysts' forecasts of $27.59 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""Our efforts in capacity optimisation in various geographical locations and new customer penetration started to create positive impact to our operation results,"" it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Foxconn International had a total of 98,868 employees at the end of 2011, down about 22 percent from 126,687 a year ago. In 2010, Foxconn International posted a net loss of $218.3 million as some of its clients in the competitive mobile handset sector lost market share. ""We expect the transition from 2G feature phones to 3G smartphones for Foxconn International's top clients (Nokia, Huawei, Motorola and Sony) to boost its average selling price,"" said Barclays Capital analyst Dale Gai in a report before the earnings release. Nokia is betting on its Lumia Windows phones, while Huawei is shifting towards producing higher-end phones based on Google Inc's Android operating system to compete with major players such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd . Barclays estimated Nokia would account for 30-35 percent of Foxconn International's sales in 2012/13. ""We expect Huawei - FIH's 2nd largest customer and a rising star in the smartphone space - to be a key growth driver for FIH in coming years,"" said Macquarie analyst Kylie Huang. Shares in Foxconn International, which were removed from Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index in June last year, have risen about 14 percent this year on hopes for a better product mix from its clients.

201203,UPDATE 1-NEC to buy Convergys business support ops for $450 mln,"* NEC wants to boost international operations * NEC shares rise 1.8 percent to outperform Nikkei (Adds background) TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Japan's NEC Corp said on Thursday it would spend $450 million to buy the business support operations of U.S. telecoms firm Convergys Corp as it hunts for new telecom equipment sales abroad. NEC, which is slashing jobs as it heads for a net loss, has been struggling with sluggish sales at home and has been hungry for client access abroad to expand sales of its telecom equipment, data centres and other network infrastructure. Convergys, which competes with Amdocs and Comverse Technology, had been viewed as an acquisition target after the company mentioned the possible sale of itself or of certain assets in a strategic review conducted in the summer of 2010. The support operations include billing and client support services. Last year, AT&T Inc bought Convergys' interests in two wireless operations in the Cincinnati, Ohio area of the United States for about $320 million in cash. NEC expects to complete the deal by the end of June and will absorb the customer care and billing provider for companies in the United States and Europe into its subsidiary, NetCracker Technology Corp. UBS Investment Bank was the financial advisor for NEC on the deal. NEC plans to post a net loss of 100 billion yen ($1.20 billion) for the year to March 31, due poor performance in its smartphones in a market dominated by Apple's iPhone. Inroads being made by foreign rivals into the domestic IT infrastructure business and difficulty in expanding overseas is also hurting the company. Shares in NEC rose 1.8 percent on Thursday, outperforming an 0.4 percent gain in the benchmark Nikkei 225. The deal was first reported by the Nikkei business daily just ahead of the close of the day's trading.

201203,Upgrade for the Masses? --- India's Micromax Expands From Low-Price Handsets to Smartphones,"GURGAON, India -- Rahul Sharma, co-founder of Micromax Informatics Ltd., was in a New Delhi airport lounge recently, reading his email on a new phone his company designed. Every few seconds, he waved his hand above the handset. A fellow traveler asked him what he was doing. ""Gesture control,"" Mr. Sharma says he responded, ""so you no longer have to touch the screen."" The Micromax A85 Superfone he was using is part of a drive to duplicate in the fast-growing smartphone market the success the Indian handset manufacturer has had undercutting and outmaneuvering the giants of India's more traditional cellphone industry. The A85 is priced at $400, an important marker for a company mostly has been known for selling cellphones for less than $100, occasionally for less than $50. ""Sometimes, you have to prove a point that you are capable of making world-class products,"" Mr. Sharma, 37 years old, says in an interview. The A85, which runs on Google Inc.'s Android operating system, has a front-facing camera that captures hand gestures. Software then translates that gesture to, for example, scroll through emails, songs or pictures. Micromax is trying to combine that high-end technological savvy with its recipe of driving down prices, hoping to sell a smartphone to the masses. The company currently offers five smartphones, the least expensive starting at $80. Smartphones from Nokia Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. start at around $160 while BlackBerry's entry-level model starts costs around $200. With an initial investment of $20 million, Micromax plans to introduce four more smartphones every quarter and for the category to account for one-quarter of the company's revenue for the fiscal year through next March. The company is aiming for a 10% share of the Indian smartphone market by the end of 2012. It had just a trace share of India's smartphone market, behind Samsung, Nokia and Research In Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry in September, according to research and consulting firm CyberMedia Research Ltd. Analysts warn that a low price is no guarantee of success. As a new player, Micromax will have to woo customers from its better known rivals. ""We will be the most serious competition that these companies have seen,"" Mr. Sharma responds. RIM says that with only 12 million smartphone users in India, a country of 1.2 billion people, the potential for the market to grow is huge. ""As more players come in, it will, by default, increase the pie of the smartphone market,"" a spokesman says. Nokia and Samsung decline to comment. India is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing phone markets. Last year, roughly 213 million phones were sold in the country, compared with 185 million in the U.S. and 444 million in China. India's sales of smartphones are growing about 44% a year as lower prices make them affordable to more people. ""Smartphones is where the market is going to move in the coming years,"" says Anshul Gupta, a consultant at research firm Gartner. Analysts caution that Micromax's smartphone foray could distract the company from its bedrock market of inexpensive phones. In the three years since it began making inexpensive phones, Micromax's sales have been swift. Revenue rose more than fourfold in fiscal 2010 to $320 million and reached $466 million in fiscal 2011. The company now is India's No. 3 seller of cellphones, behind Nokia and Samsung. But Micromax's market share by volume has eroded as new companies entered the low-end market, to 5% at the end of November from 7.6% at the end of 2010, according to CyberMedia. Profit slipped to $39 million for fiscal 2011 from $40 million a year earlier. ""Between 2008 and 2010 Micromax was the most sought-after company,"" says Prashant Singhal, head of Ernst & Young's India telecommunications practice. ""It was the leader in the local handset market. It's lost that spot now."" Competition at the high end will be fierce as well. ""The trade-off is with brand perception,"" says Mr. Gupta. ""People will need a compensation factor to go for it."" Mr. Sharma says he is confident the company can succeed in the low end and in smartphones. ""We changed the rules of the game in feature phones and we are all set to do that in smartphones,"" he says.""Our minds are always working on, 'Why will a consumer buy a Micromax phone?' And that's how we start building a product."" Mr. Sharma joined Micromax in 1998, when it was run by a childhood neighbor and built e-commerce websites. In 2003, the company developed an attachment that could connect an old-fashioned phone where landlines didn't reach. In 2007 Mr. Sharma was traveling in rural India where there was no electricity and saw people charging their cellphones with a truck battery. Micromax developed a phone with a 30-day battery life and sold out its first run of 10,000 phones in 10 days. ""We hadn't done any marketing; it was only word-of-mouth,"" recalls Mr. Sharma. From then on, the company has manufactured a wide range of phones targeted at specific audiences, leaving out features according to each narrow market. Its Bling line is embedded with Swarovski zircons but has no GPS, which Micromax assumed wasn't a priority for the fashion-conscious audience. For teenagers, Micromax offers a candy-bar-size phone that has a full keypad for sending text messages but doesn't have the third-generation chip for Web browsing that is standard on many other phones. Micromax says parents won't foot a 3G phone's higher monthly bill. Micromax also is expanding outside India. It entered Nepal in 2010 and has since moved to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Arabian Peninsula and Brazil. Nigeria is next. The company had planned for an initial public offering last year but shelved the idea in a weak Indian stock market. ""We are already prepared for an IPO,"" Mr. Sharma says. ""The moment the market comes back with its normal swing, we'll be there."" License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc. Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says sales to consumers dropped 23 percent from a year earlier. HP is the world's largest maker of PCs, but it's been performing badly as buyers in the industrialized world are turning their attention to Apple's iPads and Macs. Meanwhile, it hasn't been able to capture the growing appetite for PCs in emerging markets. Revenue from commercial businesses fell 4 percent. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. says it closed four times the number of seven-figure deals in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In the current quarter, the company got its first nine-figure deal ever. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. says its profit sank 64 percent in its fourth quarter and gives a lackluster sales outlook. The company expects hard disk memory sales to bounce back as much as 20 percent, but anticipates wireless segment sales to decline sequentially in the current quarter due to seasonal factors. It also expects networking sales to be flat. Feb. 29: Microsoft begins letting consumers try out its upcoming touch-based Windows 8 operating system. It aims to power a new wave of tablet computers and traditional PCs designed to counter Apple's big gains in the market through its Macs and iPads.

Research firm Gartner forecasts that PC shipments will grow 4.4 percent worldwide this year after a small drop in 2011. That's relatively weak growth as consumer attention turns to tablets. Tuesday: Oracle Corp. says sales of new software licenses picked up in its latest quarter, helping to ease concerns about the company's future as it loses customers to rivals offering less expensive alternatives. Total revenue grew just 3 percent in the December-February period. But revenue from new software licenses went up 7 percent, helping to offset defections to companies that specialize in Internet-based software known as cloud computing.

201203,"Hewlett-Packard combining its printing and PC units in effort to cut costs, turn itself around","NEW YORK (AP) - Hewlett-Packard Co. is combining its printer and PC divisions as it tries to overcome dragging profits, growing competition and the lack of clear identity. The move announced Wednesday will help the company streamline its business and save money to invest in growing areas. HP, a Silicon Valley pioneer, is hoping a renewed focus on innovation will re-establish the 73-year-old company as a technology trailblazer ""We have got to place a few bets where we can fundamentally change the name of the game,"" HP CEO Meg Whitman told shareholders Wednesday at the company's annual meeting in Santa Clara, Calif. The Associated Press monitored a webcast of the meeting. Whitman said printing remains one of the areas where HP can still make its mark. First, though, she said the company needs to trim its expenses, describing the combination of the PC and printing division as a ""perfect example"" of her streamlining plans. ""We are going to have to save to get growth going again at HP,"" Whitman told shareholders. Wednesday's restructuring is one of the first major steps that Whitman, formerly eBay Inc.'s chief, has taken since she took the top job at HP in September. Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, had wanted to sell or spin off the PC business, a plan that contributed to his ouster after 11 months on the job. Under Whitman, HP decided to keep the unit after all. The change comes as sales of printers and ink, once HP's lifeblood, are falling because people are sharing more documents and photos online instead of printing them. HP, the world's No. 1 maker of personal computers, is also coping with declining PC sales as consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe delay replacing their machines and spend money instead on smartphones and tablet computers such as Apple's iPad. Whitman inherited a faltering company that's facing growing competition from mobile devices and internal operational challenges such as a complex supply chain, which HP hopes to simplify by combining the divisions. While HP's revenue has been falling, the company's expenses have been rising -- an imbalance that Whitman is scrambling to fix. Echoing remarks that she made to analysts last month, Whitman told shareholders Wednesday that it may take several years to clean up the mess. Investors already have been growing impatient as HP has been eclipsed by neighboring tech companies such as Apple Inc., whose founder, Steve Jobs, briefly worked at HP in the 1970s One investor who addressed Whitman expressed his frustration over the divergent fortunes of Apple and HP. Apple's market value has soared by more than $500 billion during the past decade while HP's has climbed by about $10 billion. Besides combining the PC and printing units, Whitman is unifying HPs marketing functions under one executive and consolidating other areas of its business. She told shareholders that the company can reduce its roughly $4 billion marketing budget without hurting the HP brand. Whitman hopes to reduce the internal complexity that she believes is making the company slow to adapt to customer demands and changing technology. On Wednesday, the company stressed that the changes will mean a more streamlined, faster and consumer-focused Hewlett-Packard, one that fits its mantra, ""One HP."" The company expects to increase productivity and efficiency in PCs and printing, while streamlining customer support and the company's supply chain. Shaw Wu, senior technology analyst at Sterne Agee, said he believes there's room to cut expenses, particularly in administration and marketing. But he warned that savings may be limited. Customers don't necessarily want to buy computers and printers at the same time. People replace PCs much quicker than printers, which can last five years or longer. HP didn't say how much it will save or what effect the restructuring would have on jobs, but the move is likely to result in layoffs. In a 2009 shake-up of the printing, PC and other divisions, HP cut 4,400 jobs. The company had 349,600 workers as of October, the end of its most recent fiscal year. Whitman will have plenty of choices as she decides where to invest the company's savings, said Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said. For one, HP has been investing in thinner, lighter laptop computers known as ultrabooks -- devices that are easy to hold like tablets yet more powerful in sporting regular keyboards and the ability to run programs side by side on the same screen. Gillett also believes there's room for innovation in printing as the way people use printers evolves. He said it'll help to have PC and printer product designers working together. Though the market might be shrinking, he said, ""it's hard to imagine in the next 10 years that we are going to get rid of large, cheap, disposable displays -- i.e. paper."" The combined PC and printing unit will be led by Todd Bradley, 53, the executive vice president of the PC group since 2005. Vyomesh Joshi, the head of the printing group, is retiring after 31 years with HP, with a severance package of about $10.8 million, according to the company's regulatory filings. Joshi also is eligible for retirement benefits valued at nearly $7 million as of Oct. 31. HP said the restructuring will help improve its branding, a challenge for a massive and storied technology company with a role in everything from computers to consulting. Unlike, say, Apple or IBM Corp., HP lacks an identity that people can associate with it, Wu said. Ultimately, HP will have to define the ""big picture"" of what the company stands for, Wu said. ""What is HP?"" Whitman offered this definition at Wednesday's annual meeting: ""HP is the world's largest provider of information technology infrastructure, software, services and solutions to individuals and corporations of all sizes. It's simple, it's clear and it doesn't need a lot of explanation."" Toward the end of the meeting, Whitman discovered she had gotten a part of HP's identity wrong. In her prepared remarks, Whitman said the company would be celebrating its 70th anniversary in 2014. A shareholder corrected her during the question-and-answer session, reminding her that HP started in a Palo Alto, Calif. garage in 1939, which would make the company 75-years-old in 2014. HP, which is still based in Palo Alto, had briefly combined the PC and printing business businesses before, under the leadership of Carly Fiorina. Mark Hurd reversed that when he took over as CEO in 2005, when the printer division was still thriving. The printing and PC units together made up about half of HP's $30 billion revenue in the November-January quarter. HP's stock fell 52 cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $23.46 on Wednesday. ---- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman and AP Technology Writers Michael Liedtke and Peter Svensson contributed to this story.

201203,Restocking the Old Vending Machine With Live Bait and Prescription Pills,"Long a cultural icon, the vending machine is fading from the American landscape. The numbers are bleak: Traditional vending machines disappeared from 134,000 locations between 2007 and 2010, according to the latest available data from Vending Times, an industry publication. Sales from vending machines sank more than 11%, to $42.2 billion in the same period. Amid the changes, a new group of entrepreneurs is trying to build a new vending industry, outfitting machines with high-tech features, and filling them with live bait, prescription drugs, electronics and even art. Machines selling quirky products likely account for less than 5% of all vending machines, but that hasn't stopped the entrepreneurs from trying. Norman VanConia of Morgantown, Pa., was more than a little skeptical the first time he saw a live-bait vending machine, in 2009, installed at a gas station not far from home. The night crawlers—$3.50 a dozen, $6 for 24—were on the second row, above the minnows and below the mealworms. But the juicy critters ""were in good condition and I have used them ever since,"" says Mr. VanConia, noting that the machine saves him a 20-mile trip to the bait shop. His response is typical, says Gary Harsel, who started PA Live Bait Vending in Elverson, Pa., as a supplement to his tackle shop. ""The first year I put the machines out, [customers] couldn't grasp the concept,"" says Mr. Harsel. He sold the company to Big Rock Sports LLC last summer and today more than 400 live-bait machines are operating. Matt Kurtz, who services 28 live-bait machines in the vicinity, regularly rotates the containers, allowing the worms to burrow down, and replaces the water for the minnows. He worries mostly about power outages, which disrupt the refrigeration. When that happens, ""bait leaks through the cups and you will lose a month to two months of work to regain what you lost,"" he says, adding, ""you can't imagine the smell."" Minnesota-based InstyMeds Corp. dispenses prescription medicines from its machines, often placed in clinics. The machines are electronically linked to a doctor's computer system, and validate each patient's identity and the prescription using a unique code that the doctor assigns to the patient. InstyMeds—which has to deal with a patchwork of state laws, such as drug-labeling and machine placement requirements—has 200 machines in 24 states and has dispensed 1.5 million prescriptions since the machines began operating in 2007. Kevin Satre, of Mankato, Minn., used an InstyMeds machine after his eye swelled up during a weekend away playing golf in Brainerd, Minn. He drove to the nearest medical center and was diagnosed with shingles. ""I didn't know where to go for a pharmacy,"" he recalls. The 48-year-old didn't feel comfortable right away using the machine, but says, ""I would do it again, if time was of the essence."" Last month, controversy erupted at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania, where a machine dispensed contraceptive morning-after pills. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration contacted the school, concerned that minors would be able to easily get the pills. After demonstrating sufficient restricted access, the school was permitted to continue selling the pills through the machine. Machines, like Coinstar Inc.'s Redboxes, are smart enough to rent DVDs. At airports, vending machines with headphones and electronics are now common. Machines with newfangled options, such as touch screens, cashless readers and wireless connectivity run $500 to $1,000 more than a standard model, which cost thousands of dollars. Canteen Vending, based in Charlotte, N.C., has more than 100,000 machines. Some 20,000 of them have cashless devices that take credit cards and are ready to take smartphone payments. Canteen has one line of machines, known as the 2bU, which are equipped with touch screens that show product information. ""Because of our size, we can pilot and experiment and invest a little more,"" says Dennis Hogan, Canteen's chief executive. The industry's decline reflects a range of socioeconomic changes. Food and fuel costs have increased, but consumers are reluctant to insert more than a $1 bill; snacks and sodas are under assault for being unhealthy, and in the recession, factories and offices downsized, leaving employee break rooms with less traffic. Many young people don't bother with cash, relying instead on plastic, which only the newest machines accept. By contrast, many smaller operators say the need to upgrade can be insurmountable. For those who invested in traditional snack machines, shelling out for new equipment with credit-card readers or touch screens isn't realistic. ""That's a huge investment,"" says Elliot Maras, editor of Automatic Merchandiser, a trade magazine. About 90% of traditional vending operators have less than $5 million in revenues, according to the publication. Michael Ehrentreu, in the vending business for 26 years, tried to retrofit his old snack machines with new technology, such as credit-card readers, to make them more relevant. ""The new machines are so exciting,"" he says. ""But they are expensive."" Faced with slow sales and rising costs, he ended up merging his business, Aldar Vending, of Hackensack, N.J, with a larger player that uses the newest technology. Then there are the low-tech, high-concept Art-o-mats—refurbished old, mechanical cigarette machines selling small pieces of artwork for $5. Art-o-mat is the brainchild of Clark Whittington of Winston-Salem, N.C., who has sold about 100 of the retro machines, now scattered around the country in museums, galleries, hotels, restaurants and shops. Colorfully customized by Mr. Whittington, the machines sell about 30,000 pieces a year and the 300 artists who supply the inventory receive $2.50 for each piece sold. Scott Blake, an Omaha-based artist known for giant portraits constructed from bar codes, says the vending machine gives artists wider exposure as well as additional revenue. ""It's easier to sell a million one-dollar things than one, $1 million thing,"" says Mr. Blake. ""I'm working my way up to $1 million, one dollar at a time.""

201203,Hot Spots That Don’t Stay Home,"Ah, the Internet! The source of so much goodness. The font of e-mail, news, chat, TV, blogs, books and Facebook. What would we do without it? If you’re like most people, you know perfectly well. Once you’re out of the house and on the road, you’re out of Wi-Fi range. You’re either offline completely, or you peek at the Internet through the tiny screen of a smartphone. There is another way. You could get a broadband cellular hot spot, like the MiFi, a tiny, self-powered base station that creates a Wi-Fi bubble from your pocket or purse. Nearby laptops, iPads and iPod Touches can get online, wherever you happen to be. These cellular hot spots are fantastic companions on long car rides, offsite meetings, movie shoots on location, trade show booths, hotel rooms, beaches, airplanes stuck on runways and anywhere else where Wi-Fi is costly or nonexistent. Unfortunately, the hot spots from Verizon or AT&T cost at least $50 a month. As of this week, there’s a new option from NetZero. It may not change the game, but it does change some of the rules. You buy the NetZero 4G HotSpot — an attractive black plastic slab with a small gray screen — for $100. You get wireless Internet free for the first year, and pay as little as $10 a month after that. That’s an amazing number. If you do the math, it turns out that $10 a month is a lot less than $50. To make matters juicier, this is a 4G hot spot. And that means that, in big cities, you get extremely fast Internet. In my tests in Boston, New York and San Francisco, downloads come in at 5 to 10 megabits a second. It’s about what you’d get at home with a basic cable modem. Now, if you recognize the name Net-Zero, you may remember the company’s original service about 15 years ago: free home Internet, brought to you by onscreen ads. Unfortunately, over time, NetZero made the deal worse and worse. First it started charging fees if you were online more than 40 hours a month, then 10 hours a month. Virgin Mobile’s $40 unlimited MiFi of 2010 suffered a similar fate. The point is that these plans can change at any time. That’s the first worry. The second is that the NetZero hot spot may be 4G, but it’s only 4G. As soon as you leave one of the areas served by its 4G network, you’re offline. The Net-Zero doesn’t drop down to 3G as a backup. That’s a problem, because NetZero’s hot spot devices and coverage are both provided by Clearwire, which has been building a nationwide 4G cellular network for a few years now. (The NetZero HotSpot is just a relabeled Clear Apollo.) Clearwire’s national 4G “footprint” is available in only 70 cities. Don’t dive in until you check the coverage maps at clear.com/coverage; you might wind up spending $100 for a machine that does absolutely nothing for you. Finally, NetZero’s amazing prices include not-so-amazing amounts of Internet use. You know that first year, when you pay nothing for service? You’re getting only 200 megabytes of data a month, which is about enough for daily e-mail checks and the occasional Web page. Once you start downloading apps or watching videos, it’s all over. Then there’s the $10 plan. That one buys you only 500 megabytes — again, not a whopping lot if you’re an active user. NetZero also offers plans for $20 (1 gigabyte), $35 (2 gigabytes) and $50 (4 gigabytes). So at the $50 level, Net-Zero’s gadget is actually a worse deal than Verizon’s ($50 for 5 gigabytes). That’s not to say that the NetZero is worthless. It has two advantages over the Verizon/AT&T deals: First, there’s no two-year contract. With a call to 1-800-NET-ZERO, you can activate or deactivate the service monthly, as you need it. For example, you might turn it on only during the summer months when you’re traveling. Second, you can buy smaller, less expensive chunks of service. You’re paying more per megabyte of use, but you don’t have to buy as many of them. It’s as though NetZero were giving you the option to buy one Q-tip at a time instead of 500-packs. Even so, NetZero is only one possibility in a world full of them. It’s worth knowing your options: CLEARWIRE At Clear.com, you can buy pocket hot spots that let you pay by time, not by megabytes of data. Which, let’s face it, is the world’s dumbest metering system. How are you supposed to know how many megabytes will be used up by a certain Web page or e-mail session? You can pay $5 for a two-hour Internet session, $10 for a day, $25 for a week or $50 a month. If you’re willing to settle for a much slower speed — good enough for e-mail and Web but not videos — you can pay $35 a month instead. Here again, these hot spots are 4G only, and only in Clear’s 70 cities. But if you live in one of them, a Clear is a natural companion for, say, an iPad. You save $130 by buying the Wi-Fi-only iPad model, and your $50 a month covers unlimited data instead of 5 gigabytes. VERIZON The Lexus of mobile hot spot service. The MiFi is free with a two-year contract. And it’s a 4G LTE hot spot, meaning service that’s much faster than Clear’s or NetZero’s, and Verizon blankets more of the United States with LTE signal than any other carrier. The price per megabyte is pretty good, but you have to buy a lot of them: $50 a month for 5 gigs, $80 for 10 gigs. AT&T The AT&T version of the MiFi costs $70 with a two-year contract. The service starts the same as Verizon’s: $50 a month for 5 gigs of data; each additional gigabyte costs $10. SPRINT You can get a MiFi free, or a bulkier Sierra Overdrive for $50, with a two-year contract. The monthly service fees are $35 (for 3 gigabytes), $50 (for 6) and $80 (for 12); all of these are better deals than Verizon or AT&T, but of course Sprint’s network isn’t as big. What’s nice about these Sprint options is that they use 4G when available, and fall back to 3G when necessary. TETHERING If you have an app phone — an iPhone or Android phone, for example — you can pay your cellphone carrier an extra $20 or $30 a month to turn on tethering. That’s where the phone itself acts as a hot spot, converting the cell signal to a Wi-Fi signal just the way a MiFi does, for the benefit of your laptop or tablet. That $20 buys you a couple of extra gigabytes of data each month. The great thing about tethering is that you don’t have another gadget to charge and carry around; it’s just your phone. The not-so-great thing is that using this feature can deplete a phone’s battery charge in a couple of hours. USB STICKS A pocket hot spot lets multiple laptops or tablets get online simultaneously (eight, in NetZero’s/Clear’s case). But if your laptop is the only thing that you want to use online, you can buy a USB attachment, which looks like a flash drive. Any company that sells pocket hot spots also sells USB sticks; the service plans are the same. BUILT INTO LAPTOPS Some netbooks come with cellular modems built in, meaning that you have to sign up for a two-year contract with a cellular company when you buy it. That arrangement seems to be dying out, though. Ah, the Internet! The source of so much goodness — and slowly, very slowly, more on-ramps with lower tolls.

201203,"A $400 Phone for the Masses? --- India's Micromax, Known for Low-Price Handsets, Pushes Into Smartphone Arena","GURGAON, India -- Rahul Sharma, co-founder of Micromax Informatics Ltd., was in a New Delhi airport lounge recently, reading his email on a new phone his company designed. Every few seconds, he waved his hand above the handset. A fellow traveler asked him what he was doing. ""Gesture control,"" Mr. Sharma says he responded, ""so you no longer have to touch the screen."" The Micromax A85 Superfone he was using is part of a drive to duplicate in the fast-growing smartphone market the success the Indian handset manufacturer has had undercutting and outmaneuvering the giants of India's cellphone industry. The A85 is priced at $400, an important marker for a company mostly known for selling cellphones for less than $100, occasionally for less than $50. ""Sometimes, you have to prove a point that you are capable of making world-class products,"" Mr. Sharma, 37 years old, says in an interview. The A85, which runs on Google Inc.'s Android operating system, has a front-facing camera that captures hand gestures. Software then translates that gesture to, for example, scroll through emails, songs or pictures. Micromax is trying to combine that high-end technological savvy with its recipe of driving down prices. The company currently offers five smartphones, the least expensive starting at $80. Smartphones from Nokia Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. start at around $160 while BlackBerry's entry-level model starts costs around $200. With an initial investment of $20 million, Micromax plans to introduce four more smartphones every quarter. The company is aiming for a 10% share of the Indian smartphone market by the end of 2012. It had just a trace share of India's smartphone market, behind Samsung, Nokia and Research In Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry in September, according to research firm CyberMedia Research Ltd. Analysts warn that a low price is no guarantee of success. As a new player, Micromax will have to woo customers from its better known rivals. RIM says that with only 12 million smartphone users in India, a country of 1.2 billion people, the potential for the market to grow is huge. ""As more players come in, it will, by default, increase the pie of the smartphone market,"" a spokesman says. Nokia and Samsung decline to comment. India is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing phone markets. Last year, roughly 213 million phones were sold in the country, compared with 185 million in the U.S. and 444 million in China. India's sales of smartphones are growing about 44% a year. In the three years since it began making inexpensive phones, Micromax's sales have been swift. Revenue rose more than fourfold in fiscal 2010 to $320 million and reached $466 million in fiscal 2011. But Micromax's market share by volume has eroded as new companies entered the low-end market, to 5% at the end of November from 7.6% at the end of 2010, according to CyberMedia. ""Between 2008 and 2010 Micromax was the most sought-after company,"" says Prashant Singhal, head of Ernst & Young's India telecommunications practice. ""It was the leader in the local handset market. It's lost that spot now."" Mr. Sharma says he is confident the company can succeed in the low end and in smartphones. ""We changed the rules of the game in feature phones and we are all set to do that in smartphones,"" he says. In 2007 Mr. Sharma was traveling in rural India where there was no electricity and saw people charging their cellphones with a truck battery. Micromax developed a phone with a 30-day battery life and sold out its first run of 10,000 phones in 10 days. ""We hadn't done any marketing; it was only word-of-mouth,"" recalls Mr. Sharma. From then on, the company has manufactured a wide range of phones targeted at specific audiences, leaving out features according to each narrow market. For teenagers, Micromax offers a candy-bar-size phone that has a full keypad for sending text messages but doesn't have the third-generation chip for Web browsing that is standard on many other phones. Micromax says parents won't foot a 3G phone's higher monthly bill. Micromax also is expanding outside India. It entered Nepal in 2010 and has since moved to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Arabian Peninsula and Brazil. Nigeria is next.  Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,Digits / Insights From WSJ.com,"Eventbrite Follows PayPal With Card Reader Online ticket start-up Eventbrite Inc. is following eBay Inc.'s PayPal with the introduction of its own credit-card reader. San Francisco-based Eventbrite, which enables people to plan and sell tickets online to events, on Wednesday will launch a card reader that can plug into an iPhone or iPad. The device allows people to accept payment for tickets at the door of an event, a market that Eventbrite so far has had little access to. The card reader, dubbed At The Door, costs $10 but that amount will be reimbursed in the user's Eventbrite account. Kevin Hartz, Eventbrite's CEO, said the device and its software create a ""mobile box office."" He adds that the company plans to promote the device with current customers but also use it to pull in new customers. Last week PayPal came out with a triangular credit-card reader that small merchants can use on smartphones. PayPal's device will compete with a square-shaped card reader from San Francisco start-up Square Inc. Mr. Hartz said Eventbrite's new reader won't compete with PayPal and Square because it is aimed at capturing ticket sales, whereas PayPal and Square's devices are aimed at mobile payments more broadly. He said Eventbrite's device will eventually work with PayPal and Square's back-end payments systems. Eventbrite, which takes a cut of any ticket sale, has been growing quickly. Founded by Mr. Hartz and his wife Julia and others, the company sold nearly 21 million tickets for some 458,207 events last year. Eventbrite has raised more than $80 million in funding from investors including Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management. Mr. Hartz said the company still has around $60 million in the bank. The company is unprofitable but revenue doubled last year, Mr. Hartz said, and it has about 200 employees. -- Pui-Wing Tam Amazon Shares Rally; Kiva Purchase Praised Shares of Amazon.com Inc. rose nearly 4% in Tuesday trading even as the Nasdaq Composite Index inched lower, as analysts suggested the Internet retail giant's purchase of Kiva Systems Inc. will help Amazon cut costs. Amazon announced Monday it is buying Kiva Systems, which develops robot technology to perform warehouse tasks, for $775 million. The move suggests that Amazon, which has relied heavily on human labor and regularly taps thousands of temporary workers for its shipping centers over the holiday shopping season, may be seeking to automate more of its expanding operations.

201203,"Apple Pads Investor Wallets; In Major Shift, New CEO Announces Dividend, Share Buyback","Tim Cook is proving he's not simply the caretaker of Apple Inc. and the unyielding strategies set forth by his predecessor, Steve Jobs. Apple on Monday bowed to mounting pressure to return some of its roughly $100 billion in cash reserves to shareholders by saying it would issue a dividend and buy back stock, marking the technology company's biggest break yet from Mr. Jobs's philosophy. The last time Apple paid a dividend was in December 1995, a year before Mr. Jobs returned to Apple. Mr. Jobs largely resisted returning cash to shareholders, whose clamoring for a cut of Apple's growing cash stockpile increased in recent years, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Jobs had long argued that Apple's cash—which at $97.6 billion as of Dec. 31 is the greatest of any nonfinancial U.S. corporation—should be used to invest in areas such as Apple's supply chain, retail stores, research and the rare acquisition. He spent little time with shareholders and rarely discussed it at all. Mr. Jobs was persuaded to do a buyback in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as the stock market fell, according to a person familiar with the matter. After that, several executives thought the company should continue to do buybacks because the stock price seemed very cheap, this person said. Apple hired bankers to study the impact of a buyback, according to this person, who said Mr. Jobs rejected the idea before it went anywhere. He felt the company could use the money to expand the business by more than the bump to per-share earnings a buyback would provide, this person said. But following Mr. Cook's appointment as CEO last August and the death of Mr. Jobs in October, Apple's approach changed. At a company event honoring Mr. Jobs last Oct. 19, Mr. Cook recounted a conversation in which the co-founder told him to run Apple as he saw fit. ""Just do what's right,"" Mr. Cook said he was told. Mr. Cook grew more forthcoming publicly on the cash topic. In a rare appearance at an investor conference in February, Mr. Cook acknowledged that the Apple board was actively discussing what to do with the cash, since the company had more than it needed to run its business. That led to Monday's conference call, in which the Cupertino, Calif., company announced it would pay a $2.65 a share quarterly dividend in its quarter beginning in July. That represents a 1.8% yield based on Apple's closing stock price before the news, roughly in line with the yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 index and in the middle of the pack of what some other dividend-issuing tech companies pay. Apple's board also authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program to begin in the quarter starting Sept. 30, largely to offset dilution from issuing new restricted-stock units to employees. Apple said the dividend and buyback programs would cost the company $45 billion in the first three years and that it would continue to evaluate it. ""Even with these investments, we can maintain a war chest for strategic opportunities and have plenty of cash to run our business,"" Mr. Cook said Monday. ""We have thought very deeply and very carefully about our cash balance."" The package marked the most significant move to date by Mr. Cook in putting his own imprint on Apple and reflects how he has been more forthcoming with shareholders, investors say. While Mr. Jobs flouted usual business practices and outside influence, Mr. Cook's shift on cash removes Apple as one of the few dividend holdouts among large technology companies. Over the past decade, other tech behemoths such as Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. had also begun payouts to shareholders as the companies matured. But unlike those companies—which were experiencing slower growth rates and whose initiation of a dividend was regarded as a sign that some of their fastest growth was behind them—Apple is still expanding rapidly. In its last reported quarter, Apple more than doubled its profits and increased revenue 73%, largely on the strength of sales of its hit iPad and iPhone devices. Some investors and analysts have said in interviews they wonder how long Apple's growth streak can last, particularly once the company has saturated some of its current growth engines, like smartphones. But Mr. Cook stressed Apple remains in a growth phase on Monday's call, saying ""we don't see ceilings to our opportunities."" Apple's cash shift is unlikely to have major ripple effects on Wall Street, however. Trading volumes for Apple's stock could increase as funds that have been shut out from holding the shares because it didn't issue a dividend now can now buy it, potentially boosting its price. Still, analysts noted the stock is already widely held and others said expectations for a dividend have been factored into the current stock price. On Monday, Apple's share price reached a new milestone, finishing the trading day above $600 for the first time. The shares rose 2.7% to $601.10, pushing Apple's market capitalization to an all-time high of $560.45 billion. Some investors said they wanted to see more cash back from Apple, given the dividend won't significantly diminish its cash stockpile. Hersh Cohen, co-manager of Legg Mason's $4 billion ClearBridge Equity Income Builder Fund, said he had hoped for a 3% yield from Apple. ""It's good they're paying a dividend, but I would say this is not a game changer,"" he said. The $45 billion the company would spend over three years represents a small percentage of Apple's expected cash flows over that time. Richard Lane, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, estimated the roughly $10 billion cost of Apple's dividend in the first year amounts to about 18% of its discretionary cash flow over that time, compared to the 20% to 25% threshold other tech companies pay. Apple will use cash it holds domestically rather than dip into its overseas holdings, where about two-thirds of its total cash sits. Apple, like many technology companies, refrains from repatriating due to the heavy tax burden of bringing that cash back to the U.S. In Monday's call, Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company has told Congress current laws provide a ""considerable economic disincentive to U.S. companies"" for repatriating it. Apple's war chest of cash illustrates a dilemma faced by many tech companies, which typically are flush with cash since they don't tie up as much money in plants, real estate, equipment and inventory as do manufacturers and retailers. Overall, the tech sector had nearly a third of the cash of all nonfinancial U.S. corporations as of December, according to Moody's. Google Inc. now is the richest nonfinancial U.S. company—with $44.63 billion in cash as of Dec. 31—without a dividend payment. Jon Kamp contributed to this article. Write to Jessica E.

201203,"Hewlett-Packard combining its printing and PC units in effort to cut costs, turn itself around","NEW YORK (AP) - Hewlett-Packard Co. is combining its printer and PC divisions as it tries to overcome dragging profits, growing competition and the absence of a focused identity. The move announced Wednesday will help the company streamline its business and save money to invest in growing areas. HP is also hoping its restructuring will boost innovation. The change comes as sales of printers and ink, once HP's lifeblood, are falling because people are sharing more documents and photos online instead of printing them. HP, the world's No. 1 maker of personal computers, is also coping with declining PC sales as consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe delay replacing their machines and spend money instead on smartphones and tablet computers such as Apple's iPad. The restructuring is one of the first major steps taken by former eBay chief Meg Whitman since she became HP's CEO in September. Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, had wanted to sell or spin off the PC business, a plan that contributed to his ouster after 11 months on the job. Under Whitman, HP decided to keep the unit after all. Whitman inherited a faltering company that's facing growing competition from mobile devices and internal operational challenges such as a complex supply chain, which HP hopes to simplify by combining the divisions. Last month, Whitman said HP plans to spend several years turning its business around. She promised a more streamlined and efficient company, and Wednesday's announcement is a step in that direction. Besides combining the PC and printing units, HP is unifying its marketing functions under one executive and consolidating other areas of its business. Whitman had said that HP has been running its business in ""silos"" for years, making the company ""too complex and too slow."" On Wednesday, the company stressed that the changes will mean a more streamlined, faster and consumer-focused Hewlett-Packard, one that fits its mantra, ""One HP."" The company expects to increase productivity and efficiency, while streamlining customer support and the company's supply chain. Shaw Wu, senior technology analyst at Sterne Agee, believes there's room to cut expenses, particularly in administration and marketing. But he warned that savings may be limited. Customers don't necessarily want to buy computers and printers at the same time. People replace PCs much quicker than printers, which can last five years or longer. HP didn't say how much it will save or what effect the restructuring would have on jobs, but the move is likely to result in layoffs. In a 2009 shake-up of the printing, PC and other divisions, HP cut 4,400 jobs. The company had 349,600 workers as of October, the end of its most recent fiscal year. The money HP saves, whether through layoffs or by other means, can be invested in growing businesses. In this, the company has a lot of choices, Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said. For one, HP has been investing in thinner, lighter laptop computers known as ultrabooks -- devices that are easy to hold like tablets yet more powerful in sporting regular keyboards and the ability to run programs side by side on the same screen. Gillett also believes there's room for innovation in printing as the way people use printers evolves. He said it'll help to have PC and printer product designers working together. Though the market might be shrinking, he said, ""it's hard to imagine in the next 10 years that we are going to get rid of large, cheap, disposable displays -- i.e. paper."" The combined PC and printing unit will be led by Todd Bradley, 53, the executive vice president of the PC group since 2005. Vyomesh Joshi, the head of the printing group, is retiring after 31 years with HP, with a severance package of about $10.8 million. HP said the restructuring will help improve its branding, a challenge for a massive and storied technology company with a role in everything from computers to consulting. Unlike, say, Apple Inc. or IBM Corp., HP lacks an identity that people can associate with it, Wu said. Ultimately, HP will have to define the ""big picture"" of what the company stands for, Wu said. ""What is HP?"" Gillett said HP is ""trying to get back to a more integrated, coherent identity as a company."" ""What I will be watching is whether they will translate that into more coherent, more integrated product innovation and consumer experience,"" he said. HP, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., had briefly combined the two businesses before, under the leadership of Carly Fiorina. Mark Hurd reversed that when he took over as CEO in 2005, when the printer division was still thriving. The printing and PC units together made up about half of HP's $30 billion revenue in the November-January quarter. Revenue from the printing division was $25.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended in October, down 13 percent from three years earlier. Meanwhile, operating profit of the printing division has dropped 13 percent to $4 billion over the same period. The PC division, while less profitable, has held up better. Revenue has dropped 6 percent from 2008, to $39.6 billion, while operating income has been flat, at $2.4 billion. HP's stock fell 52 cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $23.46 on Wednesday. ---- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman and AP Technology Writers Michael Liedtke and Peter Svensson contributed to this story.

201203,UPDATE 1-Verizon tells Congress cable deals ease spectrum crunch,"* Verizon Communications, Comcast execs appear * Verizon, Comcast say spectrum, marketing deals not contingent * Deals need OKs from U.S. regulators (Adds quotes from hearing, details on agreement) WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications and Comcast executives, in testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, defended joint spectrum and marketing deals as a way for the wireless carrier to handle a coming spectrum crunch. Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. carrier, announced plans on Dec. 2 to pay Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc $3.6 billion in spectrum and marketing deals. It reached a similar agreement with Cox Communications just days later. The cable operators would resell Verizon's mobile service as part of the deals. Opponents have focused on Verizon's already large spectrum holdings and cross-marketing agreements between Verizon and the cable companies, while some consumer advocates have said the companies should compete against each other, not collaborate. The Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department must approve the deals. The Justice Department recently blocked AT&T Inc's purchase of T-Mobile USA, a deal that AT&T said it needed to address spectrum shortages. Senator Herb Kohl, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, expressed concern that Verizon and Comcast would no longer compete as vigorously. ""The fundamental question we must answer is whether these deals will bring beneficial new choices to consumers, or amount to previously fierce rivals standing down from competition."" Lawmakers have no official role in the legal review. During the hearing, Verizon and Comcast executives said that the spectrum sale and marketing agreement, which were announced at the same time, were being reviewed by antitrust and telecommunications regulators separately. ""They are not contingent upon one another,"" added Verizon Communications General Counsel Randall Milch. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen concurred: ""I do not disagree with Mr. Milch. There is no legal connection between them."" Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, noted in his comments that under the marketing agreement, each time Verizon or Comcast sold the other's product there would be a one-time commission of ""a few hundred dollars."" In his testimony, Milch argued that his company had spent billions to better use the spectrum it had but needed more because of the explosive use of spectrum-hogging smartphones, tablets and video and audio streaming. ""We do not believe that we can engineer our way out of the spectrum crunch,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee. Data use on Verizon's network has more than doubled each of the last three years, and is expected to continue growing, according to the company. But Steven Berry, president of RCA, a trade group of smaller wireless providers, urged regulators to block the deals, saying they would have an ""insidious and disastrous effect on competition."" If not blocked, he urged the imposition of stringent conditions like spectrum divestitures and affordable roaming for smaller competitors. ""Through the spectrum transaction, related marketing deals, and joint venture between the companies, Verizon will not compete for wired services with the cable companies, and the cable companies will not compete for wireless service with Verizon,"" Berry said in written testimony. Former antitrust enforcers have said that the marketing deals would create allies out of former rivals, to the detriment of consumers. The Justice Department is known to be looking at the agreements. Comcast's Cohen defended the marketing agreements and said they should arouse no concern. ""The commercial agreements at issue here are ordinary and customary, market standard agreements. There is no merger here,"" he said. ""Not one competitor will be removed from the marketplace."" Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc. Verizon Wireless rivals, including Sprint Nextel Corp, T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications Inc, have urged regulators to block the Verizon deals. Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Mobile said the deals would result in ""an excessive concentration"" of spectrum holdings. Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. mobile providers, have said they need more spectrum to support increased consumer demand for videos and other services that soak up bandwidth. Rick Rule, an antitrust expert at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP who testified on Wednesday, predicted the spectrum deal would be approved by the Justice Department. ""A transaction that takes assets that are producing zero and is going to put the assets in hands of a company that is going to generate some output from those assets is by definition not a violation of the antitrust laws,"" he said.

But unlike those companies -- which were experiencing slower growth rates and whose initiation of a dividend was regarded as a sign that some of their fastest growth was behind them -- Apple is still expanding rapidly. In its last reported quarter, Apple more than doubled its profits and increased revenue 73%, largely on the strength of sales of its hit iPad and iPhone devices. Some investors and analysts have said in interviews they wonder how long Apple's growth streak can last, particularly once the company has saturated some of its current growth engines, like smartphones. But Mr. Cook stressed Apple remains in a growth phase on Monday's call, saying ""we don't see ceilings to our opportunities."" Apple's cash shift is unlikely to have major ripple effects on Wall Street, however. Trading volumes for Apple's stock could increase as funds that have been shut out from holding the shares because it didn't issue a dividend now can now buy it, potentially boosting its price. Still, analysts noted the stock is already widely held and others said expectations for a dividend have been factored into the current stock price. On Monday, Apple's share price reached a new milestone, finishing the trading day above $600 for the first time. The shares rose 2.7% to $601.10, pushing Apple's market capitalization to an all-time high of $560.45 billion. Some investors said they wanted to see more cash back from Apple, given the dividend won't significantly diminish its cash stockpile. Hersh Cohen, co-manager of Legg Mason's $4 billion ClearBridge Equity Income Builder Fund, said he had hoped for a 3% yield from Apple. ""It's good they're paying a dividend, but I would say this is not a game changer,"" he said. The $45 billion the company would spend over three years represents a small percentage of Apple's expected cash flows over that time. Richard Lane, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, estimated the roughly $10 billion cost of Apple's dividend in the first year amounts to about 18% of its discretionary cash flow over that time, compared to the 20% to 25% threshold other tech companies pay. Apple will use cash it holds domestically rather than dip into its overseas holdings, where about two-thirds of its total cash sits. Apple, like many technology companies, refrains from repatriating due to the heavy tax burden of bringing that cash back to the U.S. In Monday's call, Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company has told Congress current laws provide a ""considerable economic disincentive to U.S. companies"" for repatriating it. Apple's war chest of cash illustrates a dilemma faced by many tech companies, which typically are flush with cash since they don't tie up as much money in plants, real estate, equipment and inventory as do manufacturers and retailers. Overall, the tech sector had nearly a third of the cash of all nonfinancial U.S. corporations as of December, according to Moody's. Google Inc. now is the richest nonfinancial U.S. company -- with $44.63 billion in cash as of Dec. 31 -- without a dividend payment. --- Jon Kamp contributed to this article.

201203,"Corporate News: How Japan's Sharp Lost Its Edge --- 'We Haven't Had a Good Understanding of the Market,' Electronics Maker's Next President Explains","TOKYO -- Sharp Corp.'s domestic liquid-crystal-display factories once made the company a source of pride for Japan's electronics sector. Now it has taken on a less impressive mantle: Symbol of a sector struggling to compete globally. ""Severe"" is how Sharp's incoming president described the situation to reporters on Monday. Sharp expects this fiscal year to record the biggest annual loss in the company's 99-year history. The company suffered from weak demand across most of its largest product lines -- television sets, LCD screens and solar panels -- with a strong yen hurting cost-competitiveness. Underscoring the difficult conditions, the world's No. 5 maker of TV sets said last week that it will replace President Mikio Katayama with Takashi Okuda, a 34-year company veteran and the head of its overseas operations. ""Even though we possess technology to make good products, we haven't been able to launch them in a timely manner because we haven't had a good understanding of the market,"" said the 58-year-old Mr. Okuda, who will take his new post next month. He offered little detail regarding what Sharp plans to do to halt losses. On the heels of loss forecasts totaling 1.29 trillion yen ($15.46 billion) for the fiscal year that ends this month, Sharp, Panasonic Corp. and Sony Corp. announced management changes. In each case, the new executive promised to speed up operations. All three companies, the titans of Japan's consumer-electronics industry, are suffering from losses at their TV-set businesses, failing to keep pace with the innovations of Apple Inc. and unable to match the manufacturing might of Samsung Electronics Co. Sharp, the smallest of the trio, is especially vulnerable because of its aggressive investments in LCD and solar panels, where price competition has been brutal. Sharp also doesn't carry the brand cachet of Sony or Panasonic. ""What makes the situation really tough is that the very businesses Sharp bet on as its growth drivers are now the biggest drags on its earnings,"" said analyst Nobuo Kurahashi at Mizuho Investors Securities. Sharp, whose 1915 breakthrough product was the ""ever-sharp"" mechanical pencil, has seen its recent fortunes rise and fall with liquid-crystal displays, a technology that Sharp first used in calculators during the 1970s. After decades of research and development, Sharp cashed in when the TV industry shifted from bulky sets to sleek, flat-panel models in the early 2000s. With its strong LCD manufacturing legacy and state-of-the-art Japanese factories, Sharp's profit rose ninefold between 2002 and 2007. It dominated the Japanese TV-set market during those boom years, touting its domestic production as a sign of unmatched quality. Sharp continued to expand its production with increasingly ambitious LCD plants, including a $5 billion complex in western Japan in 2009. But the good times came to a halt when the domestic TV market slumped last year after a government stimulus plan ended. Meanwhile, a global slowdown meant Sharp's customers needed fewer panels. The company was saddled with an inventory glut. The solar business, another pillar of Sharp's operations, meanwhile is deep in the red. Since Sharp manufactures most of its solar panels in Japan, the strong yen has hurt its ability to export its panels at a competitive price. And solar-panel makers generally are facing tough conditions as low-cost Chinese manufacturers flood the market with supply. Demand in Japan hasn't met bullish projections and European sales have tapered off. In the fastest-growing segments of the consumer-electronics industry -- tablet computers and smartphones -- Sharp's products haven't fared much better. Sharp scaled back output of its Galapagos tablet less than a year after its debut. Sharp's smartphones fare well in Japan but have scant presence overseas. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,"A $400 Phone for the Masses? India's Micromax, Known for Low-Price Handsets, Pushes Into Smartphone Arena","GURGAON, India—Rahul Sharma, co-founder of Micromax Informatics Ltd., was in a New Delhi airport lounge recently, reading his email on a new phone his company designed. Every few seconds, he waved his hand above the handset. A fellow traveler asked him what he was doing. ""Gesture control,"" Mr. Sharma says he responded, ""so you no longer have to touch the screen."" The Micromax A85 Superfone he was using is part of a drive to duplicate in the fast-growing smartphone market the success the Indian handset manufacturer has had undercutting and outmaneuvering the giants of India's more traditional cellphone industry. The A85 is priced at $400, an important marker for a company mostly has been known for selling cellphones for less than $100, occasionally for less than $50. ""Sometimes, you have to prove a point that you are capable of making world-class products,"" Mr. Sharma, 37 years old, says in an interview. The A85, which runs on Google Inc.'s Android operating system, has a front-facing camera that captures hand gestures. Software then translates that gesture to, for example, scroll through emails, songs or pictures. Micromax is trying to combine that high-end technological savvy with its recipe of driving down prices, hoping to sell a smartphone to the masses. The company currently offers five smartphones, the least expensive starting at $80. Smartphones from Nokia Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. start at around $160 while BlackBerry's entry-level model starts costs around $200. With an initial investment of $20 million, Micromax plans to introduce four more smartphones every quarter and for the category to account for one-quarter of the company's revenue for the fiscal year through next March. The company is aiming for a 10% share of the Indian smartphone market by the end of 2012. It had just a trace share of India's smartphone market, behind Samsung, Nokia and Research In Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry in September, according to research and consulting firm CyberMedia Research Ltd. Analysts warn that a low price is no guarantee of success. As a new player, Micromax will have to woo customers from its better known rivals. ""We will be the most serious competition that these companies have seen,"" Mr. Sharma responds. RIM says that with only 12 million smartphone users in India, a country of 1.2 billion people, the potential for the market to grow is huge. ""As more players come in, it will, by default, increase the pie of the smartphone market,"" a spokesman says. Nokia and Samsung decline to comment. India is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing phone markets. Last year, roughly 213 million phones were sold in the country, compared with 185 million in the U.S. and 444 million in China. India's sales of smartphones are growing about 44% a year as lower prices make them affordable to more people. ""Smartphones is where the market is going to move in the coming years,"" says Anshul Gupta, a consultant at research firm Gartner. Analysts caution that Micromax's smartphone foray could distract the company from its bedrock market of inexpensive phones. In the three years since it began making inexpensive phones, Micromax's sales have been swift. Revenue rose more than fourfold in fiscal 2010 to $320 million and reached $466 million in fiscal 2011. The company now is India's No. 3 seller of cellphones, behind Nokia and Samsung. But Micromax's market share by volume has eroded as new companies entered the low-end market, to 5% at the end of November from 7.6% at the end of 2010, according to CyberMedia. Profit slipped to $39 million for fiscal 2011 from $40 million a year earlier. ""Between 2008 and 2010 Micromax was the most sought-after company,"" says Prashant Singhal, head of Ernst & Young's India telecommunications practice. ""It was the leader in the local handset market. It's lost that spot now."" Competition at the high end will be fierce as well. ""The trade-off is with brand perception,"" says Mr. Gupta. ""People will need a compensation factor to go for it."" Mr. Sharma says he is confident the company can succeed in the low end and in smartphones. ""We changed the rules of the game in feature phones and we are all set to do that in smartphones,"" he says.""Our minds are always working on, 'Why will a consumer buy a Micromax phone?' And that's how we start building a product."" Mr. Sharma joined Micromax in 1998, when it was run by a childhood neighbor and built e-commerce websites. In 2003, the company developed an attachment that could connect an old-fashioned phone where landlines didn't reach. In 2007 Mr. Sharma was traveling in rural India where there was no electricity and saw people charging their cellphones with a truck battery. Micromax developed a phone with a 30-day battery life and sold out its first run of 10,000 phones in 10 days. ""We hadn't done any marketing; it was only word-of-mouth,"" recalls Mr. Sharma. From then on, the company has manufactured a wide range of phones targeted at specific audiences, leaving out features according to each narrow market. Its Bling line is embedded with Swarovski zircons but has no GPS, which Micromax assumed wasn't a priority for the fashion-concious audience. For teenagers, Micromax offers a candy-bar-size phone that has a full keypad for sending text messages but doesn't have the third-generation chip for Web browsing that is standard on many other phones. Micromax says parents won't foot a 3G phone's higher monthly bill. Micromax also is expanding outside India. It entered Nepal in 2010 and has since moved to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Arabian Peninsula and Brazil. Nigeria is next. The company had planned for an initial public offering last year but shelved the idea in a weak Indian stock market. ""We are already prepared for an IPO,"" Mr. Sharma says. ""The moment the market comes back with its normal swing, we'll be there."" Write to Megha Bahree at megha.bahree@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201203,HTC unit Beats close to buying music service MOG - source,"* Deal could be announced in next fortnight - source * MOG price will surpass investment in company - source * MOG could be sold with Beats headphones, HTC cellphones By Yinka Adegoke March 20 (Reuters) - Handset maker HTC Corp's Beats Electronics is close to buying the digital music subscription service MOG for an undisclosed sum, according to a person close to the talks. The company has been in discussion with Beats for weeks and the deal could be announced within the next fortnight, according to the source. A spokesman for Beats declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for MOG. Last month, MOG Chief Executive David Hyman denied the company was actively trying to sell itself after reports it is struggling in the competitive music subscription business. MOG has raised more than $33 million from investors and the price being discussed will surpass the investment, this person said. MOG now has more than 500,000 active users, Hyman said earlier this month, but he did not break out how many are fully paid-up subscribers. Since integrating the music service into Facebook last fall, nearly 5,000 new users a day have tried out the site, he said. HTC, which is the fifth largest smartphone maker in the world, has been looking to integrate music features such as Internet radio into its smartphones as a way to differentiate itself from rivals on the Android platform, as well as the iPhone. It took a controlling stake in Beats last year in a $300 million deal. An HTC spokesman said the Taiwan-based company does not comment on rumors and speculation. MOG could be integrated as a discounted offer to buyers of Beats' popular 'Beats by Dr Dre' headphones, HTC smartphones, or in laptops made by the Hewlett Packard Co, with which Beats has a separate partnership. COMPETITIVE SUBSCRIPTION MOG was founded in 2005 by Hyman and has raised $33 million from its two main backers, Menlo Ventures and Balderton Capital. The business is only 50 percent online subscriptions. The other half is its advertising network, called MOG Music Network, which places ads on more than 1,700 music sites. According to comScore data, the MOG network receives more than 60 million unique visitors a month. MOG is in a very competitive market alongside better known names such as Rhapsody and Spotify. These companies are trying to convince music lovers to change the habits of a lifetime and subscribe to unlimited access to on-demand songs and albums streamed over the Web to a user's PC or mobile phone, rather than buying downloads or physical CDs. Typically, these subscription services charge around $10 a month for access to millions of songs on both a user's PC and phone. Rhapsody, which has been around for more than a decade, has just over 1 million U.S. paying subscribers after it bought out Napster. Spotify, which has been very successful at raising its profile since it launched in the United States last summer, had some 400,000 paying U.S. subscribers by the start of 2012. The relatively slow take-up of paid subscriptions has been disappointing for music labels, which have struggled since the advent of digital music. The labels had been hoping the services would be more successful at beating back piracy and shrinking the dominance of Apple Inc's iTunes Music Store. ITunes accounts for some 70 percent music sales in the United States.

201203,UPDATE 1-Ziggo prices 804 mln euro IPO at top of range,"* Largest European IPO since July 2011 * Values company at 3.7 billion euros (Adds detail, background) By Kylie MacLellan and Roberta Cowan LONDON/AMSTERDAM, March 20 (Reuters) - Dutch cable company Ziggo priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its expected range on Tuesday, raising 804 million euros ($1.1 billion) for its shareholders and making it the biggest European listing since mid-2011. Ziggo said it had priced its IPO at 18.50 euros per share, at the top of an original 16.50 to 18.50 euro per share range. Its shares will debut on the Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange under the ticker ""ZIGGO.AS"" on Wednesday. The offering of a 21.7 percent stake, which the company said was many times oversubscribed at the offer price, values Ziggo at 3.7 billion euros. If a 15 percent overallotment option is exercised in full, the size of the IPO will rise to 25 percent of the company. Initially the firm said it would sell a 20 percent stake, but due to ""significant demand,"" from investors, Ziggo said on Monday it had increased the number of shares on offer. Around 11.5 percent of the offering, the largest in Europe since Spanish savings bank Bankia's 3.1 billion euro sale last July, was sold to Dutch retail investors. The sale, which did not include any new shares, will see majority owners private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Cinven reduce their stakes. Ziggo was built up by Warburg Pincus which initially invested in Multikabel in 2005, and then embarked on a build-up strategy with partner Cinven. The pair added Casema and Essent Kabelcom both in 2006 and @Home in 2007, after which the company was rebranded as Ziggo. ""We identified the Dutch cable market as an attractive and growing industry and then created a new national market leader by backing an exceptional management team to acquire and successfully integrate three regional cable companies,"" said Joseph Schull, head of Warburg Pincus in Europe. Ziggo competes in its home market with Liberty Global's cable firm UPC, and the Dutch telecoms incumbent Royal KPN. Both Ziggo and UPC have lured customers away from KPN with their bundled offers of television, high-speed internet and telephone service. Ziggo said it intends to reward investors with healthy dividends and has targeted a total dividend pay out in 2012 of 220 million euros. From 2013 onwards, it plans a dividend of at least 50 percent of free cash flow to equity. Ziggo, which reported revenues of 1.48 billion euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 835 million in 2011, intends to drive growth through a ""TV Everywhere"" strategy offering services across TVs, PCs, tablet computers and smartphones. It also has said it intends to grow the business by offering broadband internet and telephony services to business customers as well as to consumers. J.P.

201203,"UPDATE 2-HP to merge printer, PC arms in revamp -sources","(Adds analysts' comments, history of PC division) SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 (Reuters) - Hewlett Packard Co CEO Meg Whitman plans to combine the computing giant's PC and printing divisions in a major internal overhaul intended to spur combined sales of hardware to customers, two sources familiar with the move told Reuters. That reorganization, expected to be announced ""soon,"" would see printing division chief Vyomesh Joshi step down and current PC chief Todd Bradley head up the combined unit, the sources said on condition of anonymity, because the information was not yet public. Chief Executive Officer Whitman is looking to streamline the organization to make it easier for customers to buy the two products together, and to reinvest any savings into research and development, one of the sources said. HP, the largest U.S. technology company by revenue, is struggling to keep its core personal computing business in the black as mobile devices from tablets to smartphones eat into sales and is trying to reinvent itself as a major enterprise computing provider. The decades-old corporation, often mentioned in accounts of the founding of Silicon Valley, has been through its share of turmoil in past years. HP considered for months last year a proposal to sell or spin off its PC arm, known as the personal systems group. That emerged as the company announced it would get out of the business of making tablets with the failure of its TouchPad. But after Whitman's predecessor and former CEO Leo Apotheker was himself ousted in September for failing to revive a moribund stock, the company abandoned the idea and deemed personal computers core to its overall strategy. HP's moves evoked a mixed response from analysts. While they felt Whitman was moving at an impressive speed to fix issues at the company and jump-start growth, the advantages of the integration were unclear. ""It's too early to tell what this is going to do,"" Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said. ""The risk I think is that both (divisions) have very different business models."" A MOBILE WORLD Earnings plummeted 44 percent in the fiscal first quarter and revenue slid 7 percent as the once-storied institution -- which has changed CEOs twice in recent years -- struggled to galvanize computer sales. The most recent move is intended to reap the synergies of two divisions whose hardware products are often sold side-by-side, said the second source familiar with the plan. The company feels it makes more operational sense to integrate the two with combined product offers, the source said. ""Meg Whitman is moving quickly to institute changes, e.g., fewer silos, greater emphasis on R&D, more conservative expectations,"" ISI group analyst Brian Marshall said. ""Last week, we meet with the head of HP Labs and were impressed with the new organizational focus/direction put in place by CEO Whitman."" While HP still leads the market in PC sales, growth of that division has been dwindling as mobile usage takes off across the globe. Bradley would be overseeing the largest division within HP. Last year, the printing and PC group pulled in $65.35 billion of revenue in fiscal 2011. A former CEO of Palm, which HP acquired in 2010, he had previously been considered for the top job at HP following the ouster of Mark Hurd as CEO in 2010. Joshi, a veteran HP executive, would be stepping down after about 31 years at the company. He joined HP in 1980 as a research and development engineer. Tech blog AllThingsDigital first reported on the reorganization. The company declined to comment on the report. Shares in HP slid 1.2 percent to $24.04 in afternoon trade.

201203,ANALYSIS-Apple vs. Android: A courtroom war of attrition,"* Apple has not yet scored knockout patent blow * Big trials against Motorola and Samsung approaching * Wins could force licensing deals, clunkier Android By Dan Levine and Poornima Gupta SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 (Reuters) - Before his death, Apple Inc's Steve Jobs famously promised to go ""thermonuclear"" against smartphones running Google's Android software, saying they use technology ripped off from the iPhone. The massive legal attack he launched, now in its third year, didn't destroy Android. Instead, it's turned into a costly global war of attrition. In case after case involving dozens of patents, Apple has won small victories that force rivals into temporary retreat by requiring them to remove minor features from their devices. Apple has, in turn, lost some rounds and been forced to rework some of its products. Two upcoming cases in the United States - one against Motorola and the other against Samsung - have the potential to strike deeper blows on either side. The trials involve the legal rights to the core technology behind smartphones and tablet computers and whoever loses could face large damages and increased costs. That could raise prices for consumers. If Apple wins, Android manufacturers will have to come up with critical fixes or pay Apple a hefty fee to keep using its technology, according to several technology and legal analysts. Apple's foes, however, say the iPhone and iPad maker is just as vulnerable to claims it took ideas from other companies. Both Motorola and Samsung have countersued Apple. At a January court hearing in the Motorola case, the judge suggested that, regardless of the outcome of the trial, neither side is going to achieve total victory. ""You're not going to shut down the smartphone,"" Chicago U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner told Apple's lawyer, according to a transcript. ""They're not going to shut down the iPhone."" Apple declined to discuss its patent strategy and has claimed in the past that its competitors ""slavishly"" copy the iPhone and iPad. The company has a larger share of the U.S. smartphone market than its rivals, thanks largely to the success of the iPhone 4S. Globally, however, Android devices outsell Apple. Android's global market share was nearly 50 percent, while Apple's iOS software, which runs its mobile devices, had about 19 percent in 2011, according to research firm IDC. Apple began its global patent fight against Android in March 2010, when it filed complaints against handset-maker HTC Corp began its global patent fight against Android in March 2010, when it filed complaints against handset-maker in federal court in Delaware and before the U.S. International Trade Commission. Litigation between Apple and Motorola broke out that October and Apple then sued Samsung in April 2011. The week Apple sued HTC, Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson he would ""spend every penny"" of Apple's then $40 billion cash pile on the Android fight. ""I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product,"" Jobs said. ""I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."" The company's cash has now grown to nearly $100 billion and Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, said on Monday that Apple would return some of it to investors as a dividend and buy back stock. Google supplies Android to the smartphone makers for free, but has not been directly involved in the lawsuits because it does not make its own phone. Its pending acquisition of Motorola, though, will change that. Among Apple's incremental victories so far is a German court injunction against Motorola over the ""slide-to-unlock"" feature on smartphones, a signature iPhone maneuver that allows users to access their phones without pressing too many buttons. Motorola said it implemented a new design for the feature and that the injunction, handed down last month, would not impact the current supply or future sales. In another example of Apple's success against competitors, Samsung changed the metal frame around the Galaxy Tab after a German court ruled for Apple last September. Speaking broadly, Samsung spokesman Kevin Kim said in an email the company is confident the litigation will not impact its ability to provide mobile products to consumers. Yet Apple has also had to change features on its products. Motorola won an injunction in Germany against Apple's iCloud push email function shortly after it lost on the ""slide to unlock"" feature. Push email, a widely used technology, automatically informs users about new messages on phones and tablets. Apple played down the impact of the injunction in Germany, saying consumers could adjust their settings so that devices download new email at regular intervals. When tech companies are forced to rework devices due to patent challenges, the risk is that the changes will annoy consumers and eventually cause them to switch products, said Colleen Chien, an IP professor at Santa Clara Law in Silicon Valley. CHICAGO SHOWDOWN Apple's main U.S. case against Motorola, over six of its patents, goes to trial in June before Posner, a renowned federal judge with a keen interest in intellectual property. He wrote an economic analysis of IP law - one of his dozens of books. Posner has handed Apple some early victories on how language in Apple's patents will be defined for a jury - a crucial step in patent litigation. For instance, he adopted Apple's definition of a patent covering how Skype and other streaming video applications operate on smartphones. A win for Apple on these kinds of patents - which cover core functions on phones - would force Motorola to either attempt a difficult technical fix, or to strip out the feature entirely, said Nick Rodelli, a lawyer and adviser to institutional investors for CFRA Research in Maryland. Apple has said in court papers that a win on core patents would mean a ""substantial overhaul"" of Android, costing tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars for Motorola. ""That's the game they're playing to win,"" Rodelli said. Motorola is asserting three of its own patents against Apple relating to how data is transmitted wirelessly. Those are set for a second trial in June, also before Posner. ""We developed and patented technology 10 years ago in areas Apple is claiming to have invented five years later,"" said Neill Taylor, Motorola's chief IP counsel. Taylor added that, if his company wins, Apple has much more to lose due to the volume of iPhone sales. At the January hearing, Posner said that to win damages, Apple and Motorola would have to show how each patented feature impacted phone sales. FIGHTING SAMSUNG IN CALIFORNIA In the other U.S. federal trial, Apple and Samsung are battling over the South Korean company's Galaxy line of smartphones and tablets, which also use Android. The trial is set for July in San Jose, California, before U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who rejected Apple's attempt last year to get a quick shutdown of Samsung phone and tablet sales during the Christmas holiday. Apple still wants the sales ban and is appealing Koh's ruling. Apple also has filed a barrage of new claims against Samsung in the California court, while Samsung has countersued. The two companies also have hearings scheduled before the ITC. The July trial features Apple patents such as one that covers how touch-screen devices discriminate between one finger on the screen, or more, and respond accordingly. This is a patent that goes to the core of how the devices operate, said David Sunshine, an IP lawyer who advises hedge funds for Cozen O'Conner, a law firm in New York. An Apple win, he said, would be costly for Samsung. ""They haven't hit the holy grail yet,"" Sunshine said. ""But they've had some victories and they're hoping for that big victory.""

201203,Windows Phone surpasses Symbian in Britain -survey,"* Windows Phone UK market share 2.5 pct, Symbian 2.4 pct * Google, Apple still dominate March 20 (Reuters) - Sales of smartphones with Microsoft Windows software have surpassed those using Nokia's old Symbian system in Britain, research showed on Tuesday, a sign of progress in Nokia's switch to Microsoft software. Data for the three months to mid-February, after the launch of Nokia's Windows-based Lumia 800 model, showed Microsoft's market share rose 5-fold to 2.5 percent in the British market, which is considered an indicator of Europe-wide trends. Market share for Symbian decreased to 2.4 percent from 12.4 percent a year earlier, according to Kantar. While data showed the market is increasingly dominated by Google's Android with a 48.5 percent share and Apple with 28.7 percent, Kantar said it represented a milestone for Nokia's adoption of Windows Phone 7 (WP7). ""There are strong signs that WP7 Nokia handsets are starting to make an impact on the European smartphone market though U.S. sales, where the Nokia brand is weaker, remain underwhelming,"" Kantar analyst Dominic Sunnebo said in a statement. ""The fact that WP7 sales have overtaken Symbian based on one handset is encouraging; however, Nokia will need to expand the range quickly in order to keep up with the slew of next generation competitor products being launched in quarter two."" Lumia 800 took 87 percent of Windows Phone sales in Britain, according to the research. The Windows Phone share of the U.S. market shrank to 1.6 percent in the 12 week period, from 3.5 percent a year earlier.

201203,"A look at how selected chip-makers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: Jan. 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC say personal computer shipments dipped during the final three months of last year amid a shortage of key parts or compelling innovations. Based on preliminary figures, Gartner is pegging the worldwide shipment decline at 1.4 percent from a year earlier, and IDC calculated the decrease at 0.2 percent. The slight downturn had been expected for several reasons, chiefly the growing popularity of mobile devices. That was compounded in the fourth quarter by hard-drive shortages because of flooding in Thailand and the fact that many products were either uninspiring or overpriced, according to analysts at Gartner and IDC. Jan. 19: IBM Corp. reports fourth-quarter earnings and an outlook for the year that were stronger than expected. The latest results were helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. The company offered a welcome sign of stability amid the global economic turmoil that's prompting worries about a slowdown in technology spending by businesses and governments, who are IBM's customers. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Intel's results, like Apple's in recent quarters, have benefited from the economic surge in China and other developing countries, where many people are buying PCs for the first time. Microsoft Corp. reports flat earnings in the latest quarters, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. The quarter wasn't as bad as some industry analysts feared, given that flooding in Thailand constricted the supply of hard disk drives used in personal computers. Microsoft also witnessed a wave of consumers buying Apple Inc.'s popular iPad, which cut into sales of miniature laptop PCs known as netbooks. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. reports results that topped analyst estimates. The company credits improving demand for most of the company's products, leading TI to believe that the company is moving beyond a downturn that undercut its financial performance for most of last year. The company, however, offered a tepid forecast for the first quarter of this year. Hard disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. says its second-quarter net income fell 36 percent as it took a $199 million charge related to flooding in Thailand. Jan. 24: Apple Inc., which had uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter, reports results that vastly exceed analyst estimates and set new records. Apple Inc. says it sold 37 million iPhones in the quarter, more than twice as many as it sold a year earlier. For the first time, iPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's sales. Sales of iPads were also strong, with more than 15 million shipped, again more than double from a year earlier. Sales of Mac computers were more modest, but still growing. Apple sold 5.2 million Macs during the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. EMC Corp., the world's largest maker of data-storage computers, provides further evidence that the shift to cloud computing is creating a favorable business climate. With cloud computing, services and software are run on computers located elsewhere instead of on a single computer at a desk. EMC's results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. AMD lost 24 cents per share, compared with earnings of 50 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD says it earned 19 cents per share in the latest quarter. Altera Corp., a maker of computer chips, says net income fell 37 percent from a year earlier. Revenue fell 18 percent. The company says ""industry conditions"" led to declines in the quarter, but growth for the full year was up 6 percent. Jan. 25: Xerox Corp.'s business of providing services to businesses, to help them manage documents and processes, was the star of the quarter, with revenue up 6 percent. That was balanced by a 5 percent drop in sales of machines and supplies. SanDisk Corp., which makes memory chips for electronics such as smartphones and tablets, says fourth-quarter net income fell 42 percent on higher costs and one-time charges. Adjusted results beat expectations, but gross margin -- the percentage of each dollar in revenue a company actually keeps -- was hurt by higher costs. LSI Corp., which makes semiconductors for data storage and networking, gives a first-quarter forecast above Wall Street expectations and reassures investors that the troubles from hard drive shortages are under control. Jan. 31: Seagate Technology PLC, a maker of hard disk drives, says net income in the latest quarter nearly quadrupled to $563 million. Revenue grew 3 percent to $2.59 billion. Both its revenue and adjusted profit soundly beat Wall Street expectations. Seagate earlier said that it had shipped more hard drives than expected, despite troubles at its manufacturing plants from flooding in Thailand. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says global demand for smartphones has boosted sales. The company also says new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. It set its earnings and revenue forecasts above analyst expectations for the current quarter. Feb. 8: Lenovo Group Ltd. says quarterly profit grew by more than half, but it warns that hard drive costs would remain high amid a global shortage caused by flooding in Thailand. The No. 2 PC maker says it's confident of closing in on the top spot as it reports strong sales growth across all major markets even as it focuses more attention on the burgeoning smartphone and mobile Internet market. Feb. 15: Nvidia Corp. reports adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, above the 20 cents expected by analysts. Revenue of $953 million was slightly above expectations of $951 million. The company credits demand from gamers and professionals for machines that use its graphics-processing chips. But its outlook disappointed. Revenue for the current quarter was projected at $900 million to $930 million, below the $944 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. NetApp Inc., which makes data-storage management systems, reports adjusted profit and revenue for the November-January period, its fiscal third quarter, that matched analyst expectations. The company says it signed up a record number of new customers. Feb. 16: Applied Materials Inc., a maker of chip equipment, says adjusted profit in the recent quarter topped Wall Street expectations. Management gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The company says global demand for mobile devices is driving investment by its semiconductor customers. Applied Materials serves as a barometer for technology spending because major makers of chips and LCD screens and even solar cells are big customers who depend on its equipment. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. says fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent as the computer maker had a tougher time selling its products to cost-cutting government agencies and to consumers who have been embracing sleeker options from rival Apple Inc. Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says sales to consumers dropped 23 percent from a year earlier. HP is the world's largest maker of PCs, but it's been performing badly as buyers in the industrialized world are turning their attention to Apple's iPads and Macs. Meanwhile, it hasn't been able to capture the growing appetite for PCs in emerging markets. Revenue from commercial businesses fell 4 percent. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. says it closed four times the number of seven-figure deals in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In the current quarter, the company got its first nine-figure deal ever. Marvell Technology Group Ltd. says its profit sank 64 percent in its fourth quarter and gives a lackluster sales outlook. The company expects hard disk memory sales to bounce back as much as 20 percent, but anticipates wireless segment sales to decline sequentially in the current quarter due to seasonal factors. It also expects networking sales to be flat. Feb. 29: Microsoft begins letting consumers try out its upcoming touch-based Windows 8 operating system. It aims to power a new wave of tablet computers and traditional PCs designed to counter Apple's big gains in the market through its Macs and iPads. March 7: Apple announces a third version of its iPad. March 8: Chip-maker Texas Instruments lowers its first-quarter guidance, citing weakened demand for wireless products. Research firm Gartner forecasts that PC shipments will grow 4.4 percent worldwide this year after a small drop in 2011. That's relatively weak growth as consumer attention turns to tablets. Tuesday: Oracle Corp. says sales of new software licenses picked up in its latest quarter, helping to ease concerns about the company's future as it loses customers to rivals offering less expensive alternatives. Total revenue grew just 3 percent in the December-February period. But revenue from new software licenses went up 7 percent, helping to offset defections to companies that specialize in Internet-based software known as cloud computing. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,What recent tech industry earnings reveal about the state of spending and the economy,"Here is a summary of recent earnings and reports for selected technology companies and what they reveal about the state of spending and the overall economy: Jan. 18: EBay Inc. says its net income grew sharply in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its remaining investment in Skype. Its results beat Wall Street's expectations, boosted by strong holiday sales at its namesake website and growth at PayPal, its online payments business. Jan. 19: A slowdown in Google Inc.'s earnings growth alarms investors. Net income edged up just 6 percent from the same October-December period in 2010, coming off year-over-year increases of more than 25 percent in each of the previous two quarters. IBM Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by higher revenue and profit margins in the technology icon's lucrative software and services segments. Intel Corp., the world's largest chip-maker, says its profit rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, topping analyst expectations, even as hard-drive shortages held back PC makers' chip orders. Microsoft Corp. battled through a weak PC market to post flat earnings in the latest quarter, boosting sales of servers, Xbox games and its Office productivity software while trimming losses at its Bing search engine. Jan. 23: Texas Instruments Inc. says it will close computer-chip factories in Houston and Japan in a cost-cutting move that will lay off about 1,000 workers, or about 3 percent of its workforce. Fourth-quarter results topped analyst estimates. Jan. 24: Apple Inc. reports results that vastly exceeds analyst estimates and sets new records. That came after uncharacteristically tepid sales in the July-to-September quarter. Apple says net income in the latest quarter was $13.87 per share, more than double the $6.43 per share a year ago and above analyst estimates of $10.04 per share. Yahoo Inc.'s latest financial results show the Internet company is still losing ground in the battle for online advertising. Earnings in the latest quarter were down 5 percent and matched analysts' expectations. However, Yahoo fell short on a key metric. After subtracting advertising commissions, Yahoo's revenue totaled $1.17 billion -- $20 million below analyst projections. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports a loss for the fourth quarter, after the chip-maker wrote down the value of an investment in its former GlobalFoundries unit by $209 million and recorded $98 million in restructuring costs. After excluding one-time items, AMD earned 19 cents per share. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 16 cents per share. EMC Corp.'s results for the latest quarter surged past analyst estimates while the forecast for this year called for double-digit growth in earnings and revenue. It's a further sign that the world's largest maker of data-storage computers is benefiting from a shift to cloud computing, in which companies run software and services on remote computers. Jan. 25: Netflix Inc. says its net income fell 14 percent in the latest quarter, partly because of subscriber defections that followed a price increase of up to 60 percent in the U.S. However, Netflix was able to regain some of the lost U.S. customers to end the year at 24.4 million, up 600,000 from the end of September. Xerox Corp. says fourth-quarter net income more than doubled as the company put some restructuring behind it and benefited from a freeze on a number of its pension plans. Excluding special items, Xerox earned 33 cents per share, matching analyst expectations. Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. says its profit slumped 53 percent in the fourth quarter but its revenue rose 7 percent on stronger sales of glass for flat-screen televisions, computers and mobile devices. Motorola Solutions Inc., which sells communications equipment to government and corporate customers, says its fourth-quarter net income shrank because of the cost of stock-based compensation for employees and other charges. But adjusted results beat expectations as client demand rose. Jan. 26: Mobile phone maker Nokia Corp. reports a fourth-quarter net loss of (EURO)1.07 billion ($1.38 billion) as sales slumped 21 percent even as the company's first Windows smartphones hit markets in Europe and Asia. The loss, widened by a (EURO)1 billion loss booked on Nokia's navigation systems unit, compares with a profit of (EURO)745 million a year earlier. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. reports a fourth-quarter loss, as it battles competition in the smartphone and computer tablet market. The company released preliminary numbers three weeks ago. Analysts lowered their earnings estimates then when Motorola warned the period would be a letdown. Jan .27: Samsung Electronics Co. reports a 17 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit on the strength of smartphone sales even as the company battled claims it had copied iPhone. The company, however, reports an operating loss in its display division despite a sales increase of 19 percent from the previous year. Jan. 31: Amazon.com Inc. says its fourth-quarter net income dropped sharply, weighed down by higher operating expenses as the company continued to invest in its long-term growth plans at the expense of short-term earnings. More surprisingly, revenue grew at a slower clip than Wall Street had expected. The company also gives a disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Investors punish the online retailer's stock. Feb. 1: Qualcomm Inc., a maker of chips for mobile devices, says profit in the latest quarter rose 16 percent as rising global demand for smartphones boosted sales. The company also raises its outlook for its current fiscal year and says that new 3G and 4G wireless networks should increase its sales opportunities during 2012. Feb. 8: Cisco Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, says net income jumped 44 percent in the latest quarter as it continues to put last year's slump behind it. Cisco has emerged leaner after a round of layoffs and a narrowing of its focus. Feb. 9: LinkedIn reports a strong fourth quarter as the online professional-networking service added 14 million members. Its net income and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. The results offer further evidence of online networking's popularity and moneymaking potential as Facebook prepares for an initial public offering of stock. Feb. 21: Dell Inc. issues fourth-quarter results that are slightly below analyst estimates, as were Dell's revenue projection for the current quarter. The stock price dropped nearly 5 percent Feb. 22: Hewlett-Packard Co., the maker of PCs and printers, says net income fell 44 percent, while sales fell 7 percent in the first full quarter under new CEO Meg Whitman. Contributing factors included weak demand from consumers and the shortage in disk drives. Feb. 23: Salesforce.com Inc. reports strong earnings that validated its approach of delivering software and services over the Internet rather than on individual computers. Some of the initial enthusiasm cooled, though, after investors factored in growth from a change in billing frequency. Monday: Adobe Systems Inc. says its net income fell 21 percent, weighed by higher operating costs even as revenue climbed. Adobe booked $648 million in operating costs in the latest quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier due to higher sales, marketing and other expenses. Tuesday: Oracle Corp. says its earnings rose 18 percent despite meager revenue growth during the December-February quarter. If not for acquisition expenses and other costs, Oracle says it would have earned 62 cents per share, soundly exceeding the 56 cents expected by analysts.

201203,Reports: Hewlett-Packard to combine printer and PC units as it tries to turn itself around,"NEW YORK (AP) - Hewlett-Packard Co. is combining its printing and PC units to save money, according to published reports. The technology blog AllThingsD first reported the restructuring plan Tuesday citing anonymous sources. HP would not comment. The move comes at a time when sales of printers and ink, once HP's lifeblood, are falling amid declining demand and growing competition. HP is the world's No. 1 maker of personal computers. But PC sales are hurting, too, as people turn their attention to tablets and smartphones. Aside from external factors, Hewlett-Packard also faces internal problems, something CEO Meg Whitman acknowledged in a February conference call. ""We didn't make the investments we should have during the past few years to stay ahead of customer expectations and market trends,"" she told analysts after HP reported lower earnings and revenue. ""As a result, we see eroding revenue and profits today."" Whitman became HP's CEO in September, replacing Leo Apotheker, who served just 11 months before he was ousted. Whitman is the company's third chief executive in less than three years. Apotheker had announced that HP was looking to sell or spin off its PC division, but under Whitman's guidance the company said it will keep the unit. HP said last month that it plans to spend several years turning itself around. The expected combination of its PCs and printer units is part of that plan, and will likely lead to job cuts and cost savings, according to reports. Together, the two units made up about half of HP's $30 billion revenue in the first quarter. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201203,"How Japan's Sharp Lost Its Edge; 'We Haven't Had a Good Understanding of the Market,' Electronics Maker's Next President Explains","TOKYO—Sharp Corp.'s domestic liquid-crystal-display factories once made the company a source of pride for Japan's electronics sector. Now it has taken on a less impressive mantle: Symbol of a sector struggling to compete globally. ""Severe"" is how Sharp's incoming president described the situation to reporters on Monday. Sharp expects this fiscal year to record the biggest annual loss in the company's 99-year history. The company suffered from weak demand across most of its largest product lines—television sets, LCD screens and solar panels—with a strong yen hurting cost-competitiveness. Underscoring the difficult conditions, the world's No. 5 maker of TV sets said last week that it will replace President Mikio Katayama with Takashi Okuda, a 34-year company veteran and the head of its overseas operations. ""Even though we possess technology to make good products, we haven't been able to launch them in a timely manner because we haven't had a good understanding of the market,"" said the 58-year-old Mr. Okuda, who will take his new post next month. He offered little detail regarding what Sharp plans to do to halt losses. On the heels of loss forecasts totaling ¥1.29 trillion ($15.46 billion) for the fiscal year that ends this month, Sharp, Panasonic Corp. and Sony Corp. announced management changes. In each case, the new executive promised to speed up operations. All three companies, the titans of Japan's consumer-electronics industry, are suffering from losses at their TV-set businesses, failing to keep pace with the innovations of Apple Inc. and unable to match the manufacturing might of Samsung Electronics Co. Sharp, the smallest of the trio, is especially vulnerable because of its aggressive investments in LCD and solar panels, where price competition has been brutal. Sharp also doesn't carry the brand cachet of Sony or Panasonic. ""What makes the situation really tough is that the very businesses Sharp bet on as its growth drivers are now the biggest drags on its earnings,"" said analyst Nobuo Kurahashi at Mizuho Investors Securities. Sharp, whose 1915 breakthrough product was the ""ever-sharp"" mechanical pencil, has seen its recent fortunes rise and fall with liquid-crystal displays, a technology that Sharp first used in calculators during the 1970s. After decades of research and development, Sharp cashed in when the TV industry shifted from bulky sets to sleek, flat-panel models in the early 2000s. With its strong LCD manufacturing legacy and state-of-the-art Japanese factories, Sharp's profit rose ninefold between 2002 and 2007. It dominated the Japanese TV-set market during those boom years, touting its domestic production as a sign of unmatched quality. Sharp continued to expand its production with increasingly ambitious LCD plants, including a $5 billion complex in western Japan in 2009. But the good times came to a halt when the domestic TV market slumped last year after a government stimulus plan ended. Meanwhile, a global slowdown meant Sharp's customers needed fewer panels. The company was saddled with an inventory glut. The solar business, another pillar of Sharp's operations, meanwhile is deep in the red. Since Sharp manufactures most of its solar panels in Japan, the strong yen has hurt its ability to export its panels at a competitive price. And solar-panel makers generally are facing tough conditions as low-cost Chinese manufacturers flood the market with supply. Demand in Japan hasn't met bullish projections and European sales have tapered off. In the fastest-growing segments of the consumer-electronics industry—tablet computers and smartphones—Sharp's products haven't fared much better. Sharp scaled back output of its Galapagos tablet less than a year after its debut. Sharp's smartphones fare well in Japan but have scant presence overseas.

201203,Apple Sells 3 Million New iPads in First Weekend,"5:09 p.m. | Updated Adding information on preorders. Apple said on Monday that it had already sold more than three million new iPads during the product's first weekend on the market, including preorders. That's triple the number of iPad 2 tablets that analysts estimated the company sold during that product's opening weekend last year, though the company did not take advance orders for the iPad 2. The new iPad, which was released on Friday in about a dozen countries, has a starting price of $500. Its main new features include an improved display, a better camera, a faster processor and support for AT&T's and Verizon's fourth-generation LTE cellular networks. Apple last year did not disclose sales numbers for the debut of the iPad 2. However, analysts estimated that Apple sold one million over its first weekend. The first iPad took 28 days to hit one million sales, according to Apple. The new iPad's opening weekend sales still don't top the performance of the iPhone. Apple said it sold four million of its iPhone 4S smartphones on its first weekend. * Daily Report: Imagining the New iPad * As New iPad Debut Nears, Some See Decline of PCs * Apple Confirms March 7 Event for New iPad * The Next iPad: Rounding Up the Chatter * Apple May Announce an iPad Upgrade in March The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120319e83j0043n ",NYT Blogs,19 March 2012,247 words,apple sell million new ipads first weekend,pm updated adding information preorders apple said monday already sold three million new ipads product first weekend market including preorders thats triple number ipad tablet analyst estimated company opening last year though take advance ipad ipad released friday dozen country starting price main feature improved display camera faster processor support atts verizons fourthgeneration lte cellular network disclose sale debut ipad however estimated one ipad took day hit according ipads dont top performance iphone four iphone smartphones daily report imagining ipad ipad nears see decline pc confirms march event ipad next ipad rounding chatter may announce ipad york time document nytbejn
201204,Corporate News: Corporate Watch,"SNC-LAVALIN Former Construction Chief Is Arrested in Switzerland SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. said late Sunday that its former construction head, Riadh Ben Aissa, has been placed under arrest in Switzerland. The Montreal-based company, one of the world's largest engineering and construction concerns, said on its website that it has no details on his status. Mr. Ben Aissa, a former executive vice president, left the company on Feb. 9. SNC said an investigation is under way by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and that limits how much it can discuss publicly. It is ""committed to cooperating fully with any authorities,"" it said. The company also said it ""voluntarily and proactively turned the results of our internal investigation over to the authorities."" The company has been under scrutiny for months over its past business dealings with the fallen Gadhafi regime in Libya. In March, SNC released the results of an internal investigation, saying that it doesn't believe that inappropriate payments were related to Libya. The investigation led to the resignation of its chief executive, Pierre Duhaime, who allegedly breached company policies by approving $56 million in payments that the company says were inappropriate. Mr. Ben Aissa's lawyer, Emmanuel Laurin-Legare, wasn't immediately available to comment. The RCMP declined to comment. -- Caroline Van Hasselt --- INTUIT TurboTax Maker to Buy Software Company Intuit Inc. said it has agreed to acquire software company Demandforce Inc. for $423.5 million in cash, as the tax-software maker looks to expand its customer base among small and midsize businesses. The deal, expected to close in May, is expected to add one to two percentage points to Intuit's revenue growth in fiscal 2013 and will be neutral to ""modestly"" dilutive to earnings in fiscal 2012 and 2013. Intuit, which makes TurboTax and QuickBooks, said the acquisition accelerates the company's expansion into high-value software as a product for small businesses. San Francisco-based Demandforce's email, mobile and social tools -- which include online reviews -- help small businesses automate marketing and customer communications. Intuit said Demandforce has achieved strong traction in industries such as dental, automotive, spas, optometry and chiropractors. -- Natalie Tadena --- FOXCONN INTERNATIONAL Handset Maker Warns Of Deeper First-Half Loss Contract handset maker Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. said Friday it expects its loss in this year's first half to widen significantly from a year earlier as demand from major customers such as Nokia Corp. weakens further. Foxconn International is a unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. of Taiwan. While Hon Hai Precision assembles Apple Inc.'s iPhones and iPads -- and is often referred to as Foxconn -- its Hong Kong unit Foxconn International makes handsets mainly for Nokia and other clients. Foxconn International also attributed its losses to unfavorable pricing and increased costs associated with product migrations. The company posted a loss of $17.65 million for the first half of last year. The company's poor performance comes as Nokia continues to struggle in a smartphone market where Apple of the U.S. and Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea are becoming dominant. -- Polly Hui and Juro Osawa --- GOODYEAR Debt Refinancing Pushes Tire Maker to a Loss Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. reported its first quarterly loss in more than a year as tire orders fell and the company spent money to refinance its debt. Goodyear posted a net loss of $11 million, or five cents a share, compared with a profit of $103 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding some items -- such as a 35-cent-a-share refinancing charge -- earnings were 34 cents a share. Sales rose 2% to $5.5 billion. In North America, operating profit doubled to $80 million. -- Jeff Bennett --- MERCK Drug Maker's Earnings Rose 67% on Lower Costs Merck & Co. posted a 67% increase in first-quarter profit amid lower costs, while a deceleration in sales growth for blockbuster diabetes drug Januvia and a decline in alliance revenue contributed to modest overall revenue growth. Merck, like its rivals, has been cutting costs as part of an effort to soften the hit from increased generic competition. For the first quarter, Merck earned $1.74 billion, or 56 cents a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings rose to 99 cents a share from 92 cents. Sales rose 1% to $11.73 billion. -- Peter Loftus Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Profits Don't Always Stick in China's Web,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary] The only thing growing faster than China's e-commerce sector seems to be the losses of firms burning cash to gain market share. Higher incomes, an expanding pool of Internet users and the rise of smartphones mean online retail in China is booming. In 2011, the number of Internet users rose 12% to 513 million. E-commerce transaction value jumped 55% to 806 billion yuan ($127 billion), according to data from Analysys. Even so, cut-throat competition means turning a profit isn't easy. The 800 pound gorilla in China's e-commerce sector is Alibaba Group, which claimed 72% of the market by transaction value in the final quarter of 2011 through its Taobao and Tmall sites, according to Analysys. Everyone else is playing catch-up. 360buy, which sells everything from consumer electronics to underwear, accounts for just 5% of the market. Amazon, online bookseller Dangdang and Yihaodian -- in which Wal-Mart Stores has a stake -- languish with less than 1% each. Bricks and mortar electronics retailers Suning and Gome are muscling in as well, and instant messaging company Tencent is using its existing online presence to support its Paipai e-commerce site. With no one specializing in a particular niche, a competitive bloodbath results. Fierce price cutting twinned with high costs for building out distribution networks savage margins. Dangdang's gross margin in the fourth quarter was 10.5%, compared with 22.4% a year earlier. Sean O'Rourke, China e-commerce analyst at RedTech Advisors, thinks aggressive discounting by 360buy means its margins are even lower. Alibaba's third-party sales model, where it collects a fee from vendors, provides some protection from margin pressure. For everybody else, with profitability a distant prospect, deep pockets are required. This works better for some than others. Amazon's strong U.S. business means it could bankroll its Chinese online outfit for a long time. Dangdang, which had a loss in 2011, doesn't have that luxury. In the early days of the Internet the problem was that no one knew how to generate revenue. Now the problem in China is that everybody does. Fierce competition means the only winners so far are consumers. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,What's News—,"Business & Finance *** As multinational firms posted earnings, Big-equipment makers like Caterpillar and ABB reported slowing demand in China, while consumer-focused Apple and Starbucks experienced surges. The mixed signals could be an early sign of change in China's economy toward emphasizing consumer spending. If sustained, the trend could lead to stable growth, though not at the double-digit pace that the country had averaged. China Postal Express & Logistics plans to raise $1.58 billion in an IPO, joining a growing list of state-run firms eager to tap the domestic stock market. Felda Global Ventures plans an IPO that could raise more than $3 billion. The Malaysian state-controlled palm-oil company's offering would be one of the biggest world-wide so far this year. The Bank of Japan increased its purchases of government bonds despite its concerns that being perceived as monetizing public debt could bring an unwanted jump in interest rates. Indonesia's central bank is planning to set caps on single-shareholder stakes in commercial banks next month, in a move that could delay the biggest-ever acquisition in the country. Japan Tobacco reported strong earnings and an impressive rise in its share price, despite its presence in a problematic sector and a falling domestic market. Tepco agreed to a $12.46 billion bailout by the government, in a landmark move for Japan's biggest utility that could aid the cleanup of last year's nuclear disaster and help precipitate a shake-up of the power industry. Samsung Electronics's profit jumped to a record on soaring sales of smartphones and apparently pushed the South Korean company past Nokia as the world's biggest cellphone seller—and perhaps past Apple as No. 1 in smartphones. South Korea put Woori Finance, the nation's largest financial holding company by assets, up for sale in its third privatization attempt. Indonesia's Bakrie family was given more time to respond to lenders' request for additional collateral on a $440 million loan. Slowing earnings growth and doubts the Fed will pump even more cash into markets are raising concerns about the outlook for U.S. stocks. Some investors say it will be harder to achieve meaningful gains. P&G's CEO was blasted by stock analysts for poor performance at the world's largest consumer-products company. The stock posted its largest drop in more than two years. ArcelorMittal is focusing its investments on Canada, Brazil and Liberia, but India, where it has made little headway with three high-profile steel projects, doesn't figure high on its list of investment candidates. World-Wide *** Malaysia's prime minister could delay calling elections, which were widely expected in the next few months, in the aftermath of a weekend protest during which police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators. Saudi Arabia closed its embassy in Egypt's capital and withdrew its ambassador amid protests by hundreds of Egyptians, sparking a diplomatic crisis just as Egypt's economy is most in need of assistance from its wealthy neighbor. French President Sarkozy and Socialist François Hollande entered the crucial final stretch of the presidential race, with the incumbent courting far-right voters and his rival seeking to focus the debate on European issues.

201204,Social gifting: the new buzzword in e-commerce,"* Sweden's Wrapp, other startups, win venture-cap backing * Nascent industry carries big growth potential -investors * Retailers like potential sales boost, low marketing cost By Nivedita Bhattacharjee April 30 (Reuters) - Last year, the buzzword in e-commerce was Groupon Inc and its myriad of competitors that offered daily online coupons to entice shoppers in a down economy. Now, the latest fashion in retail is social gifting, where people get together on Facebook to buy each other gifts. Start-ups such as Sweden-based Wrapp, which is launching its U.S. business on Monday, are getting millions of dollars in venture-capital funding, and retailers like Best Buy Co Inc, Gap Inc and Starbucks Corp are scurrying to be a part of it. ""Brick-and-mortar retailers are all looking for new, more efficient ways to drive sales into stores without diluting their brands ... we wanted to really see how retailers can leverage the megatrends of smartphones and social networks,"" said Hjalmar Winbladh, chief executive of Wrapp. Wrapp is essentially an app that can run on smartphones, tablets and computers. It allows Facebook friends to buy each other gift cards from participating retailers either individually or by teaming up, which they can store on their mobile devices and redeem either online or inside physical stores. Retailers like it because there is little marketing cost and because customers often end up buying more once they are inside the store. Since mid-November more than 165,000 active users have given over 1.4 million gift cards that can be redeemed in some 50 major retail stores across Europe, according to Wrapp. ""The thing that struck me as unique and interesting about Wrapp is that it is kind of the intersection of three trends: gift cards, social networks and mobile (shopping),"" said Reid Hoffman, a cofounder of LinkedIn and a partner at Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. Wrapp has received $10.5 million in funding from Greylock and technology VC firm Atomico. Hoffman serves on Wrapp's board, as does Skype co-founder and Atomico founder Niklas Zennström. In the United States, the Swedish company has tied up with retailers including H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB, Gap Inc, Sephora and Fab. E-gifting - or people buying gift cards from a retailer's website - is still in its infancy, accounting for only $1 billion of the $100 billion gift card industry last year, according to Brian Riley, senior research director at CEB TowerGroup. Of that $1 billion, social gifting made up only about 5 percent or $50 million. Technology is naturally progressing toward platforms like social gifting, said one industry player. ""E-commerce platforms are becoming inherently more social with the inclusion of comments, recommendations and purchase history from each person's social graph,"" said Randy Glein, managing director at venture capital firm DFJ Growth. THE RETAIL LINEUP Starbucks expects social gifting to make up about 20 percent of its gifting business in the near future. ""Customers can connect from our site to their registered Facebook account to view upcoming birthdays of Facebook friends, send them e-gifts directly, and share the news on their Facebook wall,"" said Alexandra Wheeler, vice president of global digital marketing at Starbucks. Bridget Dolan, vice president of interactive media at Sephora, said conversion rates - measuring the amount of customers who actually come to stores to redeem the vouchers - are likely to spike on holidays like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and just before Christmas. This optimism has a host of startups like CashStar, SocialGift, Groupcard Apps and DropGifts rushing in to be the early birds in the sector. CashStar, for example, works with more than 200 retailers for their e-gifting businesses, and has seen sales grow 463 percent in the latest quarter. Nearly 10 percent of CashStar's retailer network uses social gifting, CashStar Chief Executive David Stone said. ""Facebook commerce is still very nascent; it is a small, small world. Within that, social gifting is one area where we can potentially build sales,"" Stone said. While there are high hopes for the future of social gifting, it may be appropriate to remember last year's darling, Groupon. As a private company, Groupon was one of the fastest-growing businesses in history and in November pulled off one of the largest Internet IPOs of the past decade, valuing the company at well over $10 billion. But since the stock market debut, the shares have fallen around 40 percent on concern about the sustainability of that growth and the company's accounting. WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM? Retailers view social gifting as an opportunity to reach out to their target buyers and promote their brands at almost no extra cost. Wrapp, for instance, charges retailers nothing until a transaction is made. It bets on the premise that most shoppers will end up spending more than the gift card's value once they are in the store. ""As marketers, we want to be where the consumers are, and they are all on Facebook,"" said Bradford Robinson, gift card manager for Chili's Grill & Bar. Wrapp, which works with companies like home improvement chain Clas Ohlson and Dixons Retail-owned consumer electronics chain Elgiganten in Europe, said users reportedly spent 5.2 times the value of the gift card when they came to claim their gifts. ""I have no doubts that because of the FB platform, these things can grow very quickly and get a lot of users in a short period of time,"" said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research. But she also has a word of caution. ""It is new, and there is a lot that remains to be seen. It could be a very powerful form of marketing (and) drive incremental value. But the challenge is that there is a promise and there is a reality ... you can't just introduce a platform like this and expect it to deliver gold to everybody,"" she said.

201204,CORRECTED-PREVIEW-It's not a BlackBerry World anymore,"(Corrects third paragraph to change period to three months from five months) * New CEO Heins has little to offer at conference * RIM canceled specific presentation for analysts * Company may introduce upgraded PlayBook tablet * RIM conference takes place in Orlando May 1-3 By Alastair Sharp ORLANDO, Florida, April 30 (Reuters) - When Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie were running Research In Motion, BlackBerry World was a chest-thumping celebration of RIM's successes and a showcase for the innovations that would assure its continued dominance. Their successor Thorsten Heins will preside over a very different event. Three months after replacing the longstanding co-CEOs, Heins desperately needs more time to right the now-struggling company and he likely has next to nothing concrete to offer his restless audience in terms of new products and services. In late March, Heins embarked on a strategic review of the Canadian smartphone maker's direction in an effort to reverse the growing power of Apple Inc and Google Inc's Android, and to thwart a budding Microsoft/Nokia resurgence. The company is working furiously to get a next-generation lineup of smartphones on sale, while also seeking licensing deals, partnerships and cost savings of $1 billion this year. Unless Heins has a big surprise up his sleeve at this year's BlackBerry World, held next week in Orlando, Florida, analysts expect him to focus on products and services already in market. Most of them have so far failed to capture the imagination of investors or consumers. ""It's too early in RIM's strategic review process to announce one particular strategy,"" IDC analyst Kevin Restivo said. ""However, Heins would be wise to provide any kind of news to help staunch the bleeding."" Restivo expects RIM to tout any progress it's made in attracting developers and possibly announce a PlayBook that connects to cellular networks. That would make the 7-inch tablet more portable and give carriers an incentive to promote the device. PRESENTATION DELAYED BlackBerry World - which brings together several thousand RIM partners and customers - was once a must for financial analysts. But this year few are making the trip, in part because RIM has broken with tradition by cancelling a specific presentation for them. Instead it delayed the briefing until the next-generation BlackBerry 10s are on sale, sometime later this year. In the year since RIM's last Orlando conference, the company has issued a string of disappointing financial results, suffered an embarrassing global network outage and watched its share price tumble by 75 percent. Lazaridis and Balsillie quit under pressure in late January, replaced by Heins, a former Siemens AG executive who ran RIM's hardware business for several years. ""Expectations are so low I don't think it's possible to disappoint investors,"" said National Bank Financial analyst Kris Thompson. ""The conference isn't for investors anyway; it's for customers, developers and partners."" Thompson said RIM may use the event to introduce a marketing chief, which he said was long overdue. RIM is also seeking a chief operating officer. ""The company needs to display confidence and staying power at the show to keep this constituency loyal until the BlackBerry 10 smartphones are launched,"" he said. Other RIM watchers privately pointed to subdued comments from a major investor and new board member last week as a hint not to expect much. Prem Watsa, who joined RIM's board in January's reshuffle, said that a turnaround could take three to five years. LOOKING AHEAD The BlackBerry 10 devices will be RIM's first smartphones to make use of a hardy operating platform from QNX Software, an Ottawa, Ontario-based company that RIM acquired in 2010. RIM's first test of QNX was its PlayBook tablet, which has languished on store shelves since its launch a year ago. The company is eager to get software developers to build PlayBook applications that could then populate an app store for the new phones. On the sidelines of BlackBerry World, the company will hand out a prototype BlackBerry 10 device for developers to test their software applications. RIM has stressed that the device's hardware bears no relation to the finished product. The BlackBerry was once seen as an indispensable business tool but has been eclipsed by more consumer-focused iPhones and Android devices which boast large, vivid touchscreens and hundreds of thousands more applications and games. RIM had an 8.8 percent slice of the global smartphone market in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Gartner, down from 14.6 percent a year ago. Apple and Android smartphones accounted for almost three-quarters of the market, up from less than half a year earlier. Meanwhile, a partnership between Microsoft Corp and Nokia Oyj threatens both RIM's corporate heartland and its recent growth markets internationally. By the time RIM launches its first BlackBerry 10s, its global share could slip to 6 percent, analysts at Canaccord Genuity said in February. They said the small base would make it difficult for RIM to create an ecosystem of applications and content for its new platform. Recognizing it is powerless to stop iPhones and Android devices from invading its once-inpenetrable corporate and government business, RIM launched its Mobile Fusion software to enable IT managers to control those devices through RIM's servers. But it has so far failed to go further. Sources told Reuters last month that former co-chief executive Balsillie had worked for months on a radical shift in RIM's strategy that would have offered use of its proprietary network, including its popular BlackBerry Messenger chat program, for rival devices such as the iPhone. Heins has since said he believes in RIM's integrated model - in which it runs its own software on its own devices connected exclusively to its global peer-to-peer network - but that he would consider offering that via partnership.

201204,UPDATE 6-Microsoft eyes tablet lift via Barnes & Noble deal,"* Microsoft to invest in new B&N digital, college unit * Deal values new business at $1.7 bln * Microsoft will own 17.6 pct of new subsidiary * Barnes & Noble shares end up 52 pct; Microsoft stock flat (Adds financial details, closing share prices) By Phil Wahba and Bill Rigby NEW YORK/SEATTLE, April 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is jumping into the fast-growing e-books market by investing $605 million over five years in Barnes & Noble Inc's Nook e-reader and college business, as it looks to unlock Amazon.com and Apple Inc's grip on the exploding tablet computer market. The move comes just six months before the world's largest software maker is due to launch its new touch-enabled Windows 8 operating system, and the inclusion of a Nook app on Windows tablets should allow them to compete with Apple's iPad and Amazon's Kindle Fire. It also gives Microsoft a direct interest in electronic publishing just as the market for downloadable college textbooks starts to take off and the publishing industry undergoes a radical shift toward electronic distribution. ""It's a good strategic deal,"" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. ""It gets Microsoft in the game for e-readers, and gives them access to a market that has been growing nicely and they've basically sat out of. It also makes Windows 8 a more compelling platform from an e-readers perspective."" In turn, Barnes & Noble gets a much-needed capital injection and a way to enter the digital books market outside the United States. The new unit will be run and majority owned by Barnes & Noble and will maintain a relationship with the U.S. bookstore chain's nearly 700 stores. Shares of Barnes & Noble soared as much as 90 percent in early trading, before sliding back and ending with a 52 percent gain at $20.75. Microsoft shares, which recently hit a four-year high, edged up 0.1 percent to close at $32.015. Microsoft's initial investment of $300 million, which will give it a 17.6 percent stake in the newly created Barnes & Noble subsidiary, values the new unit at $1.7 billion. Over the next five years, Microsoft has committed to invest another $305 million. The deal - initially worth only 0.5 percent of Microsoft's cash hoard - is financially small, but strategically important for both companies. Microsoft's Windows software still runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, but the company has been left behind in the mobile revolution as millions of people do more computing on smartphones and tablets running Apple or Google's Android software. Microsoft has also struggled to make its mark on internet-based commerce, which is dominated by Amazon, or rival Apple and Google's online app stores. ""The deal brings Microsoft technology and engineers into the Nook business - that talent will be tapped to make the Nook even better,"" said Albert Greco, a book industry expert at the business school of Fordham University in New York. ""It gives Microsoft a tablet already, and Barnes & Noble global reach for the Nook platform, through Windows 8."" Barnes & Noble Chief Executive William Lynch told Reuters that the investment would go primarily to fund the international rollout of the Nook's digital bookstores and new reading software for the Windows platform. MICROSOFT BACKS ANDROID Under the deal announced early on Monday, Microsoft will get a 17.6 percent stake in a new Barnes & Noble unit combining the bookseller's college bookstore and Nook businesses. Those areas made up just over $1 billion in sales last quarter, about 40 percent of Barnes & Noble's total. Microsoft, which will get an unspecified share of the new unit's sales, will pay $25 million a year for the first five years to help with development costs and acquiring content, and will make an upfront payment of $60 million a year for the first three years after the launch of Windows 8, essentially guaranteeing minimum sales of that amount to Barnes & Noble. That means Microsoft's total outlay will be at least $605 million. As part of the deal, Microsoft has dropped a patent lawsuit against Barnes & Noble over the Nook, which runs on Google's Android system, and will get royalties on those patents. There is a possibility that future Nook models will be based on the Windows operating system, but executives would not comment on that in a call with analysts. Barnes & Noble gets a much-needed capital injection and a way to enter the digital books market outside the United States. The new unit will be run by Barnes & Noble and will maintain a relationship with the U.S. bookstore chain's nearly 700 stores. Barnes & Noble's Nook has found a strong following, allowing it to garner some 27 percent of the U.S. e-books market in the 2-1/2 years since the device was launched, compared with Amazon's 60 percent and Apple's 10 percent. But battling Amazon's market-leading Kindle has proved expensive. ""It gives them a much larger partner with deeper pockets, it gives them increased reach,"" said Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom. ""In the last two years they've had their backs against the wall."" Last year, Barnes & Noble suspended its dividend to direct more cash into developing Nook, which resulted in a well-reviewed glow in the dark Nook introduced last month. In January, however, it lowered its sales and profit forecasts as it faces pressure from Amazon's aggressive pricing strategy which has prompted it repeatedly to lower the prices on its own devices. NOOK TO GO GLOBAL Barnes & Noble has poured tens of millions of dollars into developing the Nook. The first version hit the market in 2009, two years after the Kindle. The company's e-readers, tablets and electronic book sales have helped it offset a broader decline in book sales. Same-store sales of books at its brick-and-mortar stores have edged up again largely thanks to the bankruptcy last year of Borders Group. But the Nook has been available only in the United States and the company said last year it wanted to take its digital business to new markets. Lynch told Reuters that deals to sell Nook through retailers abroad were ""coming soon."" Barnes & Noble said in January that it might spin off its digital business, which includes the Nook, arguing that investors were not giving the company enough credit for that growth. The company did not say on Monday if it would take the new venture public. Barnes & Noble put itself up for sale in 2010 but attracted only one firm offer - a bid for $17 per share, or $1 billion, last May, from Liberty Media, which was drawn by the Nook's growth. Liberty ultimately decided to invest $204 million rather than buy the company outright. It now has preferred shares it can convert into a 16.6 percent stake in Barnes & Noble at a strike price of $17.

201204,Social gifting: the new buzzword in e-commerce,"* Sweden's Wrapp, other startups, win venture-cap backing * Nascent industry carries big growth potential -investors * Retailers like potential sales boost, low marketing cost By Nivedita Bhattacharjee April 30 (Reuters) - Last year, the buzzword in e-commerce was Groupon Inc and its myriad of competitors that offered daily online coupons to entice shoppers in a down economy. Now, the latest fashion in retail is social gifting, where people get together on Facebook to buy each other gifts. Start-ups such as Sweden-based Wrapp, which is launching its U.S. business on Monday, are getting millions of dollars in venture-capital funding, and retailers like Best Buy Co Inc , Gap Inc and Starbucks Corp are scurrying to be a part of it. ""Brick-and-mortar retailers are all looking for new, more efficient ways to drive sales into stores without diluting their brands ... we wanted to really see how retailers can leverage the megatrends of smartphones and social networks,"" said Hjalmar Winbladh, chief executive of Wrapp. Wrapp is essentially an app that can run on smartphones, tablets and computers. It allows Facebook friends to buy each other gift cards from participating retailers either individually or by teaming up, which they can store on their mobile devices and redeem either online or inside physical stores. Retailers like it because there is little marketing cost and because customers often end up buying more once they are inside the store. Since mid-November more than 165,000 active users have given over 1.4 million gift cards that can be redeemed in some 50 major retail stores across Europe, according to Wrapp. ""The thing that struck me as unique and interesting about Wrapp is that it is kind of the intersection of three trends: gift cards, social networks and mobile (shopping),"" said Reid Hoffman, a cofounder of LinkedIn and a partner at Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. Wrapp has received $10.5 million in funding from Greylock and technology VC firm Atomico. Hoffman serves on Wrapp's board, as does Skype co-founder and Atomico founder Niklas Zennström. In the United States, the Swedish company has tied up with retailers including H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB, Gap Inc , Sephora and Fab. E-gifting - or people buying gift cards from a retailer's website - is still in its infancy, accounting for only $1 billion of the $100 billion gift card industry last year, according to Brian Riley, senior research director at CEB TowerGroup.

201204,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel Corp. cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Jan. 23: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Jan. 24: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Jan. 25: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. predicts it will start the new year with a surprisingly strong quarter. The outlook helps assure investors that LSI is past the problems caused by the hard disk shortages, which had threatened to have ripple effects on LSI's semiconductors for data storage and networking. Jan. 26: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. Marvell Technology lowers its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, citing Thailand flooding and weak year-end demand among mobile and wireless customers. Emulex Corp., a maker of data storage and network equipment, says it was able to restore full production capacity at a cost of $2.1 million, reducing gross margins during the latest quarter. Feb. 7: Emerson Electric says its net income fell 23 percent as the diversified manufacturing and technology company saw costs rise and sales take a hit from flooding in Thailand. Flooding caused supply chain disruptions that hurt results at Emerson's process management division and to a lesser extent at its network power business, delaying about $300 million in sales, most of which are expected to be recovered this year. Feb. 9: Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's second-biggest maker of PCs, says a global shortage caused by flooding is adding $5 to $10 to the cost of each hard drive. Chief Financial Officer Wong Waiming says the impact of the floods on hard drive production will ""likely continue to affect global PC supply"" into the next quarter and hard drive costs ""will continue to stay high in the short term."" Feb. 22: Hewlett Packard Co. blames flooding for more than half of its drop in revenue, a 7 percent decline to $30 billion. HP says it decided to divert supplies of drives to higher-margin products. It expects constraints to continue in the quarter through April, but the effect on revenue should be smaller compared with the recent quarter. March 29: Data storage provider Xyratex Ltd. says its net income in the latest quarter more than doubled, despite flooding in Thailand hindering its ability to meet customer needs. Xyratex, based in England, had warned that it may have trouble meeting its customer's storage demands because of a limited supply of certain disk drives. April 11: Estimates from Gartner and IDC suggest that PC manufacturers have mitigated hard drive supply constraints. Gartner says there were moderate problems in selected markets, such as low-end consumer laptops, but ""low PC demand was able to mask the tight (hard drive) supply overall."" IDC says larger PC makers such as HP and Dell succeeded in managing inventory and absorbing price increases in the parts. April 17: Intel's results for the first quarter were held back by the hard-drive shortage. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology, a hard-drive maker, says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. April 26: Hard-drive maker Western Digital Corp. says the company and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,"A look at how selected chipmakers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: April 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC estimate that PC shipments in the first quarter were ahead of their expectations, though growth was modest in light of competition from smartphones and tablet computers. Hewlett-Packard Co. appeared to have regained some of the business it had lost as it was weighing whether to dump its PC business. Lenovo Group Ltd. showed strong gains over last year. Dell Inc.'s market share fell as it focused on higher-end, higher-profit machines. April 17: IBM Corp. reports flat revenue, falling short of analysts' expectations. Software and services revenue grew, but IBM's hardware and financing segments saw a decline. Intel Corp. reports first-quarter results that were held back by a shortage of hard drives, which meant that PC makers had to curb production and needed fewer Intel chips. The scarcity was caused by flooding of hard-drive factories in Thailand last year. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology PLC reports that its earnings in the latest quarter surged and revenue almost doubled. CEO Steve Luczo says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. But Seagate says it also shifted its product line to ""industry-leading products"" across all of its markets. April 18: Strong demand boosted revenue at Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs says the company benefited from growing global demand for new 3G- and 4G-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. But he says the cost of making more 28 nanometer chips could cut into profit margins in upcoming months. April 19: Microsoft Corp. reports a surprise rise in sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers. Analysts had assumed that many businesses and consumers thinking about buying a PC would hold off until Windows 8 hits the market in the fall. That didn't turn out to be the case as revenue in the Windows division increased 4 percent in the latest quarter. EMC Corp., one of the world's largest makers of data-storage computers, says first-quarter earnings jumped 23 percent, boosted by increased demand for its cloud computing products. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. says its computing solutions unit had flat revenue, while the graphics segment saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue because of lower demand for desktop and mobile graphics. SanDisk Corp., a maker of flash memory, says quarterly earnings sank by almost half amid weak demand and low selling prices -- trends the company expects will continue in the current quarter. The company says it expects demand to rise, but not until the second half of 2012. Altera Corp., a semiconductor maker, reports weak results it attributes to lighter-than-expected demand for its products, particularly from customers in the communications industry. In addition, the company said it had some issues trying to fill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. The company expects its business to rebound in the second quarter and says its backlog has significantly improved since the end of the quarter on stronger demand for its products. April 23: Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. says the business cycle ""bottomed"" in the first quarter. Orders rose 13 percent. CEO Rich Templeton says 2012 will be ""a good year for growth."" Xerox Corp. says revenue from its services business grew, while technology revenue, such as sales of document systems and supplies, declined. Services now make up more than half the company's revenue. April 24: Apple Inc.'s Mac sales for the quarter came in slightly below expectations, at 4 million. But Apple once again reported blowout iPhone sales, along with iPad sales that were two and a half times what it sold a year earlier. The relative strength of iPhone sales means they accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent. April 25: Business software maker SAP AG says net income rose 10 percent in the first quarter. It cited strong sales momentum for its high-speed HANA data platform and cloud-computing acquisition SuccessFactors. April 26: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which supplies chips under contract for other companies including Apple, predicts ""solid growth"" with stronger-than-anticipated demand for smartphones and tablet computers coming from the U.S. and China. Western Digital Corp., a leading maker of hard drives, says production is heading back up. That led to a drop in its stock price, as a bigger supply could lead to lower prices. CEO John Coyne says Western Digital and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods that hit factories in Thailand last year. They had led to industrywide shortages of hard drives.

Nokia Corp. says sales of smartphones dropped to 12 million in the first quarter, from 24 million a year earlier, while volume sales of cellphones fell to 83 million from 108 million a year earlier. April 24: Apple Inc. says it sold 35 million iPhones in the quarter, almost twice as many as it sold a year ago and above analyst expectations. IPad sales came in below analyst expectations, at 11.8 million units. But that was still two and a half times as many as it sold in the same quarter a year ago. Mac sales were also slightly below expectations, at 4 million. That was 7 percent more than a year ago. Apple sold 7.7 million iPods, down 15 percent from a year earlier. AT&T Inc. says it activated 4.3 million iPhones in the first quarter. That was down from 7.6 million in the fourth quarter, when AT&T began selling the iPhone 4S. However, the number was still up from the 3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold in the same quarter a year ago. HTC Corp. reports a drop in first-quarter earnings and revenue as it faces competition from Apple and Samsung, but it expects revenue to rise in the current quarter with its ""HTC One"" series phone that offers users a better camera and music experience in addition to a sleek design.

201204,"Folk artist's garden enjoying renaissance as supporters plan for preservation, celebration","PENNVILLE, Ga. (AP) - The Rev. Howard Finster is still helping call the roll up yonder, but in a development virtually no one expected, his Paradise Garden is springing back to life. Tucked away in this quiet corner of northwest Georgia, the wild 2.5-acre plot that Finster began assembling in 1961 out of an inexhaustible creative impulse and other people's castoffs had been in a slow fade since he went to be with the angels a decade ago. But things are suddenly moving again at the visionary art environment that many considered the greatest expression of the famed fire-and-brimstone preacher-turned-artist's peculiar genius. In December, Chattooga County, with $125,000 in Appalachian Regional Commission grant money and private donations, purchased the swampy parcel from a group that had struggled to maintain and keep it open. Formed in January, the nonprofit Paradise Garden Foundation Inc. signed a 50-year lease with the county and assumed day-to-day management. This month, the garden was added to the National Register of Historic Places, an affirmation of credibility that should help make preservation grants from governmental and foundation sources flow in its direction. A site management plan that will guide what's expected to be an extensive and expensive multiyear restoration of Finster's fragile art environment is due in May from the Atlanta architecture firm Lord Aeck & Sargent. But even ahead of that, work to make the property presentable for Finster Fest, the annual fiesta of self-taught art and rock music being presented next weekend, is going full tilt. One recent weekday, volunteers from Home Depot's corporate headquarters in Cobb County were planting flowers, cleaning crusty windows and sweeping mud and leaves off walkways studded with Finster's glistening mosaic art. It's symbolic that blockages in the serpentine creek that lends the low-lying parcel a portion of its mystique, along with plenty of unwelcome murk, have been shoveled out and the water is flowing once again. Paradise Garden Foundation is billing the fest, held at downtown Summerville's Dowdy Park with free shuttles regularly delivering guests to the garden two miles away, as a ""grand reopening."" In truth, the garden never officially closed, but it was open only sporadically last year, drawing 2,000 visitors. But Chattooga County and foundation officials are counting on many times that in years to come. In fact, the garden is at the heart of a plan to boost heritage tourism to one of Georgia's poorest counties and to help re-energize downtown Summerville's reviving but still snoozy Main Street. That sounds like a lot of expectation to be borne by a hand-built attraction that was showing the toll of erosion, weather and general deterioration for at least a decade before the increasingly frail Finster died at age 84 in 2001. After all, it was included on the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation's Places in Peril list but two years ago. But 32-year-old Jason Winters, the county's sole commissioner, who grew up in the tiny Chattooga town of Lyerly and recalls visiting Paradise Garden as a youngster, said the site remains well-known across the country and is capable of inspiring new generations. ""So many small communities would love to have the promotional tool that we've got,"" he said of Paradise Garden. ""We're just now beginning to be able to tap that resource."" Winters wants to ""capture"" more travelers between Atlanta and Nashville, who cut through downtown Summerville on U.S. 27 to get to I-75 or I-59. He also hopes to boost overnight visitation to the area, which also boasts James H. ""Sloppy"" Floyd State Park and popular annual events such as autumn's Steam Into Summerville Railroad Days. He can already point to positive developments in response to the promise of the garden's revival: Vision Gallery, a storefront filled with locally made art and crafts with a name inspired by Finster (who was known as the Man of Visions) opened in March downtown; and Folk America, a gallery focusing on 20th-century self-taught artists, is opening a mile north of town next weekend in time to tap into Finster Fest crowds. Larry Schlachter, who is converting a long-empty 1935 red-brick farmhouse into the slick, dramatically lit, 1,500-square-foot gallery, said the sale of Paradise Garden to the county is what encouraged him and his wife, Jane, to proceed post-haste toward realizing a long-held dream. ""It's the first real chance the garden has had since Howard passed,"" said Schlachter, a longtime Finster friend and patron who also operates Trade Days, a twice-weekly flea market on a lot next to his new gallery where everything from live chickens to fresh produce to old Nintendo games are sold. ""It was just sad. It just passed along with Howard. You know, Howard was the garden."" Certainly, Paradise Garden was an expression of everything Finster was about. A sign he hand-lettered once greeted visitors and gave context to the overflowing eyefuls they were about to encounter: ""I took the pieces you threw away -- put them togather (sic) night and day. Washed by rain, dried by sun, a million pieces all in one."" But then this self-proclaimed ""second Noah,"" who for decades had lived in various structures around the periphery of the property while continuing to assemble the garden, moved to what he called an ""executive branch"" neighborhood near downtown Summerville in the early 1990s. With the pontiff of Paradise no longer holding court at the garden as often, at least one family member was believed to have sold off concrete sculptures, painted wood cutouts and other parts of the permanent installations behind the artist's back. That provoked Finster, increasingly concerned about what would happen after his death, to sell even more to Jimmy Allen, a former Atlanta ""picker."" In turn, Allen dealt them to private collectors and the High Museum of Art, which crafted a permanent gallery for its major Paradise Garden acquisitions, including the concrete sculpture ""The Calves and the Young Lion."" ""I'd like for Paradise Garden to live on so that people can enjoy it, but visitors have sorrow in the heart when they see it going down,"" Finster lamented in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2000. ""It's a hard thing to bear. ... I thought it'd go on forever."" In an effort to hold on to what remained, his daughter Beverly Finster took over management of the grounds and a gallery/gift shop perched at a different entrance, fenced the parcel and started charging admission to pay for maintenance. ""It took my daddy 35 years to build this place, and it might take me 35 years to restore it,"" she told the AJC in 2000. By 2007, she'd had enough and sold Paradise Garden to the Rev. Tommy Littleton, a preacher and real estate investor from Birmingham and a board member of the nonprofit she had started. In a recent interview, Beverly Finster described running it as an energy zapper and bank account drain. The biggest challenge, she said, was ""trying to get something fixed before something else tore up. I call it the money pit."" Littleton was challenged, as well. Seeking restoration funds, he was turned down by 35 foundations, he told The New York Times later in 2007. ""That's been one of our struggles,"" he said, ""to get a major entity to believe in the project and fund it."" Paradise Garden Foundation executive director Jordan Poole, while careful to praise Littleton's nonprofit for work that included emergency repairs to the most significant structure Finster built, the wedding cake-shaped World's Folk Art Church, says the Alabama man and his out-of-town board were viewed as outsiders in this rural enclave. ""There was definitely some problems with getting a local buy-in because he didn't have that local connection going,"" Poole said. Leading the new charge, Poole is a 1996 Chattooga High School graduate with two historic preservation degrees from the Savannah College of Art and Design. He has worked as restoration manager at Mount Vernon, George Washington's house museum in Virginia, as well as for the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation. ""It's one of those things where you can talk the talk and walk the walk when you're from a place,"" said Poole, 28. Still, one question that a lot of Finster followers have wondered since the artist's death is how much remains at Paradise Garden worth talking about. Jack Pyburn, the Lord Aeck & Sargent principal heading the site management plan team, estimated that less than 100 of Finster's most notable environmental artworks have survived from as many as 500 that were displayed in the garden's heyday. Nonetheless, after a recent visit, High Museum of Art folk art curator Susan Crawley said, ""I was pleasantly surprised to find how much of Paradise Garden is left. All the major structures are still there, as are a number?of the installation pieces."" Paradise Garden Foundation president Janet Byington noted that Littleton passed along several hundred more items, some admittedly in far from pristine condition, now safely in a Rome storage facility, and that worthy discoveries are a frequent occurrence at the garden. ""Oh, there is so much here and we find things every single day,"" said Byington, district director for U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey. ""You find Howard everywhere. And with modern media today, we can re-create Howard here."" Though the board does not have the Lord Aeck & Sargent plan in hand yet, that indeed seems to be part of the strategy. At the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training's inaugural ""Divine Disorder"" conference held in Louisiana in February and which focused on the conservation of folk art environments, Pyburn suggested it was more important to evoke Finster's feisty, evangelical spirit than it was to try to replace works that are unlikely to be returned. ""My feeling is the most meaningful this site will ever be is as it is today, because it's got what's left of Howard,"" he said. ""Everything else will be an intervention. ... It's about, to me, how you recapture his spirit."" Pyburn and foundation leaders have discussed various ways to make that happen, including videos and audio in the welcome center that once served as Finster's gallery and Smartphone QR codes at stops on tours of the grounds, providing up-to-date information on missing pieces. Byington estimates preservation and interpretation will cost several hundred thousand dollars to start with. She said she is confident the money could be raised through additional grants and community donations. ""I think about how little money Howard had to do things here, and feel we, too, can do it with very little,"" the board president said. ""We're not planning on making this into Disney World or Dollywood. We want you to come here and experience it like Howard (did) because we don't think there's anything like it in the South."" ------ Information from: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, http://www.ajc.com 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,"Microsoft takes $300M stake in Barnes & Noble college, digital businesses; to set up new co.","NEW YORK (AP) - Books and bits united Monday as Microsoft provided an infusion of money to help Barnes & Noble compete with top electronic bookseller Amazon. In exchange, Microsoft gets a long-desired foothold in the business of e-books and college textbooks. With Microsoft Corp.'s $300 million investment, the two companies are teaming up to create a subsidiary for Barnes & Noble's e-book and college textbook businesses. Microsoft is taking a 17.6 percent stake in the venture. The agreement underscores the importance of electronic bookstores as traditional booksellers and technology companies jockey for position in the increasingly competitive market. While no definitive numbers exist, e-books are believed to account for some 20 percent of book sales in the U.S. For Microsoft, the investment is a way to get back into the e-book business. It has dabbled in the field since at least 2000, but never developed much traction. It was Amazon that blew the market open with the 2007 launch of the Kindle, creating a potent challenge to Barnes & Noble's brick-and-mortar bookstores. Major Microsoft competitors Apple and Google now have their own e-book stores. All three companies are building businesses that encompass hardware, software and content in an ""ecosystem,"" and e-books and readers are part of the puzzle. With that perspective, the deal is very important, said Walter Pritchard, an analyst with Citigroup. But he doesn't expect any near-term financial impact from the deal, noting that even if the Microsoft-Barnes & Noble venture is successful, it leaves the Nook a distant second in the e-reader market, behind the Kindle. The deal gives Barnes & Noble ammunition to fend off shareholders who have agitated for a sale of the Nook e-book business or the whole company, but the companies said Monday that they are exploring separating the subsidiary, provisionally dubbed ""Newco,"" entirely from Barnes & Noble. That could mean a stock offering, sale or other deal. The deal also puts to rest concerns that Barnes & Noble doesn't have the capital to compete in the e-book business with market leader Amazon.com Inc. and its Kindle, said analyst David Strasser at Janney Capital. Barnes & Noble Inc.'s stock zoomed up $7.07, or 52 percent, to close trading at $20.75. The opening price of $26 was a three-year high. Microsoft's stock rose 4 cents to $32. The investment also means that Microsoft will own part of a company that sells tablet computers based on Google Inc.'s Android, one of the main competitors of Windows Phone 7, Microsoft's smartphone software. Microsoft also said the deal means that there will be a Nook application for Windows 8 tablets, set to be released this fall. The app is likely to get a favored position on Windows 8 screens. There's already a Nook application for Windows PCs, but none for Windows phones. William Lynch, the CEO of Barnes & Noble, said Nook software will continue to be available on devices like the iPhone that compete with Windows Phone. He declined to say whether it was Barnes & Noble or Microsoft that initiated the discussions, but he said the talks had been going on since before the beginning of the year. ""We have been circling the relationship for quite a long time,"" added Microsoft president Andy Lees. ""When you think of different types of reading and what's going to happen when that goes digital, it's really quite dramatic to be bringing that to Windows customers."" The Nook has pleasantly surprised publishers, who worry about Amazon's domination of the e-market. Unveiled to skeptical reviews in 2009, the Nook is estimated to account for about 25 percent of the U.S. e-book market. The Nook helped to cut Amazon's share from what was believed to be 90 percent to around 60-65 percent. David Pogue in The New York Times called the initial device ""an anesthetized slug,"" but praised the new Nook Simple Touch as a ""very big deal"" that offers ""spectacular, crisp pages to read in any light."" Barnes & Noble investors have also been concerned about the recent government lawsuit against Apple and some leading publishers over alleged price fixing. When Apple launched its iPad in 2010, Simon & Schuster, Penguin Group (USA) and other publishers switched to an ""agency"" model that allowed publishers to set prices for e-books, a system many believe helped Barnes & Noble. Amazon had been offering top-selling e-books for $9.99, a cost publishers, agents and writers believed was so low it could drive competitors out of business. Three of the five publishers sued-- Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins and the Hachette Book Group -- have already agreed to settle, meaning prices for their e-books likely will again drop on Amazon. Microsoft has a long-standing interest in the e-book field. It launched e-book software in 2000, but was never able to build a substantial library of books. It's discontinuing the software on Aug. 30. Barnes & Noble, based in New York, currently runs 691 bookstores in 50 states. The companies said that the subsidiary will have an ongoing relationship with Barnes & Noble's retail stores, but what that relationship will be is unclear. ""The whole reason the Nook business is expanding so rapidly is because bookstores are committed to it and know how to market the product in that environment,"" said Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba information. The possibility of a separation of Barnes & Noble's digital and college businesses has been brewing. In January, Barnes & Noble said it was considering options for its Nook business, including possibly spinning it off or expanding overseas, and said it expected the review to be complete by the end of the year. And in March, private investment firm G Asset Management, a Barnes & Noble shareholder, offered $460 million for a 51 percent stake in the company's college bookstore unit, Barnes & Noble College Booksellers LLC. Under that plan, the college bookstore unit was proposed to begin as a private business but become public within a ""reasonable"" amount of time. G Asset's offer was contingent upon Barnes & Noble keeping current management in place and separating its Nook e-business from the rest of the company. At the time the offer was made, Barnes & Noble declined to comment. In 2009, Barnes & Noble Inc. bought the college bookstore unit from Chairman Leonard Riggio in a deal worth $596 million. The deal ended up costing Barnes & Noble $460 million after accounting for the unit's cash on hand at the closing date. ------ AP Retail Writer Mae Anderson, Business Writer Michelle Chapman and AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report. 5 Press Association, Inc.

201204,Taiwan lowers 2012 economic growth forecast to 3.4 percent amid weak overseas demand,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Taiwan's government on Monday lowered its economic growth forecast for 2012 to 3.4 percent from 3.8 percent as demand fades for the island's mainstay electronic exports. Hit by weaker demand from China, Europe and the U.S., Taiwan's export-reliant economy grew only 0.4 percent in the January-March quarter, falling short of the 1.2 percent forecast in February, the government said. Taiwan's economy is expected to sustain relatively healthy growth throughout the year, with the global economy set to stage a steady, albeit slow recovery, said the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. In the January-March quarter, Taiwanese exports fell 4 percent to $70 billion, but exports are expected to grow 4.3 percent for the entire year to $320 billion, the agency said. Taiwan's mainstay electronics industry could slow under keener competition from global brands such as Apple Inc. but a robust recovery in the semiconductor sector and brisk sales of smartphones could partially offset the slowdown, the agency said. Exports to mainland China and Hong Kong tumbled 9.7 percent during the first quarter, the sharpest plunge of all the island's export markets. But exports to Southeast Asia countries grew 7.7 percent. Low wages there are attracting more foreign investment and prompting increased imports of raw materials and components. For the whole of 2012, Taiwan's inflation is expected to reach 1.9 percent, up from the earlier forecast of 1.5, following fuel and utilities rate hikes, the agency said. The jobless rate will increase slightly to 4.2 percent for the year, it said. Taiwan's economy grew a robust 10.7 percent in 2010 but growth slowed to 4 percent in 2011. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,Last Chance for Nokia to Deliver a Game-Changer,"Nokia Corp. is staring into the abyss, but some reckon it may have just enough time left to arrest a terminal decline. In February 2011, Chief Executive Stephen Elop suggested in an internal memo that the company was standing on a ""burning platform"" and must ""change its behavior."" Little the mobile-phone maker has done since has persuaded analysts and investors that Nokia can regain its former glory. In fact, there have been mutterings about whether the mobile giant can survive at all, given a steep fall in profit and market share over the last 12 months. Nokia declined to comment. Echoing concerns over the Finnish company's financial position, ratings companies Fitch and Standard & Poor's downgraded Nokia's credit ratings to ""junk"" last week. Even with a cash pile of €4.9 billion ($6.5 billion), the company saw its net cash position decline by 24% year over year in the first quarter, as its transition to making Windows-running smartphones is turning out to be increasingly costly. In another blow, Samsung Electronics Co. last week overtook Nokia as the world's largest maker of mobile phones by number of units. Still, Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard said Nokia remains a big player and that its strategic tie-up with Microsoft Corp. bodes well for its survival. ""The combination of Microsoft Corp.'s strong position in the PC-market and Nokia's huge distribution network makes me convinced that there is a reasonably good chance for Nokia's bet on Windows to succeed,"" he said. Moody's Investors Service, the only of the three major ratings firms that has an investment-grade rating for Nokia's credit, said the company could bolster profitability and cash flow in the short term by disposing of noncore businesses and parts of its formidable intellectual-property portfolio. Other market watchers say economies of scale still give Nokia a final shot at turning its fortunes around. ""Looking back historically, there is still a chance for a company to manage a turnaround if its market share is above 10%,"" said Pierre Ferragu at Sanford Bernstein in London. ""While Nokia's market share for smartphones has headed clearly below 10%, its basic-feature phone business still has some 25% of the market, meaning that the company, in theory, is still at a scale where it could stabilize."" Nokia's market share of the global mobile-phone market fell to 22.5% in the first quarter from 30.4% a year earlier, according to industry research firm Strategy Analytics. However, its share of the smartphone market tumbled to 8.2% from 23.5%. Sales of Nokia phones were down 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, and the company's shares have fallen 57% over the past year. Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea in Helsinki, said the company is increasingly looking like an acquisition target, given where its shares are trading. The unforgiving mobile-devices sector has claimed the scalps of other big companies. Investment bank UBS has noted that Alcatel, Royal Philips Electronics N.V., Siemens AG, Palm Inc., Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., Sagem and Ericsson have all sought to make mobile devices—some of them successfully at first—only to have their mobile-device units sold, partnered or closed. Research In Motion Ltd., the company that once popularized mobile email through its BlackBerry devices, is now losing customers to rivals like Apple and Samsung at an accelerating pace. Mr. Ferragu said mobile-phone buyers are subjective in their preferences and it is difficult to turn around views. He said Nokia needs a true game-changing device soon. But even if one puts no value in Nokia's smartphone business, the company still has various assets that are more valuable than the company itself, Mr. Sarkamies said. ""I estimate the value of Nokia's 30,000 patents at between €5 billion and €10 billion,"" he said. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Samsung Up Strongly --- Firm Likely Passes Nokia as Top Cellphone Seller; Profit Surges,"SEOUL -- Soaring sales of smartphones lifted Samsung Electronics Co.'s profit to a record in the first quarter and apparently pushed the South Korean company past Nokia Corp. as the world's biggest cellphone seller. Samsung also may have passed Apple Inc. as the world's top seller of smartphones, though analysts disagreed on that, giving widely varying estimates of Samsung's output. Other cellphone manufacturers disclose unit shipments of their products, but Samsung stopped doing so a year ago. Even so, its overall financial announcement underscored the importance of Samsung's transition to smartphones, which, after a slow start, is now moving faster than the industry average. Samsung on Friday reported first-quarter profit of 5.05 trillion won ($4.45 billion), up 82% jump the year-earlier 2.78 trillion won. Sales rose 22% to 45.27 trillion won. In Samsung's previous record quarter -- the third quarter of 2010 -- three-fourths of its profit of 4.46 trillion won came from its chip business. In this latest period, three-fourths came from cellphones. The smartphone success has provided cover for Samsung's other businesses -- particularly its chip division, long its main source of profits. The chip unit reported an operating-profit margin of 9.5%, the lowest since the second quarter of 2009, and a 13% drop in sales. Executives pointed to a sharp reduction in prices of memory chips, the company's highest-volume product, and lost output due to factory retrofitting. With smartphones yielding more revenue and bigger profit margins than regular cellphones, Samsung's telecommunications unit nearly doubled its revenue and nearly tripled its operating profit compared with a year earlier. The operating-profit margin of Samsung's telecom unit reached 18.4%, the highest level since 2004, and the unit accounted for half of the broader company's sales. On Thursday, Samsung will unveil a new version of its flagship Android-based phone, expected to be called Galaxy S III. ""We expect it to be our most successful smartphone ever,"" Kim Hyun-joon, a vice president in the company's mobile-communications business, said Friday, forecasting it will ""substantially contribute"" to second-quarter results. Samsung's refusal to provide data on cellphone sales, however, makes it unclear precisely how far it has advanced in its transition to smartphones. The issue is likely to concern large investors and financial analysts, whose forecasts for the company's stock performance in recent months have increasingly focused on smartphones. With Samsung the last cellphone maker to report results, market-research firms on Friday hustled out preliminary scoring for the first quarter -- and diverged widely. All appeared to agree that Samsung eclipsed Nokia in cellphone sales to become No. 1 for the first time. Nokia, which has struggled with the smartphone transition, last week reported shipping 82.7 million phones in the quarter, off 24% from a year earlier. However, analysts' estimates of Samsung's winning margin ranged from just 700,000 phones (ABI Research) to about 10 million phones (Strategy Analytics). And in smartphones, Strategy Analytics estimated Samsung beat Apple's reported sales of 35.1 million by about seven million. But others put Samsung still second to Apple, with IHS iSuppli estimating Samsung shipped only 32 million smartphones. Samsung executives made no comments about the company's standing against its rivals. They said in a conference call with analysts that sales were down by a single-digit percentage from the fourth quarter of last year. Adding to the confusion is that the last time Samsung disclosed sales figures, in the fourth quarter of 2010, it mixed tallies of smartphones and tablet personal computers. The next quarter, with its tablet sales looking weak and litigation beginning with Apple over smartphone designs and patents, Samsung stopped providing the figures altogether. Samsung, which has been a top-five maker of cellphones for more than a decade and No. 2 since 2006, entered the smartphone business just two years ago, long after Blackberry maker Research in Motion Inc. and three years after the rollout of Apple's iPhone. It has relied heavily on models built around Google Inc.'s Android software to gain ground. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Profits Don't Always Stick in China's Web,"The only thing growing faster than China's e-commerce sector seems to be the losses of firms burning cash to gain market share.

The 800 pound gorilla in China's e-commerce sector is Alibaba Group, which claimed 72% of the market by transaction value in the final quarter of 2011 through its Taobao and Tmall sites, according to Analysys. Everyone else is playing catch-up. 360buy, which sells everything from consumer electronics to underwear, accounts for just 5% of the market. Amazon, online bookseller Dangdang and Yihaodian—in which Wal-Mart Stores has a stake—languish with less than 1% each. Bricks and mortar electronics retailers Suning and Gome are muscling in as well, and instant messaging company Tencent is using its existing online presence to support its Paipai e-commerce site. With no one specializing in a particular niche, a competitive bloodbath results. Fierce price cutting twinned with high costs for building out distribution networks savage margins. Dangdang's gross margin in the fourth quarter was 10.5%, compared with 22.4% a year earlier. Sean O'Rourke, China e-commerce analyst at RedTech Advisors, thinks aggressive discounting by 360buy means its margins are even lower. Alibaba's third-party sales model, where it collects a fee from vendors, provides some protection from margin pressure. For everybody else, with profitability a distant prospect, deep pockets are required. This works better for some than others. Amazon's strong U.S. business means it could bankroll its Chinese online outfit for a long time. Dangdang, which had a loss in 2011, doesn't have that luxury. In the early days of the Internet the problem was that no one knew how to generate revenue. Now the problem in China is that everybody does. Fierce competition means the only winners so far are consumers. Write to Tom Orlik at Thomas.orlik@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Samsung Takes Cellphone Lead,"SEOUL—Soaring sales of smartphones lifted Samsung Electronics Co.'s profit to a record in the first quarter and apparently pushed the South Korean company past Nokia Corp. as the world's biggest cellphone seller. Samsung may also have passed Apple Inc. as the world's top seller of smartphones, though analysts disagreed on that, giving widely varying estimates of Samsung's output. Other cellphone manufacturers disclose unit shipments of their products, but Samsung stopped doing so a year ago. Even so, its overall financial announcement underscored the importance of Samsung's transition to smartphones, which, after a slow start, is now moving faster than the industry average. Samsung on Friday reported first-quarter profit of 5.05 trillion won ($4.45 billion), up 82% jump the year-earlier 2.78 trillion won. Sales were up 22% to 45.27 trillion won. In Samsung's previous record quarter—the third quarter of 2010—three-fourths of its 4.46 trillion won profit came from its chip business. In this latest period, three-fourths came from cellphones. The smartphone success has provided cover for Samsung's other businesses—particularly its chip division, long its main source of profits. The chip unit reported an operating profit margin of 9.5%, the lowest since the second quarter of 2009, and a 13% drop in sales. Executives pointed to a sharp reduction in prices of memory chips, the company's highest-volume product, and lost output due to factory retrofitting. With smartphones yielding more revenue and bigger profit margins than regular cellphones, Samsung's telecom unit nearly doubled its revenue and nearly tripled its operating profit compared to a year ago. The operating profit margin of Samsung's telecom unit reached 18.4%, the highest level since 2004, and the unit accounted for half of the broader company's sales. On Thursday, Samsung will unveil a new version of its flagship Android-based phone, expected to be called Galaxy S III. ""We expect it to be our most successful smartphone ever,"" Kim Hyun-joon, a vice president in the company's mobile-communications business, said Friday, forecasting it will ""substantially contribute"" to second-quarter results. Samsung's refusal to provide data on cellphone sales, however, makes it unclear precisely how far it has advanced in its transition to smartphones. The issue is likely to concern large investors and financial analysts, whose forecasts for the company's stock performance in recent months have increasingly focused on smartphones. With Samsung the last cellphone maker to report results, market-research firms on Friday hustled out preliminary scoring for the first quarter—and diverged widely. All appeared to agree that Samsung eclipsed Nokia in cellphone sales to become No. 1 for the first time. Nokia, which has struggled with the smartphone transition, last week reported shipping 82.7 million phones in the quarter, 24% less than a year earlier. However, analysts' estimates of Samsung's winning margin ranged from just 700,000 phones (ABI Research) to about 10 million phones (Strategy Analytics). And in smartphones, Strategy Analytics estimated Samsung beat Apple's reported sales of 35.1 million by about seven million. But others put Samsung still second to Apple, with IHS iSuppli estimating Samsung shipped only 32 million smartphones. Samsung executives made no comments about the company's standing against its rivals. They said in a conference call with analysts that sales were down by a single-digit percentage from the fourth quarter of last year. Adding to the confusion is that the last time Samsung disclosed sales figures, in the fourth quarter of 2010, it mixed tallies of smartphones and tablet PCs. The next quarter, with its tablet sales looking weak and litigation beginning with Apple over smartphone designs and patents, Samsung stopped providing the figures altogether. Samsung, which has been a top-five maker of cellphones for more than a decade and No. 2 since 2006, entered the smartphone business just two years ago, long after Blackberry maker Research in Motion Inc. and three years after the rollout of Apple's iPhone. It has relied heavily on models built around Google Inc.'s Android software to gain ground. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,"ANALYSIS-Even in emerging markets, Nokia's star is fading","* In shadow of smartphone revamp, basic phones struggle * Nokia losing share to Samsung, Chinese vendors * Nokia missing cheap full touch models * In China carriers pushing local brands By Devidutta Tripathy and Tarmo Virki NEW DELHI/HELSINKI, April 29 (Reuters) - Nokia phones once took pride of place in Manish Khatri's Mumbai store, but now models made by Samsung Electronics get the limelight. He has nothing against Nokia, he says, but it's better for business to push the more popular models. That simple calculation is being made in thousands of stores across India and similar emerging markets, where Nokia's rivals used to be relative minnows. For 14 years the world's biggest seller of mobile phones, it was overtaken by Korea's Samsung in the first quarter of this year, having already watched both Apple and Samsung leapfrog its lead in the lucrative smartphone segment last year. In the popular narrative of Nokia's eclipse, it is Apple's iPhone that steals the light, but the company is also losing its shine in the basic phone market, which had been a reliable generator of profits and carried the promise of years of strong growth in emerging markets. No more. Its basic phone sales fell 16 percent in the first three months of 2012, and have fallen in four of the last five quarters, while competitors like China's ZTE and Huawei have been growing fast. In India, the world's second-biggest mobile phone market, with more than 900 million subscribers, Nokia's market share has halved in the three years to 2011, when it sold 31 percent of the total 183 million handsets sold, according to Indian researcher CyberMedia. Analysts say it has failed to keep up with the changing tastes of the growing middle class, and, in a country where the thin-margin network operators don't tend to subsidise phones, is losing storeowners like Khatri, who influence buyers' choices. ""For dealers like us, we face a lot of problems from Nokia for getting even the basic (demonstration phone) dummies to show to the customer,"" he said. ""There is no push from the company."" He said his store, which sells around 500 phones a month, is probably not a priority for Nokia, but Samsung has been sending staff to visit. LOCAL FAVOURITES In China, the world's largest cellphone market, operators have started to play a bigger role in selling phones, and that trend is working against Nokia. ""They prioritise domestic vendors over international companies,"" said analyst Pete Cunningham from Canalys. In January-March its sales there shrank 62 percent from a year ago. Its share of the market had dwindled to 24 percent last year from 39 percent two years earlier, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. In Africa, too, its market share slipped to 51 percent last year from 62 percent two years before. It's still ahead of rivals because of its superior distribution on the continent, says Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics, but it has to act to arrest the decline. ""Nokia is drying up like a puddle in the sun and urgently needs new products to refill the puddle,"" he said. In the meantime, it is racking up losses, its shares have lost more than three quarters of their value in a year, and this week two agencies cut its credit rating to junk status. Nokia says it is continuing to invest to attract customers in these markets. ""Our mobile phones portfolio continues to be strong, especially in key markets like India, Nigeria, Brazil and Mexico where the Asha products are receiving record high scores from consumers,"" said Mary McDowell, EVP Mobile Phones. She said the company would be announcing data plans for the new Asha 202 basic phone model with five operators in India on Monday. MISSING TOUCH Analysts also say Nokia can be slow to react on popular technology. In emerging markets, for example, multi-SIM models have been a draw for people who want to take advantage of freebies doled out by competing carriers, but Nokia lacked such phones until mid-2011. Another costly gap in its basic phones offering is a full touch-screen model. Around 105 million such phones were sold last year globally, according to Strategy Analytics. ""Nokia left the door wide open for Samsung and others by not delivering a full-touch feature phone. The Koreans figured it out three years ago, yet Nokia still does not have a product,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. ""In the meantime, prices of Android smartphones have dropped, and Nokia's window of opportunity is almost closed."" Nokia is due to unveil a full-touch 306 feature phone model in the coming months. SLIPPED HALO ""Nokia's main challenge this year is to arrest the sharp decline in its flagship smartphone portfolio and use it to rebuild a positive halo-effect for the overall Nokia brand,"" said Mawston. The company abandoned its own Symbian smartphone operating system last year in favour of the largely untried Windows Phone alternative after Stephen Elop joined as chief executive from Windows maker Microsoft. Symbian sales have nosedived before the Windows models got off the ground. This month it started sales of the first Windows smartphones in China with an aggressive marketing campaign and huge ads at subway stations, in magazines and newspapers. There are some positive noises coming from customers. ""I just bought a new Nokia Windows phone and wasn't very used to its tile design, but the experience was quite good after half an hour. All the basic functions I need are there, and I'm beginning to think that Windows phones will make it,"" Wang Xiao said on his Sina microblog. ""Having an operating system which is Windows-based doesn't excite me,"" said 22-year old student Akshay Johar in New Delhi, looking at one of Nokia's new Lumia models, but added: ""The phone has great features, it looks good, the touch screen is very responsive."" He is considering buying one, he said. About 27 million people need to make that decision this year, 55 million next year, and 94 million in 2014, according to analysts polled by Reuters. That only 2 million did in the first quarter shows how steep is the mountain that Nokia must climb.

201204,People’s Choice Returns With Apps and Adele,"AS a car-buying choice, the Toyota Camry is like the “ask the audience” lifeline on “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” The Camry, the best-selling car in America for 13 of the last 14 years, represents the wisdom of the crowd, a safe harbor for those who just aren’t that interested in cars. Driving a Camry is akin to eating at a chain restaurant, drinking a Bud Light and watching the latest summer blockbuster. Sometimes you simply want to put your money on the known quantity without thinking too much about it. And yet, just as beer snobs will try to foist their home-brew upon the contented light-beer drinker, I feel the quixotic urge to enlighten the Camry-driving masses to their more flavorful options. People, have you seen the new Ford Fusion? It looks like an Aston Martin. How about a Kia Optima with a turbocharged engine and a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty? Are you aware of the Volkswagen Passat diesel? Off the top of my head, all three cars are more intriguing than the Camry. And yet, if there are so many other interesting choices, why is the Camry such a consistent sales monster? The answer, as far as I can tell, is that the Camry excels at providing a soothing luxury experience for a moderate price. In fact, Toyota ruthlessly dropped prices for the redesigned 2012 models. The top-of-the-range 4-cylinder XLE starts at $25,535, almost $2,000 less than the 2011 price. The LE Hybrid, which now returns a combined federal fuel economy rating of 41 m.p.g., starts at $26,750. The most expensive model, the V6 XLE, barely nudges over $30,000. And those prices include two years of free maintenance. Toyota managed to lower sticker prices in the midst of a redesign by postponing the expensive mechanical upgrades that define the competition: you’ll not find direct fuel injection, turbochargers or a diesel engine in the Camry lineup. The new Camry is much like the old Camry, its edges that much more fanatically buffed and chamfered in pursuit of frictionless competence. I could fill the rest of this review simply enumerating all the places where Toyota added extra sound-deadening material. (But I won’t.) And certainly, the Camry’s stolid serenity implies that it must not be much of a stretch to transform the V-6 model into its Lexus-badged equivalent, the ES 350. But you know the news well is a bit dry when Toyota bothers to mention that “the V-6 features a new, lower oil viscosity.” My apologies if you just fell off your chair. Perhaps the wildest change lies not under the hood, but in the dashboard, where Toyota offers its new Entune multimedia system. Entune connects your car to your smartphone, offering Bing, Pandora and other apps through the display screen. I applaud the idea of integrating phones in such a way that they become less dangerous, but I have to wonder if a trick multimedia system is at odds with the demographic of Camry buyers. The segment of Camry drivers who confuse the gas pedal with the brake pedal — per the findings of the unintended acceleration investigation — may well assume that pressing the Apps button causes a tray of jalapeño poppers to slide out of the dashboard. Entune apps are free for three years, after which Toyota figures it will charge $5 a month for apps and another $5 for data. I predict that in three years, there will be a lot of Entune-equipped Camrys with nonfunctional apps because the owners will resent paying a monthly service fee for programs that are free on their phones. Toyota is so keen on apps that it has set up an iCamry Pandora station, which I sampled on my phone after the test drive. Based on that experience, it appears that Adele, whose silky laments dominate iCamry radio, is the musical equivalent of Toyota’s marquee sedan. Given that Adele had the top-selling album last year, I suppose she is sort of the Camry of pop music. I give Toyota credit — it stays on message. If it seems as if I’m spending a lot of time contextualizing, that’s because there’s not a whole lot of news about the driving experience. The 178-horsepower 4-cylinder is reasonably smooth and certainly powerful enough to suit most customers. The chunky four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel feels good in your hands, and the updated dash materials look nice, although the integrated sewn-in-place rear head restraints are an obvious cost-cutting measure. As for all that work reducing the noise quotient, if you told me the Japanese-market Camry were named the Serenity CloudDriver 2.5, I’d believe you. I didn’t sample the V-6, but at a gas station, a Camry driver at an adjacent pump called over and commented on the 4-cylinder XLE that I was fueling. He’d just bought a V-6 version, which he told me was exceedingly rapid. I was surprised — not that the 268-horsepower V-6 is fast, but that Camry drivers talk to one another. I also sampled the Hybrid, which strikes me as the killer deal of the lineup. Toyota says the Camry Hybrid, with 200 combined gas-electric horsepower, does a 0-to-60 sprint in 7.6 seconds, making it faster than the conventional 4-cylinder while returning a fantastic 43 miles per gallon in the Environmental Protection Agency’s city cycle. There’s even an E.V. mode, wherein the driver can rely on the nickel-metal-hydride batteries alone for as much as 1.6 miles. But you’ll need to really tiptoe through the country club to keep the gas engine from firing up, as I discovered when an injudicious throttle foot prompted the gauge cluster to scold me with the message, “E.V. mode deactivated: excessive acceleration.” Let’s just say that the Camry and I have differing ideas about what constitutes excessive acceleration. Across the board, the 2012 Camry offers worthwhile improvements to its predecessor, especially with the price. But at some point Toyota might begin worrying that it’s been optimizing its propellers while everyone else is building jets. The Fusion, for example, will offer lithium batteries for the new hybrids (one of them a plug-in), stop-start systems, direct injection and small-displacement turbocharged motors. None of these features is on the Camry’s horizon anytime soon. Once upon a time, Honda and Toyota had an easy time dominating the midsize sedan market. The Americans were indifferent, the Koreans amateurish, the Germans too expensive. Now Ford and General Motors are going in guns ablaze with the Fusion and Malibu, Hyundai and Kia are raising their game with every redesign and Volkswagen has repositioned the Passat to go after the meat of the market. The Camry enjoys the momentum conferred by the best-seller title, but even disinterested car buyers will eventually punish year-to-year stasis. (See: mid-1990s Ford Taurus.) The Camry’s historic excellence has forced Toyota’s competitors to go back to the drawing board and rethink their strategies. I suspect that sooner rather than later, Toyota will do the same. • INSIDE TRACK: The incumbent champ fights to maintain momentum.

PAGE 18 BOOK REVIEW HOW AMERICA BECAME 'A NATION OF HERETICS' Ross Douthat's ''Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics,'' laments the departure from what he calls ''a Christian center,'' which ''has helped bind together a teeming, diverse and fissiparous nation.'' He argues that Christianity ''provided an invisible mortar for our culture and a common vocabulary for our great debates.'' PAGE 13 'ARE YOU MY MOTHER?' If one is at first glance tempted to dismiss Alison Bechdel's ''Are You My Mother?'' as a glorified comic strip, one would be wildly and woefully misguided: it is as complicated, brainy, inventive and satisfying as the finest prose memoirs.

201204,People's Choice Returns With Apps and Adele,"AS a car-buying choice, the Toyota Camry is like the ''ask the audience'' lifeline on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' The Camry, the best-selling car in America for 13 of the last 14 years, represents the wisdom of the crowd, a safe harbor for those who just aren't that interested in cars. Driving a Camry is akin to eating at a chain restaurant, drinking a Bud Light and watching the latest summer blockbuster. Sometimes you simply want to put your money on the known quantity without thinking too much about it. And yet, just as beer snobs will try to foist their home-brew upon the contented light-beer drinker, I feel the quixotic urge to enlighten the Camry-driving masses to their more flavorful options. People, have you seen the new Ford Fusion? It looks like an Aston Martin. How about a Kia Optima with a turbocharged engine and a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty? Are you aware of the Volkswagen Passat diesel? Off the top of my head, all three cars are more intriguing than the Camry. And yet, if there are so many other interesting choices, why is the Camry such a consistent sales monster? The answer, as far as I can tell, is that the Camry excels at providing a soothing luxury experience for a moderate price. In fact, Toyota ruthlessly dropped prices for the redesigned 2012 models. The top-of-the-range 4-cylinder XLE starts at $25,535, almost $2,000 less than the 2011 price. The LE Hybrid, which now returns a combined federal fuel economy rating of 41 m.p.g., starts at $26,750. The most expensive model, the V6 XLE, barely nudges over $30,000. And those prices include two years of free maintenance. Toyota managed to lower sticker prices in the midst of a redesign by postponing the expensive mechanical upgrades that define the competition: you'll not find direct fuel injection, turbochargers or a diesel engine in the Camry lineup. The new Camry is much like the old Camry, its edges that much more fanatically buffed and chamfered in pursuit of frictionless competence. I could fill the rest of this review simply enumerating all the places where Toyota added extra sound-deadening material. (But I won't.) And certainly, the Camry's stolid serenity implies that it must not be much of a stretch to transform the V-6 model into its Lexus-badged equivalent, the ES 350. But you know the news well is a bit dry when Toyota bothers to mention that ''the V-6 features a new, lower oil viscosity.'' My apologies if you just fell off your chair. Perhaps the wildest change lies not under the hood, but in the dashboard, where Toyota offers its new Entune multimedia system. Entune connects your car to your smartphone, offering Bing, Pandora and other apps through the display screen. I applaud the idea of integrating phones in such a way that they become less dangerous, but I have to wonder if a trick multimedia system is at odds with the demographic of Camry buyers. The segment of Camry drivers who confuse the gas pedal with the brake pedal -- per the findings of the unintended acceleration investigation -- may well assume that pressing the Apps button causes a tray of jalapeno poppers to slide out of the dashboard. Entune apps are free for three years, after which Toyota figures it will charge $5 a month for apps and another $5 for data. I predict that in three years, there will be a lot of Entune-equipped Camrys with nonfunctional apps because the owners will resent paying a monthly service fee for programs that are free on their phones. Toyota is so keen on apps that it has set up an iCamry Pandora station, which I sampled on my phone after the test drive. Based on that experience, it appears that Adele, whose silky laments dominate iCamry radio, is the musical equivalent of Toyota's marquee sedan. Given that Adele had the top-selling album last year, I suppose she is sort of the Camry of pop music. I give Toyota credit -- it stays on message. If it seems as if I'm spending a lot of time contextualizing, that's because there's not a whole lot of news about the driving experience. The 178-horsepower 4-cylinder is reasonably smooth and certainly powerful enough to suit most customers. The chunky four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel feels good in your hands, and the updated dash materials look nice, although the integrated sewn-in-place rear head restraints are an obvious cost-cutting measure. As for all that work reducing the noise quotient, if you told me the Japanese-market Camry were named the Serenity CloudDriver 2.5, I'd believe you. I didn't sample the V-6, but at a gas station, a Camry driver at an adjacent pump called over and commented on the 4-cylinder XLE that I was fueling. He'd just bought a V-6 version, which he told me was exceedingly rapid. I was surprised -- not that the 268-horsepower V-6 is fast, but that Camry drivers talk to one another. I also sampled the Hybrid, which strikes me as the killer deal of the lineup. Toyota says the Camry Hybrid, with 200 combined gas-electric horsepower, does a 0-to-60 sprint in 7.6 seconds, making it faster than the conventional 4-cylinder while returning a fantastic 43 miles per gallon in the Environmental Protection Agency's city cycle. There's even an E.V. mode, wherein the driver can rely on the nickel-metal-hydride batteries alone for as much as 1.6 miles. But you'll need to really tiptoe through the country club to keep the gas engine from firing up, as I discovered when an injudicious throttle foot prompted the gauge cluster to scold me with the message, ''E.V. mode deactivated: excessive acceleration.'' Let's just say that the Camry and I have differing ideas about what constitutes excessive acceleration. Across the board, the 2012 Camry offers worthwhile improvements to its predecessor, especially with the price. But at some point Toyota might begin worrying that it's been optimizing its propellers while everyone else is building jets. The Fusion, for example, will offer lithium batteries for the new hybrids (one of them a plug-in), stop-start systems, direct injection and small-displacement turbocharged motors. None of these features is on the Camry's horizon anytime soon. Once upon a time, Honda and Toyota had an easy time dominating the midsize sedan market. The Americans were indifferent, the Koreans amateurish, the Germans too expensive. Now Ford and General Motors are going in guns ablaze with the Fusion and Malibu, Hyundai and Kia are raising their game with every redesign and Volkswagen has repositioned the Passat to go after the meat of the market. The Camry enjoys the momentum conferred by the best-seller title, but even disinterested car buyers will eventually punish year-to-year stasis. (See: mid-1990s Ford Taurus.) The Camry's historic excellence has forced Toyota's competitors to go back to the drawing board and rethink their strategies. I suspect that sooner rather than later, Toyota will do the same.

201204,S.&P. Downgrades Nokia's Bonds to Junk,"12:27 p.m. UpdatedAdding Nokia's response and information on its earnings. Standard & Poor's downgraded Nokia's bonds on Friday to junk status, noting that the company's first-quarter revenue fell below its expectations, particularly because sales of its phones that include the older Symbian software had fallen so drastically. S.& P.'s announcement came as Samsung dethroned Nokia as the world's No. 1 maker of mobile phones, which includes traditional cellphones and smartphones. Samsung sold 92 million phones over the last quarter, and Nokia sold 83 million, according to estimates by IHS iSuppli, the research firm. It is the first time since 1998 that Nokia is not the No. 1 phone maker in the world. In the smartphone category, Nokia slips to third place behind Apple, the leader with 35 million phones shipped, and Samsung, with 32 million devices, according to iSuppli. In that category, Nokia is slipping faster than Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry. The smartphone segment is the only part of the handset market that is showing any growth. Nokia's long-term rating was dropped to a noninvestment rating, BB+, from the investment-grade rating BBB-, with a negative outlook, S.& P. said. Its short-term rating dropped to B from A-3, S.& P. said. Nokia has been struggling to reverse its declining fortunes with its Lumia smartphones, which include Microsoft's newer operating system, Windows Phone 7. In the United States, AT&T and Nokia have been aggressively promoting the Lumia 900, a $100 smartphone that has been a strong seller on Amazon.com. But even the Lumia phones won't help Nokia recover quickly, S.& P. said. ''We still expect revenue from Lumia smartphones to grow over time but not sufficiently to offset a rapid decline in revenue from Symbian-based smartphones over the next few quarters,'' S.& P. said in a research note. In response to the downgraded rating, Nokia said it was working to lower costs and improve cash flow while introducing attractive new products. ''As we have detailed in recent announcements, Nokia is in the middle of a transformation program which encompasses every aspect of our business,'' Nokia said in a statement. ''We are implementing a decisive action plan to position our company for future growth and success.'' Nokia reported a net loss in its first quarter of 929 million euros as its sales plunged 29 percent. Moody's earlier this month also downgraded its rating of Nokia to junk status in light of its sales decline and competition from makers of other low-end phones. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

201204,Samsung Rides Smartphone Sales,"SEOUL – Soaring sales of smartphones lifted Samsung Electronics Co.'s profit to a company record in the first quarter and executives said that a new model hitting dealers next month will fuel its financial results during the second. Analysts estimate Samsung's telecom division reached two mileposts during the January-to-March period, passing Nokia Corp. as the world's top seller of cellphones and moving ahead of Apple Inc. again as the top seller of smartphones. Samsung last year stopped disclosing specific figures on cellphone sales, though an executive said Friday that first-quarter shipments fell by a ""low single digit"" percentage point from the last three months of 2011, when analysts estimate Samsung shipped 95 million units. The final quarter of the year is usually the strongest for sales of tech products. Strategy Analytics, a London-based market research firm, estimated that Samsung shipped 93.5 million cellphones in the first quarter. Nokia said last week it shipped 82.7 million phones in the first three months of the year, down about 24% from a year ago. Nokia, the struggling Finnish handset maker, has been rapidly losing market share to Apple, Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers using Google Inc.'s Android operating system, finally losing its 14-year crown as the world's largest handset maker by volume this quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. It was downgraded Friday for the third time in two weeks as Standard & Poor's became the latest ratings agency to cut Nokia's long-term credit rating to junk, forecasting a further drop in revenue in its devices unit this year. The market research company also estimated that Samsung shipped 44.5 million smartphones, well ahead of the 35 million smartphones Apple said earlier this week it shipped. Samsung and Apple see-sawed in the smartphone sales race last year. For the first time ever, Samsung and Apple together accounted for more than half of all smartphones shipped, Strategy Analytics said. With smartphones yielding bigger revenue and profit margins than regular cellphones, Samsung's telecom unit nearly doubled its revenue and nearly tripled its operating profit compared to a year ago. The business, which accounted for half of Samsung's sales in the first quarter, provided nearly three-quarters of its operating profit. The company's success in smartphones overshadowed difficulties in Samsung's chip division, which has traditionally been its main source of profits, and the relatively small profits of its other businesses. Sales and operating profit fell in the chip unit due to a sharp reduction in memory-chip prices and lower overall output as Samsung retrofitted factories. Samsung said its first-quarter profit rose 82% to a 5.05 trillion won, or about $4.45 billion. That beat its previous record net profit of 4.46 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2010 and the 2.78 trillion won in last year's first quarter. Samsung's revenue in the latest period was 45.27 trillion won, or $40 billion. That's up 22% from 36.99 trillion won in the year ago. The operating profit margin of Samsung's telecom unit reached 18.4%, the highest level since 2004. It marked a recovery from a sequential decline in the fourth quarter of last year, when Samsung ramped up marketing incentives to dealers to counter Apple's then-new version of its iPhone. In contrast to Apple's single-product approach, Samsung offers multiple versions of smartphones based on different operating software, though most of its sales come from models that use Google's Android. Next week, Samsung will unveil a new version of its flagship Android-based phone, expected to be called Galaxy S III. Executives on Friday said they are aiming for a near-global launch with a fast rollout in many countries. ""We expect it to be our most successful smartphone ever,"" Kim Hyun-joon, a vice president in Samsung's mobile communications business, said in a conference call with investment analysts. He added the product will ""substantially contribute"" to second-quarter results. The sharply improved performance of the telecom division reduced the effect of Samsung's volatile chip business on its overall results. With memory chips tumbling into a cyclical decline in pricing and profitability, Samsung's chip unit reported an operating profit margin of 9.5%, the lowest since the second quarter of 2009. Sales fell 13% against the year-ago period. Samsung said its display panel division, which makes liquid crystal displays for cellphones, computers and TVs, returned to profitability for the first time since 2010, with an operating profit margin of 3.3%. The company said it would merge the division with two other affiliated companies, creating a new firm that Samsung Electronics will still control but at a lower ownership level. The company's consumer electronics division, which is the world's largest producer of TVs, reported an operating profit margin of 4.9%, compared to about 1% a year ago and 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The jump is unusual for the early months of a year, a period when sales of TVs and other electronics tend to slow after peaking during year-end holidays. Executives attributed the profit jump to the timing of the release of new TV models. Samsung introduced new models in the quarter while other competitors will do so later in the year.

Bank of China's earnings growth slowed sharply, the first indication that China's slowing economy could end a streak of outsize profit growth among the nation's state-run banks. China's current-account surplus, the broadest measure of trade balance, shrank sharply in the first quarter on weaker export growth, confirming a slowdown trend suggested by earlier data. Exxon Mobil posted an 11% decline in earnings on lower production volumes and higher operating expenses, while Royal Dutch Shell's profit rose. Chinese oil company PetroChina posted a 5.8% increase in first-quarter net profit. Sinopec's earnings fell 35%. Japan Tobacco reported a 32% rise in its fiscal-year profit, driven by the strength of its overseas tobacco business, and unveiled a share-buyback plan valued at $3 billion to cushion the government's planned sale of its stake on the stock market. Softbank's profit surged in the latest fiscal year as subscriber growth and iPhone demand helped the mobile carrier brush off the emergence of a rival provider for Apple's smartphone. South Korea's economy grew at its strongest pace in a year in the first quarter, but officials cautioned that it reflected a front-loaded government budget. Indonesia's Pertamina sought to issue some $2.5 billion in debt in the international bond market, capping an active week for emerging-market borrowers.

201204,EURO CREDIT-Softer open after Spain downgrade; Italian auction eyed,"April 27 (IFR) - European credit markets are marginally on the back foot this morning despite a reasonable rally in US equities on Thursday. As of 0655GMT according to Tradeweb, the iTraxx Main index is 1.5bp wider at 145bp, the Crossover index is 7bp wider at 672bp and the Senior Financials index is 4bp wider at 251bp. It has been a while since the ratings agencies took action on the periphery, but last night S&P decided that enough was enough and promptly downgraded Spain by two notches to BBB+ and added a negative outlook too. The agency noted that Spain's ""budget trajectory will likely deteriorate against a background of economic contraction in contrast with our previous projections"". The downgrade of the sovereign was the first since PM Rajoy took office back in December. The agency also said that the Spanish government would probably need to provide further support to the banking sector. This roughly mirrored the Der Spiegel article from yesterday, which stated the ECB and a number of EU countries would like to change the conditions of the EFSF/ESM to permit it to lend directly to financial institutions in crisis. It has not been all doom and gloom overnight though. S&P also took a look at the darling of the periphery and promptly affirmed Ireland's rating at BBB+, albeit with an ongoing negative outlook. The agency pointed to Ireland's ""proactive and substantive"" response to its financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures, largely reiterating Draghi's sentiments at the last ECB post rate announcement press conference. The other positive overnight has come from Holland, where the Dutch parliament reached a deal on the 2013 budget in principle, although the details still need to be worked out. Meanwhile, the Q1 earnings season in Europe continues to tick along nicely with Daimler and BASF both easily beating analyst expectations. The market at the moment is content to focus on the negatives, however. This was clearly the case yesterday as a swathe of decent corporate earnings across the region were ignored, in favour of some less than impressive results from Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander. And so it seems likely that the Spanish downgrade will be seized upon this morning, with Spanish and Italian yields already widening appreciably in early trading. Spanish 10yr yields are beginning 15bp wider at 5.94%, approaching that psychological 6% level again having been at 5.70% yesterday morning. Italian 10yr yields are 17bp wider at 5.75%, which will be far more of a concern this morning given the Italian Tesoro's upcoming taps of on-the-run 5 and 10yr BTPs and off-the-run 4 and 7yrs. The renewed volatility this morning will not be welcomed by the primary dealership community that have to take down these taps, but there is the possibility that the early sell-off this morning may just prove supportive. On an outright basis, at current levels 10yr yields are roughly 100bp wider than the middle of March lows, and that is a hefty percentage move. The problem is that the market is still nervous on the second tier of the periphery, and those jitters will be heightened again this morning. On the plus side, the relatively small size of the auction (up to EUR2.5bn for the on-the-runs and up to EUR1.25bn on the off-the-runs) should be supportive, as should the relative value opportunities on the Italian curve. Looking at the on the run issues, the BTP4.75% May 2017 continues to trade very cheap on the matched maturity fly between the Feb 2017 and August 2017 issues and should start to richen up as it approaches benchmark size. The 10yr issue, BTP5.5% September 2022, also has that inherent new benchmark premium, and is trading 6bp over the old 15yr BTP (4.75% August 2023) in an otherwise normalized curve, representing a distinctly cheap kink. For the two off-the-run issues, the BTP3.75% April 2016 is cheap on the mis-matched fly between the November 2015 and August 2016 issues, while the BTP4.25% February 2019 also offers a couple of basis points value on the curve. That should all ensure reasonable digestion as long as domestic accounts turn up to the party. The results of the taps are announced 15 minutes after the bidding deadline of 0900GMT. As ever, the key points at those results will be the bid to cover ratios, the total amount sold and the average yield levels compared to the market as the bidding deadline expires. Pay no attention to previous auction yield levels, they are totally irrelevant. Once the auction results have been (hopefully) digested, it's time to head over the pond for Q1 GDP, which is expected to show a cooling to about 2.5% annualized growth from 3.0% in Q4 2011. Aside from GDP, in the US we get the Q1 Employment Cost Index, which is expected to rise to 0.5% from 0.4% in Q4. There is also Michigan Sentiment to contend with, where the final April number is expected to show a rise to 76.5 form 75.7. The European data session began with the German GFK index and Import Prices at the open. The former came in at 5.6 versus expectations of 5.9, while the latter printed at 0.7% m/m versus consensus of 0.9%. In the periphery we get Spanish inflation and Q1 unemployment at 0700GMT, which will be even more closely watched given the overnight events, while in Italy there is Retail Sales for February to contend with at 0800GMT.

201204,"UPDATE 2-Nokia suffers second cut to ""junk"" as S&P downgrades","* Rating cut to BB+ from BBB- * Fitch downgraded Nokia to junk earlier this week * Spreads at widest ever, pushes up CDS * Shares down 0.9 pct (Rewrites first paragraph, adds debt, CDS prices, details) By Tarmo Virki and Josie Cox HELSINKI/LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Cellphone maker Nokia Oyj had its credit rating cut to ""junk"" status by ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Friday, its second downgrade to non-investment grade status this week as the company battles falling sales and doubts over its product strategy. The rating cut, which follows a similar move by Fitch Ratings earlier this week, sent spreads on Nokia bonds to their widest ever against mid-swaps, a bond market benchmark, and pushed the price of insuring Nokia debt against default to its highest-ever level, indicating a growing level of investor concerns about the company's prospects. Its shares were down 0.9 percent at 2.732 euros by 1447 GMT, not far from a 15-year low of 2.60 euros set earlier this month. S&P said its downgrade reflected its concerns that the decline in sales at Nokia's phone business this year could be similar to the 18 percent fall in 2011. It cut its rating to BB+ from BBB-, at which point Nokia debt is rated as too risky to be bought by many pension funds and other mainstream investors, and said the company's credit rating outlook remained negative. Nokia, once the world's dominant mobile phone provider , has lost out to Apple Inc and Google Inc in the smartphone business and Chief Executive Stephen Elop is pinning hopes of a turnaround on Lumia, a new range of smartphones which use Microsoft software. But sales of the new range have so far been slow and are yet to compensate for diving sales of legacy products. RAPID DECLINE ""We still expect revenue from Lumia smartphones to grow over time, but not sufficiently to offset a rapid decline in revenue from Symbian-based smartphones over the next few quarters,"" S&P analysts said in a note. Nokia said it had 4.9 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in net cash reserves and was trying to turn around the business. ""The main focus of these actions is on lowering the company's costs, improving cash flow and maintaining a strong financial position, while bringing attractive new products to market,"" finance director Timo Ihamuotila said in a statement. Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Nokia debt rose 50 basis points to an all-time high of 645 basis points, according to Markit. This means it costs $645,000 annually to buy $10 million of protection against a Nokia default using a five-year CDS contract. Nokia has issued two eurobonds worth in total 1.75 billion euros and two dollar bonds worth a combined $1.5 billion. Nokia's 5.5 pct April 2014 euro note's asset swap spread widened 65 basis points to its highest ever at 495.6 basis point, while the spread on the 6.75 pct April 2019 note was 48 basis points wider at 682 basis points, according to Tradeweb.

201204,"Apple sales rocket in China, but growth may slow","HONG KONG, April 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is likely to see its sales growth nearly double in greater China this year, but the pace will probably taper thereafter as competitors hit back with new products in the biggest global mobile phone market. For the world's most valuable technology to get a bigger slice of the China market, it will also have to come up with an iPhone that supports the biggest Chinese mobile carrier's proprietary technology, settle an iPad trademark dispute and create more official sales outlets. Apple's sales in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, expanded three-fold to $7.9 billion in the first quarter, making up a fifth of the total figure. Sales are on track to nearly double in 2012 from last year's $13.3 billion. ""We may not see a repeat of this year's stellar pace of growth in coming years unless Apple comes up with great products to keep up with consumers' demand and tastes,"" said Candice Wang, an analyst with research firm Analysys International. Apple has been successful in raking in sales in China's wealthy first- or second-tier cities, b ut less so in the wider Chinese market, where overall income levels are still low. Consumers with deep pockets generally see Apple as a premium product and status symbol, analysts say, and are willing to overlook certain drawbacks - such as that ""Siri"", the iPhone's voice-enabled personal assistant technology, does not speak Chinese. ""I see everybody using an iPhone, so I decided to buy one,"" said a user whose surname is Zhou, who lives in China's wealthy coastal province of Jiangsu. ""I love the screens and the applications are really sleek."" She has switched iPhones within a year to keep up with Apple's latest gadgets. But for most of China, especially in third- or fourth-tier cities, that is not the case. A basic iPhone 4S costs 4,988 yuan ($790), which is more than what many Chinese make in a month. Even though Chinese salaries are on the rise, per capita urban disposable income was only 21,810 yuan ($3,500) in 2011, while per capita rural income was only 6,977 yuan. For many Chinese consumers, the iPhone is out of reach and most have instead bought cheaper smartphones running Google's Android operating system, from the likes of ZTE Corp's . ZTE's U880 smartphone costs less than 800 yuan and the Coolpad 9930 model sells at 1,670 yuan. ""There is no doubt that Apple's sales will keep rising, but market share is a different story,"" said CK Lu, analyst at Gartner. ""If Apple wants to maintain or grow its market share, it will have to cooperate with its partners to roll out more affordable smartphones."" With China's smartphone shipments expected to hit 137-140 million in 2012, exceeding the United States for the first time, according to research firms IDC and Gartner, the potential is huge in an country with more than a billion mobile phone users. For now, Apple still has the upper hand in the high-end smartphone sector. ""I've tried out iPhone 4S and Lumia 900 and I personally feel that if one really wants to buy a handphone, iPhone 4S is the way to go,"" Luo Wen, an Apple user based in the southern province of Guangdong, said in his microblog. ""Nokia is lagging behind by a far margin in terms of the overall feel of its products."" CLOCK TICKING ON CHINA MOBILE DEAL Apple is expected to sell 16 million smartphones in China in 2012, double 2011's total mainly due to the addition of China Telecom as a carrier partner, IDC said. China Unicom is the other official carrier that sells iPhones, leaving China Mobile, the biggest operator, the only one without an Apple contract. ""The clock is ticking for both parties to get a deal done,"" said Wong Teck Zhung, senior analyst at IDC. ""China Mobile might lose patience and decide to go for flagship handsets from other vendors while consumers, increasingly aware of non-iPhone alternatives, might also just get tired of waiting."" Wong said chances of a deal would bump up significantly if the upcoming version of iPhone supported China Mobile's 4G TD-LTE and its proprietary 3G technologies, provided Apple uses one of Qualcomm Inc's high-end Snapdragon chipsets. In the tablet PC sector, Apple's iPad now dominates the China market with a more than 70 percent market share. However, it has not launched its latest iPad product due to its lawsuit with a near-bankrupt Chinese technology company called Proview International Holdings, which says it owns the ""iPad"" trademark in China. That legal tussle is awaiting a ruling from the Higher People's Court in Guangzhou.

201204,INSTANT VIEW 3-Samsung posts record $5.15 bln profit,"SEOUL, April 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co , the world's top technology firm by revenue, reported a record quarterly profit on Friday, powered by booming sales of its smartphones and the Galaxy Note phone/tablet. The South Korean firm reported January-March operating profit of 5.85 trillion won ($5.15 billion), broadly in line with its earlier estimate of 5.8 trillion won and nearly double the 2.95 trillion won a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2011 the company had an operating profit of 5.3 trillion won. Following are reactions from fund managers and analysts. ---------------------------------------------------------------- BAE SEUNG-CHUL, ANALYST, BARCLAYS ""The numbers today don't come as a surprise as they were within the range of earlier forecasts...profit margins will be sustained in the coming months as the Galaxy S 3 is about to be launched and its market-surprising Galaxy Note is expected to perform strongly globally as well."" BRIAN PARK, ANALYST, TONG YANG SECURITIES ""Handset momentum will continue this quarter when the new Galaxy S hits the market ahead of the launch of the new iPhone launch, its major competitor. The Galaxy S 3's specifications are expected to be sensational and it is already drawing strong interest from the market and consumers."" ""Samsung's handset earnings may weaken in the latter half of this year, with the possible launch of Apple's iPhone 5, but the recovery of chips and displays will more than offset potential drops, helping sustaining earnings momentum."" LEE SEI-CHEOL, ANALYST, MERITZ SECURITIES ""The smartphone market has almost only two players - Samsung and Apple. Expanding its line-up, Samsung saw a huge jump in profits in its handset business despite the first quarter being an off-season."" ""Chip prices are growing in the second quarter as contract prices show, which will also contribute to Samsung's earnings."" ""Since its Galaxy 3 phone is being unveiled in May, Samsung will keep enjoying sales growth in its mobile phone division."" SHIN HYUN JOON, ANALYST, DONGBU SECURITIES ""Samsung is likely to maintain its strong performance until Q3 as additions to its premium line-up such as the Galaxy S3 are due to be released. However, the company is set to launch a low-end smartphone at the end of 2012, which could drag on margins."" ""2012 will see strong demand for handsets in the first half, boosted by sports events like the London Olympics. In contrast, Q4 will likely see weak earnings as the semiconductor and display markets usually face inventory adjustment during the period.""

201204,S.&P. Downgrades Nokia's Bonds to Junk,"12:27 p.m. | Updated Adding Nokia's response and information on its earnings. Standard & Poor's downgraded Nokia's bonds on Friday to junk status, noting that the company's first-quarter revenue fell below its expectations, particularly because sales of its phones that include the older Symbian software had fallen so drastically. S.& P.'s announcement came as Samsung dethroned Nokia as the world's No. 1 maker of mobile phones, which includes traditional cellphones and smartphones. Samsung sold 92 million phones over the last quarter, and Nokia sold 83 million, according to estimates by IHS iSuppli, the research firm. It is the first time since 1998 that Nokia is not the No. 1 brand in the world. In the smartphone category, Nokia slips to third place behind Apple, the leader with 35 million phones shipped, and Samsung, with 32 million devices, according to iSuppli. In that category, Nokia is slipping faster than Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry. The smartphone segment is the only part of the handset market that is showing any growth. Nokia's long-term rating was dropped to a noninvestment rating, BB+, from the investment-grade rating BBB-, with a negative outlook, S.& P. said. Its short-term rating dropped to B from A-3, S.& P. said. Nokia has been struggling to reverse its declining fortunes with its Lumia smartphones, which include Microsoft's newer operating system, Windows Phone 7. In the United States, AT&T and Nokia have been aggressively promoting the Lumia 900, a $100 smartphone that has been a strong seller on Amazon.com. But even the Lumia phones won't help Nokia recover quickly, S.& P. said. ""We still expect revenue from Lumia smartphones to grow over time but not sufficiently to offset a rapid decline in revenue from Symbian-based smartphones over the next few quarters,"" S.& P. said in a research note. In response to the downgraded rating, Nokia said it was working to lower costs and improve cash flow while introducing attractive new products. ""As we have detailed in recent announcements, Nokia is in the middle of a transformation program which encompasses every aspect of our business,"" Nokia said in a statement. ""We are implementing a decisive action plan to position our company for future growth and success.""

201204,"Corporate News: Softbank Profit Surges --- Firm Credits iPhone Sales, Solid Subscriber Growth for 65% Gain","Softbank Corp.'s profit surged 65% for the latest fiscal year as solid subscriber growth and iPhone demand helped the mobile carrier brush off a new rival provider for Apple Inc.'s smartphone. Unwilling to let Softbank rest on its success, President Masayoshi Son set ambitious plans for growth and dividends. Japan's third-largest mobile carrier by subscriptions on Thursday said net profit rose to 313.76 billion yen ($3.86 billion yen) for the year through March, from 189.71 billion yen the previous year. Operating profit increased to 675.28 billion yen from 629.16 billion yen Revenue increased 6.6% to 3.202 trillion yen. A spokesman said fourth-quarter net rose to 63.7 billion yen from 47.4 billion yen a year earlier. Softbank targeted 1 trillion yen in operating profit for fiscal 2017. The company, which has large holdings in Yahoo Japan Corp. and China's Alibaba Group, announced an eightfold increase in the dividend for the past fiscal year to 40 yen a share. ""I'm not satisfied [even] with this level"" of dividends, Mr. Son told reporters. He declined to give a figure for future payments, ""but at least, I want to continue at this level,"" he said. ""In the medium- to long-term, I'm still not satisfied."" Earnings at Tokyo-based Softbank, one of Asia's biggest Internet companies, have climbed in recent years on the back of strong demand for the iPhone and other Apple products. The smartphone has helped Softbank win new customers and, like other data-intensive smartphones, generates higher revenue than typical cellphones. KDDI Corp. in October ended Softbank's monopoly as a provider of the iPhone in Japan. Average revenue per user for Softbank's data-transmission segment rose to 2,510 yen for the past year from 2,310 yen, propelled by the growth in iPhone users. Overall ARPU, including revenue from voice services, fell to 4,150 yen from 4,210 yen. Softbank embarked on a sales campaign that helped its net growth in subscribers stay ahead of that for KDDI in the month after the iPhone 4S was introduced in October. Apart from in January, Softbank has outpaced its competitor in monthly net subscriber growth. Softbank added a net 3.54 million subscribers in the fiscal year, compared with 2.12 million for market leader NTT Docomo Inc. and 2.11 million for KDDI's au service. Softbank cited the rise in subscribers and sales of the iPhone 4S as main engines of the company's revenue growth. Softbank said a new service band it will start using this year will drive subscriber growth. The company in March was allocated a 900-megahertz Platinum Band for its mobile network that Softbank said will enable more efficient and wider coverage than existing service. Softbank said a survey suggested that the company could reap a 30% increase in users looking to switch from other carriers after the benefits of the new band were explained. Mr. Son said the company ""far exceeded"" goals set during the global financial crisis in 2008 of achieving 1 trillion yen in free cash flow and halving the company's interest-bearing debt. The company had made erasing such debt one of Softbank's highest priorities. He said many shareholders and analysts questioned ""whether it was really the most desirable thing to eliminate it,"" he said. The company changed course and now is seeking a balance among reducing interest-bearing debt, returning value to shareholders and pursuing growth, he said.

201204,What tech manufacturers and suppliers say about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand,"What tech manufacturers and suppliers have been saying about the impact from heavy flooding in Thailand: Oct. 12, 2011: Seagate Technology PLC, which makes hard drives, says its factories in Thailand have been operational, but it may have difficulty making hard drives because of constraints in getting parts. Oct. 17: Computer hard drive maker Western Digital Corp. says flooding damage to its Thailand locations will have a significant impact on its operations and its ability to meet customer demand the rest of the year. Oct. 18: Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook says he is ""virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives."" Cook warns that Apple's Mac lines will be most affected. Oct. 19: Data storage equipment maker Emulex Corp. says a subcontracted manufacturing facility in Ayudhaya has suspended operations due to flooding. Oct. 24: Fabrinet, which provides services and parts for optical, electro-mechanical and electronic manufacturing companies, says it expects its Chokchai plants to remain shuttered through the rest of the quarter. Emcore Corp., which makes semiconductor-based components for broadband, fiber optic, solar and other markets, says flooding penetrated a contractor's production facility over the weekend, submerging some equipment. Emcore says it will have trouble meeting customer demand for fiber optic products, but it's ramping up production in China and other areas. The company's solar division wasn't affected by the floods. Oct. 26: Computer networking equipment maker Digi International Inc. says flooding inundated an unnamed contract manufacturer, leaving it unclear when it can resume working with Digi. Digi says it has halted all of its Thailand-based operations as it reviews how it to meet existing business requirements by working with other contract manufacturers or using its own manufacturing operation in the U.S. and inventory on hand. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. warns that supply-chain uncertainties because of the flooding may weigh on fourth-quarter results. Nov. 1: JDS Uniphase Corp., which makes products for communications companies to test the quality of their networks, says it expects revenue in the current quarter to be reduced by $35 million to $45 million because of flooding. It says it has added employees in Thailand to help meet customer's needs. Nov. 2: Lenovo Group Ltd., a leading maker of personal computers, says flooding in Thailand will likely impact the global supply of hard disk drives. It says it will ""monitor the situation closely and take necessary actions to mitigate the potential impact."" Nov. 9: Cisco Systems Inc. says it is closely watching fallout from the flooding, particular for the effect on disk drives for its set-top boxes and on its optical-networking products. It says it has contingency plans in place to minimize any impact and has factored that into forecasts, but it expects things won't return to normal for several quarters. Nov. 10: Research group IDC says the disaster's real effect isn't expected to hit makers of personal computers until early next year. In a worst-case scenario, PC shipments could drop more than 20 percent from previous forecasts in the first quarter of 2012. IDC says many of the personal computers that will be sold during the holiday season have already been produced or can be made with existing supplies of hard drives, limiting disruptions from the flooding. Nov. 15: Dell Inc. says revenue will likely be hampered in the next few quarters because of shortages in hard drives. The company says it still cannot pinpoint the magnitude or duration of hard drive shortages because of the complexity of the situation. That means the industry needs to pay attention to how it allocates its resources through at least the first quarter of 2012. Dell notes that it has worked through other supply shortages in the industry before. Nov. 16: NetApp Inc., a data-storage company, says supplies of hard disk drives are probably adequate for the current quarter, but flooding may affect revenue and margins next year. Nov. 17: Marvell Technology Group Ltd., which makes digital storage devices and network components and chips for smartphones and other wireless devices, says damage from the floods will have an effect on its business, but the company says it has a strong balance sheet and diverse sources of revenue, which will help it manage those effects. Nov. 21: Hewlett-Packard Co. says supply constraints should start to ease by the end of the fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. But the company says the situation remains dynamic. ""I've been on the phone with the heads of all four of our disk drive partners and I'm not even sure they have a complete picture about when they're going to be back up and running,"" CEO Meg Whitman said. She says the company expects to get more than its fair share of drives because of long-term relationships with suppliers, but ""this is going to be pretty tough for the industry."" Nov. 22: TiVo Inc. warns of increased costs for hard drives in the current quarter. Nov. 28: Seagate says it will hit the low end of its previously forecast range of disk drive shipments. Seagate now expects to ship 43 million units in the current quarter. In October, it had projected 40 million to 50 million units. Nov. 30: Analog and mixed-signal semiconductor maker Semtech Corp. says it expects results to be hampered in the current quarter. It issues a quarterly forecast that is short of analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue. Dec. 8: IHS iSuppli estimates that the flooding will result in a shortfall of nearly 4 million PCs -- most of them laptops -- shipped in the first quarter of 2012. The research firm now expects global PC shipments to total 84.2 million in the period, down from a previous estimate of 88 million. This would be a drop of nearly 12 percent from the October-to-December period, using iSuppli's estimate of 95.3 million PCs in the current quarter. Dec. 12: Intel Corp. cuts its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, saying that companies are reducing inventories and microprocessor purchases because of shortages of hard drives. Jan. 4, 2012: Seagate says it shipped more hard disk drives in its December quarter than it had expected and will post revenue above its earlier guidance. Jan. 5: Research firm Gartner Inc. lowers its global technology spending growth forecast because of the sluggish economy and the euro crisis. Gartner says the computer hardware sector will be the hardest hit, hurt by supply constraints in the hard disk drive industry. Jan. 12: Gartner and IDC both say personal-computer shipments dipped slightly during the final three months of last year. Although sales have already been hurt by the popularity of mobile devices, the disk drive shortages compounded the problem. Jan. 18: Sanmina-SCI Corp., which makes parts used in electronic equipment, says its fiscal first-quarter net income plunged 70 percent as flooding in Thailand and weakness in its communications networks division hurt sales. Jan. 23: Western Digital CEO John Coyne says progress in restoring capacity in Thailand is ""significantly ahead of our original expectations"" and is reflected in the results in the latest quarter. Chip-maker International Rectifier Corp. cuts its revenue forecast for the last three months of 2011 because of lower demand in China and Europe and supply-chain disruptions due to flooding. Jan. 24: II-VI Inc., which makes lenses and other parts for lasers, says its profit dropped 31 percent in the fiscal second quarter as flooding in Thailand hurt its optics business. Server technology company Super Micro Computer Inc. reaffirms that the impact of hard drive supplies will make the current quarter challenging. Revenue in the latest quarter grew less than 1 percent, hurt by the shortages. Jan. 25: Molex Inc., which makes electronic components and cables, says its fiscal second-quarter net income fell 18 percent on a one-time charge and higher expenses as revenue declined due to flooding. Semiconductor maker LSI Corp. predicts it will start the new year with a surprisingly strong quarter. The outlook helps assure investors that LSI is past the problems caused by the hard disk shortages, which had threatened to have ripple effects on LSI's semiconductors for data storage and networking. Jan. 26: Japanese electronics company NEC Corp. says it is slashing 10,000 jobs worldwide and would lose money for the full year amid weakness in its mobile phone business and flooding in Thailand, which hit its platform business. The flooding damaged its factory, and NEC says it planned to build a replacement. Marvell Technology lowers its fourth-quarter revenue outlook, citing Thailand flooding and weak year-end demand among mobile and wireless customers. Emulex Corp., a maker of data storage and network equipment, says it was able to restore full production capacity at a cost of $2.1 million, reducing gross margins during the latest quarter. Feb. 7: Emerson Electric says its net income fell 23 percent as the diversified manufacturing and technology company saw costs rise and sales take a hit from flooding in Thailand. Flooding caused supply chain disruptions that hurt results at Emerson's process management division and to a lesser extent at its network power business, delaying about $300 million in sales, most of which are expected to be recovered this year. Feb. 9: Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's second-biggest maker of PCs, says a global shortage caused by flooding is adding $5 to $10 to the cost of each hard drive. Chief Financial Officer Wong Waiming says the impact of the floods on hard drive production will ""likely continue to affect global PC supply"" into the next quarter and hard drive costs ""will continue to stay high in the short term."" Feb. 22: Hewlett Packard Co. blames flooding for more than half of its drop in revenue, a 7 percent decline to $30 billion. HP says it decided to divert supplies of drives to higher-margin products. It expects constraints to continue in the quarter through April, but the effect on revenue should be smaller compared with the recent quarter. March 29: Data storage provider Xyratex Ltd. says its net income in the latest quarter more than doubled, despite flooding in Thailand hindering its ability to meet customer needs. Xyratex, based in England, had warned that it may have trouble meeting its customer's storage demands because of a limited supply of certain disk drives. April 11: Estimates from Gartner and IDC suggest that PC manufacturers have mitigated hard drive supply constraints. Gartner says there were moderate problems in selected markets, such as low-end consumer laptops, but ""low PC demand was able to mask the tight (hard drive) supply overall."" IDC says larger PC makers such as HP and Dell succeeded in managing inventory and absorbing price increases in the parts. April 17: Intel's results for the first quarter were held back by the hard-drive shortage. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology, a hard-drive maker, says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. Wednesday: Hard-drive maker Western Digital Corp. says the company and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,"A look at how selected chipmakers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: April 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC estimate that PC shipments in the first quarter were ahead of their expectations, though growth was modest in light of competition from smartphones and tablet computers. Hewlett-Packard Co. appeared to have regained some of the business it had lost as it was weighing whether to dump its PC business. Lenovo Group Ltd. showed strong gains over last year. Dell Inc.'s market share fell as it focused on higher-end, higher-profit machines. April 17: IBM Corp. reports flat revenue, falling short of analysts' expectations. Software and services revenue grew, but IBM's hardware and financing segments saw a decline. Intel Corp. reports first-quarter results that were held back by a shortage of hard drives, which meant that PC makers had to curb production and needed fewer Intel chips. The scarcity was caused by flooding of hard-drive factories in Thailand last year. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology PLC reports that its earnings in the latest quarter surged and revenue almost doubled. CEO Steve Luczo says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. But Seagate says it also shifted its product line to ""industry-leading products"" across all of its markets. April 18: Strong demand boosted revenue at Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs says the company benefited from growing global demand for new 3G- and 4G-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. But he says the cost of making more 28 nanometer chips could cut into profit margins in upcoming months. April 19: Microsoft Corp. reports a surprise rise in sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers. Analysts had assumed that many businesses and consumers thinking about buying a PC would hold off until Windows 8 hits the market in the fall. That didn't turn out to be the case as revenue in the Windows division increased 4 percent in the latest quarter. EMC Corp., one of the world's largest makers of data-storage computers, says first-quarter earnings jumped 23 percent, boosted by increased demand for its cloud computing products. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. says its computing solutions unit had flat revenue, while the graphics segment saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue because of lower demand for desktop and mobile graphics. SanDisk Corp., a maker of flash memory, says quarterly earnings sank by almost half amid weak demand and low selling prices -- trends the company expects will continue in the current quarter. The company says it expects demand to rise, but not until the second half of 2012. Altera Corp., a semiconductor maker, reports weak results it attributes to lighter-than-expected demand for its products, particularly from customers in the communications industry. In addition, the company said it had some issues trying to fill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. The company expects its business to rebound in the second quarter and says its backlog has significantly improved since the end of the quarter on stronger demand for its products. Monday: Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. says the business cycle ""bottomed"" in the first quarter. Orders rose 13 percent. CEO Rich Templeton says 2012 will be ""a good year for growth."" Xerox Corp. says revenue from its services business grew, while technology revenue, such as sales of document systems and supplies, declined. Services now make up more than half the company's revenue. Tuesday: Apple Inc.'s Mac sales for the quarter came in slightly below expectations, at 4 million. But Apple once again reported blowout iPhone sales, along with iPad sales that were two and a half times what it sold a year earlier. The relative strength of iPhone sales means they accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent. Wednesday: Business software maker SAP AG says net income rose 10 percent in the first quarter. It cited strong sales momentum for its high-speed HANA data platform and cloud-computing acquisition SuccessFactors. Thursday: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which supplies chips under contract for other companies including Apple, predicts ""solid growth"" with stronger-than-anticipated demand for smartphones and tablet computers coming from the U.S. and China. Western Digital Corp., a leading maker of hard drives, says production is heading back up. That led to a drop in its stock price, as a bigger supply could lead to lower prices. CEO John Coyne says Western Digital and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods that hit factories in Thailand last year. They had led to industrywide shortages of hard drives.

Nokia Corp. says sales of smartphones dropped to 12 million in the first quarter, from 24 million a year earlier, while volume sales of cellphones fell to 83 million from 108 million a year earlier. Tuesday: Apple Inc. says it sold 35 million iPhones in the quarter, almost twice as many as it sold a year ago and above analyst expectations. IPad sales came in below analyst expectations, at 11.8 million units. But that was still two and a half times as many as it sold in the same quarter a year ago. Mac sales were also slightly below expectations, at 4 million. That was 7 percent more than a year ago. Apple sold 7.7 million iPods, down 15 percent from a year earlier. AT&T Inc. says it activated 4.3 million iPhones in the first quarter. That was down from 7.6 million in the fourth quarter, when AT&T began selling the iPhone 4S. However, the number was still up from the 3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold in the same quarter a year ago. HTC Corp. reports a drop in first-quarter earnings and revenue as it faces competition from Apple and Samsung, but it expects revenue to rise in the current quarter with its ""HTC One"" series phone that offers users a better camera and music experience in addition to a sleek design. HTC says its biggest challenges had been the iPhone 4S's launch late last year. It expects to win back some of the U.S. market and expand its markets in Europe and Asia. HTC doesn't disclose the number of devices it sold, citing competitive reasons. Wednesday: TomTom says it sold 1.4 million personal-navigation devices in North America, down from 2.1 million a year ago. In Europe, it sold 2 million, down from 2.4 million. TomTom says overall market share was relatively flat at 46 percent in Europe and 24 percent in North America. Thursday: Nintendo Co. says it sold 9.8 million Wii machines over the fiscal year that just ended, fewer than the 15 million it had sold the previous fiscal year, and below its initial hopes of selling 13 million machines. It remained optimistic for the fiscal year through March 2013, and forecast sales of 10.5 million Wii machines. The Wii U, which will have a touch-screen controller, comes out this year. Friday: Samsung Electronics Co., maker of the Galaxy line of phones and tablet computers, doesn't disclose the number of smartphones it sells. It reports significant sales growth of high-end smartphones in developing markets including China, a key battlefield for mobile phone makers.

201204,S&P downgrades Nokia after report shows Samsung overtaking it as largest cell phone maker,"HELSINKI (AP) - Standard and Poor's on Friday downgraded Nokia's credit rating by one notch and warned that it may reduce it again unless the company's performance improves. The rating agency said it was lowering the Finnish company's long-term corporate credit rating to BB+ from BBB- and its short-term corporate credit rating to B from A-3. The downgrade came after Nokia Corp. posted huge first-quarter losses and a 30 percent drop in sales and a report earlier Friday estimated Samsung Electronics Co. had overtaken it as the world's largest maker of mobile phones. ""We now expect Nokia to report significantly lower margins and cash flows in 2012 than we had previously expected,"" S&P said. ""The outlook is negative, reflecting the possibility of a further downgrade if Nokia fails to stabilize revenues and margins and significantly cut its cash losses."" Nokia CFO Timo Ihamuotila said the company was in transition, a year after it teamed up with Microsoft Corp. to incorporate Windows software in its new handsets. ""Nokia is in the middle of a transformation program which encompasses every aspect of our business,"" Ihamuotila said, adding that the company was ""implementing a decisive action plan"" to improve growth. ""The main focus of these actions is on lowering the company's costs, improving cash flow and maintaining a strong financial position, while bringing attractive new products to market,"" he said, but gave no details. Nokia's share price closed down slightly at (EURO)2.74 ($3.62) in Helsinki. Last week, Nokia announced one of its worst quarterly results ever, blaming tough competition for a (EURO)929 million ($1.2 billion) net loss as sales plunged, especially in the smartphone market. It said it expects no improvement in the second quarter. The cell phone maker is fighting fierce competition in the top-end from Apple Inc.'s iPhone and other makers using Google Inc.'s popular Android software, including Samsung and HTC of Taiwan. It is also being squeezed in the low-end by Asian manufacturers making cheaper phones, such as China's ZTE. Boston-based Strategy Analytics said Friday that Samsung surpassed Nokia as the world's largest seller of cell phones by volume, grabbing a 25 percent global market share against Nokia's 22 percent. The agency's report also said that Samsung had overtaken Apple as the largest maker of smartphones selling 44.5 million units against Apple's 35 million. Nokia dropped to third place with under 12 million sold in the quarter, Strategy Analytics said. Fitch ratings agency recently downgraded Nokia to junk status, while Moody's has cut it to near junk status. ---------- Online: http://www.nokia.com 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,Strong smartphone sales fuel Samsung's quarterly profit to a record high,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - A surge in Galaxy smartphone sales fueled earnings at Samsung Electronics to a record high in the first quarter, usually a tough season for the global consumer electronics industry, outshining handset rivals such as Nokia Corp. Samsung sold more smartphones in the first three months of the year than Apple Inc. and raked in more than 70 percent of its operating profit from mobile businesses. Shares of Samsung Electronics Co. shot up nearly 3 percent. Net profit nearly doubled from a year earlier to a record 5.05 trillion won ($4.46 billion) for the fiscal quarter ended March 31. Operating profit also logged a record high: 5.85 trillion won, which was in line with the company's guidance provided earlier this month. Sales rose 22 percent from a year earlier to 45.3 trillion won. Strong demand for high-end smartphones, such as the Galaxy Note and the Galaxy S2 introduced last year, helped mask lower profit from memory chips, another Samsung flagship business. ""It was a shock for semiconductor, a surprise for handset,"" said Lee Ka-keun, a Seoul-based analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities. The Suwon, Korea-based company expects to outdo its record profit in the coming quarters. It will announce a new version of the Galaxy phone next week and global demand for personal computers is picking up, bringing more cash to memory chipmakers. ""We cautiously expect our earnings momentum to continue going forward, as competitiveness in our major businesses is enhanced,"" Robert Yi, head of investor relations, said on a conference call. Samsung's mobile communications division, which includes smartphones, pocketed 4.27 trillion won of operating profit in the quarter after seeing significant sales growth of high-end smartphones in developing markets including China, a key battlefield for mobile phone makers. After narrowly beating Apple last year, Samsung's smartphone sales exceeded Apple's by a large margin in the first quarter. Strategy Analytics said Samsung became the world's top smartphone maker, selling 44.5 million handsets in the January-March period, followed by Apple's 35.1 million. Yet Apple's iPhone and iPad business remains more lucrative. The Cupertino, California-based company earned $11.6 billion in the January-March quarter, more than twice as much as Samsung, even though its revenue was about 10 percent less. Once regarded as a laggard in smartphones, Samsung moved rapidly to take on Apple with Google Inc.'s Android operating system. Samsung's rise came largely at the expense of Nokia. The Finish handset giant, which had been the world's biggest handset maker since 1998, reported a dismal loss in the latest quarter and fell behind Samsung in shipments. According to Strategy Analytics data, Nokia sold about 10 million fewer handsets than Samsung in the quarter. Samsung's mobile business president, Shin Jong-kyun, told reporters in February that it eyes 380 million handset sales this year, including 200 million smartphones. The company shipped 330 million handsets in 2011, including 97 million smartphones. While Samsung fights Apple in the smartphone and tablet markets and in bitter patent lawsuits on four continents, its first-quarter results also owed something to brisk sales of Apple's iPhone and iPad. Apple, which is Samsung's key customer in its semiconductor and display screen businesses, was credited for helping turn around Samsung's display panel division into profit. Samsung's display panel business posted a 280 billion won profit as increased sales of lucrative 3-D TV panels and high-resolution tablet PC panels propped up the bottom line. Samsung, which is the world's biggest supplier of memory chips, said its operating profit from its semiconductor business in the first quarter reached 760 billion won, less than half from a year earlier. Weak demand for personal computers sapped memory chip prices and forced Tokyo-based Elpida Memory Inc. to file for bankruptcy in February. The division that makes TVs and home appliances posted 530 billion won in operating profit. Samsung is the world's largest maker of flat-panel TVs, a sector that it competes with LG Electronics Inc. of South Korea and Sony Corp. of Japan. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,Heard on the Street / Financial Analysis and Commentary,"Foreign Investment Turning Against India Risks from dwindling foreign investment are looming for India. The solution requires some combination of an improving economy and a credible policy response. So far, neither is apparent. Institutional investment in the markets is drying up: Foreign portfolio investment shows a net outflow this month, compared with a $7.1 billion inflow in February. Direct investment has also remained subdued. Just five large deals made up over two-thirds of the total $27.5 billion of FDI in 2011. Only $4.2 billion had come in by this February. The rupee is showing the stress. It is down more than 4% this month. The scarcity of foreign capital can hit hard. India is a net importer with a bloated current-account deficit, which the government says likely reached a record high of 4% of gross domestic product last year. CLSA forecasts 3.9% for this fiscal year. Foreign funds are the only major contributor in offsetting the gap. A weaker currency also pushes up input costs for manufacturers importing raw materials and capital goods, hurting their margins. India can't fix sputtering growth and high inflation overnight, but it can take steps on other fronts, such as convincing long-term investors that their projects won't get stalled by delays in land acquisition or opaque tax laws. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India used an index to quantify the damage to foreign direct investment from government policy. The Kaufmann Index shows that every one-point improvement in the ""government effect"" could add four percentage points to the FDI/GDP ratio. In 2011, FDI was 25% below what it could have been with more-efficient government. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has promised reforms to attract foreign investors, but New Delhi is moving backward. A tax bill proposes that authorities be allowed to retroactively tax foreign investment deals going back as far as 50 years. Barring serious efforts from policy makers, India may continue to lack capital for infrastructure and manufacturing. The rupee has rung the warning bell and New Delhi needs to wake up. -- Harsh Joshi Apple Shine Is Back After Profit Report What goes up must come down. Or so Apple bears would have investors believe. But the company continues to defy gravity, for revenue and profit. Remarkably, Apple sold nearly as many iPhones in the March quarter -- 35 million -- as it did in the December quarter -- 37 million. That was despite the fact that the company benefited both from holiday purchases and pent-up demand for the new iPhone 4S late last year. Apple's revenue of $39.2 billion beat consensus expectations of $37 billion. The strong earnings report sent the company's shares up 9% in midday trading Wednesday. The robust iPhone results were partly thanks to big Asia sales. In China, Apple signed a new distribution agreement with China Telecom. It should get another boost if it signs a deal with the country's largest carrier, China Mobile, perhaps by early next year. Gross profit margin continued rising, to 48% from 45% last quarter and 41% a year ago. But in the current quarter the company expects lower-margin iPads and Macs to make up a larger percentage of sales, driving gross margins back below 42%. And it says revenue will be lower-than-expected at $34 billion. Yet it is hard to trust Apple's expectations since they routinely project results well short of what they deliver. Indeed, a previous clue suggests they're thinking much bigger. Apple said in its annual report to the SEC last October that it planned to spend $8 billion on capital expenditures for the fiscal year that ends this fall, up 88% compared with last year. Yet the company has only spent $2.8 billion through the first six months. Since much of Apple's capex buys equipment that manufacturing partners use to make iPhones, iPads and other products, it has been a good leading indicator of revenue in the past. Assuming Apple will stick to its investment plan, that could imply a rosier outlook for future gadget sales. -- Rolfe Winkler Taiwan's Semiconductor Canaries Still Singing Taiwan's semiconductor firms are the canaries in the global-trade coal mine. They're still singing. Production of semiconductors, crucial inputs into the computers and mobile phones assembled in China and shipped to the U.S. and Europe, are a leading indicator of the global trade cycle. A fall in capacity utilization rates that began in the second half of 2010 signaled a flagging global recovery, with weak consumer demand in the U.S. and Europe. But the first half of 2012 is offering signs of a rebound. Semiconductor manufacturer United Microelectronics's first-quarter report shows utilization rates at its foundry rebounding, up to 71% from 68% in the fourth quarter of 2011, with guidance for a number in the low 80% range in the second quarter. To be sure, that remains a long way from a peak of 100% in the first half of 2010. But the first increase after six consecutive quarters of falls could be a sign of better things to come. Consulting group Semiconductor Intelligence said in a recent report that utilization rates at UMC rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are also rising. With a three-month lead-in time for the production of semiconductors, that is a signal that producers are anticipating stronger demand. UMC is forecasting a 15% quarter-to-quarter increase in wafer shipments in the second quarter, up from 5%. Semiconductors are sometimes only semi-predictors. An uptick in capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2008 wasn't a good augury of the state of the world economy. In 2012, much production is being driven by the launch of new models of smartphones and laptops planned for summer. If demand for those products doesn't materialize, semiconductor firms will be left sitting on a lot of unsold inventory. But with uncertainty clouding the global outlook, and renewed worries about the European crisis, it is reassuring that the firms that lead the cycle are singing a happier tune. -- Paul Mozur and Tom Orlik License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Bullish on Indonesia --- Lippo Group Chief Says He Expects Consumers to Keep Spending,"JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The growing middle class here continues to spend at an unprecedented rate, undaunted by the slowdown in global growth or by infrastructure and policy gridlock at home, business leaders say. James Riady, chief executive of Lippo Group -- one of Indonesia's largest conglomerates, with a range of interests including property and supermarkets -- says there have been no signs of a slowdown in the spending by Indonesians that helped give Southeast Asia's largest economy one of the world's strongest growth rates last year. Economists warn that Indonesia's growth could hit a wall soon, since President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's coalition government has been unable to build much-needed infrastructure or pass important economic and political changes. Standard & Poor's -- the last major ratings service to rate Indonesian debt as junk -- on Monday decided not to upgrade the country's credit rating, citing ""policy slippages,"" such as the government's failure to raise fuel and electricity prices. Still, spending doesn't seem to be slipping, Mr. Riady says. Whether it is shoppers at the company's malls, subscribers to its television and broadband services or home buyers at its apartment complexes, Lippo Group continues to see strong growth and expects it to continue for the next five years as wealth spreads to the Indonesian archipelago's far-flung islands. ""We are entering a golden era where consumers are just starting to enjoy more than just the basics,"" Mr. Riady said in an interview Monday. ""It's propelling consumer sales to amazing new levels."" Indonesia's increasingly confident consumers are a primary reason why its gross domestic product rose 6.5% last year and could climb around the same pace this year. Unlike many of its Asian neighbors, Indonesia isn't dependent on exports for growth, so it has been able to shine while other Asian economies have struggled as their customers in the U.S. and Europe suffered. Continued consumer confidence here will help decide whether the country can become the next great boom market in Asia, after China and India, economists say. If measured by the number of people that make at least $3,000 a year, Indonesia's middle class made up 50 million of its nearly 250 million people in 2009, and that will triple to 150 million by 2014, according to PT Nomura Indonesia. Motorcycle sales, for example, jumped to more than eight million last year, more than double the level five years earlier. Middle-class spending will continue to climb, and power the Indonesian economy over the next five to 10 years, says Fauzi Ichsan, senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Jakarta. Indonesia's population is young, with a median age of 28.2 years, according to the CIA Factbook. That means a growing percentage of the population will be in the working and spending periods of their lives. Meanwhile, the banking sector is just taking off and as the sector expands, it will become easier for average Indonesians to get loans. Mr. Riady says Lippo Group's home sales, largely to the middle class, will be around $450 million this year, up from $100 million two years ago. He says sales at the group's hypermarkets will rise 40% this year from last and sales at its department stores will increase 25%. Mr. Riady predicts similar growth rates for the next three years. As the middle class demands better health care, Lippo Group is building hospitals across the country. The group plans to have 14 hospitals by year-end and add around 10 a year for the foreseeable future. Given new private and government investment in hospitals, Philips Electronics NV says it expects its annual health-care equipment sales in Indonesia -- which are already growing faster than in China and India -- to more than quadruple in the next three years. ""It's really exciting growth,"" coming from all over the country, says Wayne Spittle, Asia-Pacific head for Philips Healthcare. Some economists warn that the market could be overheating, putting too many cars on the road and pushing up property prices. Indeed, the central bank last month ratcheted up restrictions on loans for motorcycles, mortgages and cars. Still, rising incomes are expected to continue to boost demand for items, from smartphones, to refrigerators, to cut-price airline tickets. ""We have passed $3,000 GDP per capita, which has been a benchmark beyond which people are starting to have real money to spend,"" and that is creating more growth and new businesses, Mr. Riady says. ""There is so much more to be done."" License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,On the Road With the Proper Gear,"Last month, I was sitting in a club lounge in Newark Liberty International Airport when I noticed a man in the seat across from me with this technological array in front of him: ¶ A Windows 7-based tablet (I think it was an Asus). ¶ A Bluetooth keyboard. ¶ A Bluetooth mouse. ¶ A USB hub. ¶ A USB drive attached to the hub. Clearly, my man was no amateur — except maybe for that Windows tablet. He was a walking billboard for the latest technology. Post-PC? On it. Bluetooth devices? Got it. Solid-state memory? No doubt. But he had it all wrong. His setup was like an ill-conceived version of Voltron, Defender of the Universe, that 1980s Japanese cartoon about the little robots that combine to form one superrobot. Except in his case, all his little devices combined to form an unwieldy arsenal of silliness. I wanted to lean across the ottoman and say, “Psst, Homes, just get a laptop.” It can be easy to get caught up in the latest tech trend and think that it will solve all your problems. But that’s just not true. The Next Big Thing is not also the Only Thing. Tablets, for example, can be great for some things and less great for others. This principle is all the more important when you travel, since you want to take just as much as you need and not a device more. When I’m traveling for business, I make sure I’m equipped with the following tech items, and nothing else: A LAPTOP Is a tablet suitable for travel? Sure it is. If I’m headed out on vacation with my family and want something for e-mail, reading and emergency child sedation, my iPad is the first thing that goes into my carry-on. But if I intend to do some actual work, then it’s my laptop by a country mile. On the road, I’m using a zesty blend of off-the-shelf and bespoke software. I’m transferring files wirelessly through Dropbox and by thumb drive. I’m a writer, so I’m typing like a maniac. As for those five devices my frequent flier had cobbled together, a laptop elegantly integrates all of them; it has for years. In spite of recent “tablets will rule the world” hyperbole, there’s still some life in the old laptop. I use an 11-inch Apple MacBook Air, and it has become my indispensable business travel companion. Yes, it weighs a pound more than an iPad. And yes, I’m woefully out of shape, but I think I can handle the heft. If you’re inclined to go with a Windows machine, new “ultrabooks” are basically MacBook Air knockoffs (that’s a compliment, ultrabook makers). Ultrabooks come in many shapes and sizes, but the trick for travel is to get the smallest one (Asus’s Zenbook, which costs $900 to $1,100, has an 11.6-inch display, almost as small as the MacBook). You have to trust me on this: the screen may seem small, but you get used to it quickly, and it’s the perfect size for seat 21D, especially when the guy in 20D drops his seat down. Not to mention, it also glides into a shoulder bag. A SMARTPHONE You need a smartphone, of course. But you need one that has a certain feature: wireless tethering (also called mobile hot spot). That way, your phone can act as a wireless modem for your laptop, avoiding the need for a USB dongle or an external wireless hot spot device like a MiFi. That’s one less thing you have to carry. Some smartphones can use superfast 4G LTE networks, which may not mean much on a phone, but can pay off nicely when wirelessly tethered to a laptop. If that’s the case, check out the Samsung Galaxy Nexus on Verizon Wireless ($200 with contract). It’s not only LTE-capable, it has Ice Cream Sandwich, the latest Android operating system. That software can be frustratingly absent from other high-price Android phones, because of Google’s staged introduction of its mobile operating systems. HEADPHONES I carry two pairs of headphones: one noise-reducing set and one standard pair. Skip the bulky around-the-ear noise-reducing headphones and get in-ear models like AKG’s K390 NC ($200) or Panasonic’s RP HC55-S ($44 on Amazon) that cut down on airplane buzzing, but still fold up nicely in a bag. For just walking around, you’ll want a standard pair of in-ear headphones, preferably with a microphone and buttons to control smartphone features. Your smartphone most likely came with a pair. Many of these headphones come with detachable rubber earpieces. Do yourself a favor and go to a RadioShack or a Best Buy and spend $5 to get a pack of replacement earpieces. Those detachable buds are just that, and nothing’s worse than losing one just as you traipse out onto Boulevard Saint-Germain. BACKUP POWER FOR YOUR SMARTPHONE If you have a smartphone with a removable battery, by all means keep a charged backup in your bag. But if you’re without that option, check out Mophie’s Juice Pack Reserve ($35). It’s the size of a Zippo and provides enough power to an iPhone (about 33 percent) to get you back to your hotel room, office or any place with a wall outlet. Non-iPhone users can use Mophie’s Juice Pack Powerstation, which costs more ($80), but can recharge a phone up to four times on a single charge, or power up tablet computers as well. VARIOUS CORDS AND MORE You’re going to need the power cable for your laptop and the cable for your smartphone (along with its wall-charging adapter). I also like to bring an extra power strip, like Belkin’s Mini Surge Protector with USB Charger (sounds like a restaurant dish, doesn’t it? “Dayboat Scallops with Horseradish Aioli”). This $25 Snickers-bar-size powerstrip includes three outlets and two USB ports. It’s a dream when your hotel decides that you really need only one accessible outlet in the whole room. After that, it’s all software: Want to read a book? Get the Kindle app for your computer or phone. Movies? Rent some before you go from Amazon or iTunes and watch them on the plane. Camera, calculator, voice recorder, translator, GPS unit? That’s what your smartphone is for. The goal in travel — and in life in general — is to use the fewest objects with the greatest function. That’s what Mr. Platinum Elite missed with his panoply of devices. The savviest user of tech is the one who doesn’t look as if he’s using any tech at all.

In spite of recent ''tablets will rule the world'' hyperbole, there's still some life in the old laptop. I use an 11-inch Apple MacBook Air, and it has become my indispensable business travel companion. Yes, it weighs a pound more than an iPad. And yes, I'm woefully out of shape, but I think I can handle the heft. If you're inclined to go with a Windows machine, new ''ultrabooks'' are basically MacBook Air knockoffs (that's a compliment, ultrabook makers). Ultrabooks come in many shapes and sizes, but the trick for travel is to get the smallest one (Asus's Zenbook, which costs $900 to $1,100, has an 11.6-inch display, almost as small as the MacBook). You have to trust me on this: the screen may seem small, but you get used to it quickly, and it's the perfect size for seat 21D, especially when the guy in 20D drops his seat down. Not to mention, it also glides into a shoulder bag. A SMARTPHONE You need a smartphone, of course. But you need one that has a certain feature: wireless tethering (also called mobile hot spot). That way, your phone can act as a wireless modem for your laptop, avoiding the need for a USB dongle or an external wireless hot spot device like a MiFi. That's one less thing you have to carry. Some smartphones can use superfast 4G LTE networks, which may not mean much on a phone, but can pay off nicely when wirelessly tethered to a laptop. If that's the case, check out the Samsung Galaxy Nexus on Verizon Wireless ($200 with contract). It's not only LTE-capable, it has Ice Cream Sandwich, the latest Android operating system. That software can be frustratingly absent from other high-price Android phones, because of Google's staged introduction of its mobile operating systems. HEADPHONES I carry two pairs of headphones: one noise-reducing set and one standard pair. Skip the bulky around-the-ear noise-reducing headphones and get in-ear models like AKG's K390 NC ($200) or Panasonic's RP HC55-S ($44 on Amazon) that cut down on airplane buzzing, but still fold up nicely in a bag. For just walking around, you'll want a standard pair of in-ear headphones, preferably with a microphone and buttons to control smartphone features. Your smartphone most likely came with a pair. Many of these headphones come with detachable rubber earpieces. Do yourself a favor and go to a RadioShack or a Best Buy and spend $5 to get a pack of replacement earpieces. Those detachable buds are just that, and nothing's worse than losing one just as you traipse out onto Boulevard Saint-Germain. BACKUP POWER FOR YOUR SMARTPHONE If you have a smartphone with a removable battery, by all means keep a charged backup in your bag. But if you're without that option, check out Mophie's Juice Pack Reserve ($35). It's the size of a Zippo and provides enough power to an iPhone (about 33 percent) to get you back to your hotel room, office or any place with a wall outlet. Non-iPhone users can use Mophie's Juice Pack Powerstation, which costs more ($80), but can recharge a phone up to four times on a single charge, or power up tablet computers as well. VARIOUS CORDS AND MORE You're going to need the power cable for your laptop and the cable for your smartphone (along with its wall-charging adapter). I also like to bring an extra power strip, like Belkin's Mini Surge Protector with USB Charger (sounds like a restaurant dish, doesn't it? ''Dayboat Scallops with Horseradish Aioli''). This $25 Snickers-bar-size powerstrip includes three outlets and two USB ports. It's a dream when your hotel decides that you really need only one accessible outlet in the whole room. After that, it's all software: Want to read a book? Get the Kindle app for your computer or phone. Movies? Rent some before you go from Amazon or iTunes and watch them on the plane. Camera, calculator, voice recorder, translator, GPS unit? That's what your smartphone is for. The goal in travel -- and in life in general -- is to use the fewest objects with the greatest function. That's what Mr. Platinum Elite missed with his panoply of devices. The savviest user of tech is the one who doesn't look as if he's using any tech at all. PHOTOS: A packing list for the plugged-in traveler could include Asus's Zenbook, which has an 11.6-inch display and uses the Windows system; AKG's K390 NC headphones, which cut down on ambient noise in airplanes; Mophie's Juice Pack Reserve, below, a Zippo-size auxiliary battery for iPhones and iPods; and Belkin's Mini Surge Protector with USB Charger, bottom right, a powerstrip that has three outlets and two USB ports.; The camera function of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus smartphone, above.

201204,Corporate News: Huawei to Bolster Its R&D Spending,"SHENZHEN, China -- Huawei Technologies Co. will increase its research-and-development spending nearly 20% this year to $4.5 billion, as an industrywide price squeeze in its core telecommunications business prompts the company to expand other operations. The Chinese company said at an analyst meeting on Wednesday that it will look to increase its business in the faster-growing mobile-device and enterprise-network markets to meet a target of 15% to 20% revenue growth for this year. Huawei's revenue rose nearly 12% to 203.9 billion yuan ($32.3 billion) last year. The R&D goal marks a slowdown from 34% growth in 2011, but Huawei acting Chief Executive Eric Xu said the target is aggressive for a company that believes it has caught up with rivals technologically. ""Our research and development isn't conservative, but on the contrary aggressive,"" Mr. Xu said. ""If you look at our history in the past 20 years, we have been following the industry for our products. However, when it comes to today, in a lot of areas we don't have a benchmark or leader to follow."" Huawei is moving into businesses such as cellphones and computer-network gear. Mr. Xu said growth at the company's core business -- providing infrastructure equipment to telecommunications providers -- has slowed as providers have squeezed equipment companies. He added that he expects the trend to continue. At the same time, Huawei's other industries face their own competitive pressures. The company's growing number of higher-end smartphones increasingly compete with the likes of Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp., while its enterprise-network business competes with companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. In early April, Cisco CEO John Chambers identified Huawei as Cisco's toughest rival and added that the Chinese company doesn't always ""play by the rules"" in areas such as intellectual-property protection and computer security. At the analyst conference, Mr. Xu said ""we don't look at Cisco as our competitor, because the businesses that compete with Cisco head-on account for a small amount of our business revenue."" Analysts say the two companies are likely to compete more often over sales of networking equipment. Though Mr. Xu didn't indicate any concrete targets for the growth of the enterprise business, David He, president of marketing at Huawei's enterprise business, said the company is hoping to beat the roughly 57% revenue increase that it posted in the segment last year. Earlier this week, Huawei said its net profit fell 53% to 11.65 billion yuan last year amid the strong yuan and increased investment.

201204,Hynix posts third straight quarterly loss amid slump in memory chip prices,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - SK Hynix Inc., the world's second-largest memory chipmaker, reported its third straight quarterly loss Thursday as chip prices dropped amid competition from rival suppliers and tepid demand for personal computers. The company said in a statement it had a net loss of 271 billion won ($238 million) for the January-March quarter compared with a profit of 274 billion won a year earlier. Sales dropped 15 percent from a year earlier to 2.39 trillion won. Its quarterly operating loss was 260 billion won. ""The downturn trend of memory semiconductor prices lasted due to slow seasonal demand and intensified competition among suppliers in the market,"" Hynix said in a statement. The company, however, expects launches of new smartphones and tablet computers and stronger-than-expected demand for mobile devices from China to drive a rebound in the chip industry in the coming months. Prices of chips used in personal computers are expected to rise as new chip designs from Intel Corp. and demand for Ultrabooks -- laptop computers that are lighter and thinner than mainstream laptops -- will likely fuel sales, Hynix said. The price of memory chips for PCs had tumbled as much as half but began to pick up after Japan's Elpida Memory Inc. filed for bankruptcy in February, which raised the prospect of shortages. SK Hynix, which competes with Samsung Electronics Co. and Japan's Toshiba Corp. in the global memory chip market, made an initial offer to buy Elpida last month. It is now carrying out due diligence. In March, SK Hynix, formerly known as Hynix Semiconductor Inc., became part of South Korea's third-largest conglomerate SK Group after its SK Telecom Co. unit bought a 21 percent stake in the chipmaker. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,INSTANT VIEW 2-Samsung posts record $5.15 bln profit,"SEOUL, April 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co , the world's top technology firm by revenue, reported a record quarterly profit on Friday, powered by booming sales of its smartphones and the Galaxy Note phone/tablet. The South Korean firm reported January-March operating profit of 5.85 trillion won ($5.15 billion), broadly in line with its earlier estimate of 5.8 trillion won and nearly double the 2.95 trillion won a year ago.

201204,UPDATE 6-Galaxy phones power Samsung to record $5.2 bln profit,"* Q1 operating profit 5.85 trln won vs 5.8 trln won guidance * Handset profit at 4.27 trln won, margins jump * Chip profits more than halved to 760 bln won * Galaxy S 3 launch to boost earnings momentum - analysts * Samsung shares up 2.9 pct to life high (Adds context) By Miyoung Kim SEOUL, April 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics made a record $5.2 billion profit in the first quarter, overhauling Nokia as the world's top mobile phone seller, and its Galaxy smartphones outstripped Apple's iPhone at the high end of the market. The South Korean group's handset division shifted more than 20,000 Galaxy phones an hour in the quarter and contributed most of its operating profit. That company's shares hit a lifetime high after the results, pushing its market value to $190 billion, 11 times that of Japanese rival Sony, though still only a third of Apple's, the world's most valuable company. Samsung sold 93.5 million handsets in the quarter, more than one in every four sold, according to Strategy Analytics, toppling Nokia from the top spot after 14 years. The total included 44.5 million smartphones, giving Samsung a 30.6 percent share of the high-end market. Apple's sales of 35.1 million iPhones gave it a 24.1 percent share. ""Samsung and Apple are out-competing most major rivals, and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two-horse race,"" said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics. CLSA analyst Matt Evans said in a recent report that ""Samsung's smartphone success in the first quarter was the flip-side of Nokia's disappointment."" Nokia, which had long been the leader in the smartphone segment until last year, has suffered a sharp decline in sales since it abandoned its own smartphone operating system and switched to the largely untried Windows Phone. It managed to sell only 12 million smartphones in the first quarter. The near duopoly in high-end smartphones is unlikely to come under much threat this year or next, according to Bernstein analysts, and Samsung will look to keep that momentum going next week with the launch in London of a third generation of Galaxy S, hoping to boost sales ahead of the summer Olympics, where the group is among the leading sponsors. ""The Galaxy S 3's specifications are expected to be sensational, and it's already drawing strong interest from the market and consumers,"" said Brian Park, an analyst at Tong Yang Securities. The new Galaxy will be powered by Samsung's quad-core microprocessor, which the company hopes to see used in handsets sold by Nokia, HTC and Motorola, as well as Apple, its biggest customer for components. ""We anticipate very strong demand for the Galaxy S 3,"" Robert Yi, Samsung's senior vice president and head of investor relations, told analysts. ""When there's strong demand in the market, we don't necessarily need to spend a lot of marketing dollars to promote sales."" While Apple said this week that iPhone 4S sales boosted its quarterly revenue in China five-fold, there are more Samsung handsets than Apple phones in the world's biggest mobile market. Samsung said it increased its China smartphone market share to just above its global average, suggesting it took more than 30 percent share of a market where, unlike Apple, it already has deals with all three big telecoms operators. Samsung's quarterly handset division profits nearly tripled to 4.27 trillion won ($3.8 billion), accounting for 73 percent of total profit, and operating margins jumped to 18.4 percent from 12 percent in the preceding quarter on strong sales of the Galaxy S and the Note phone/tablet, the surprise consumer hit of recent months. MOBILE WARNING In a sign that high-end smartphones are where the mobile action, and money, is, Foxconn International Holdings warned of a deepening first-half loss on weak orders. While its Taiwanese parent assembles iPads and iPhones, Foxconn International mainly puts together handsets for Motorola, Sony and others, indicating a wider gulf between high-end smartphones and other mobile devices. Samsung, the world's top technology firm by revenue, is also outmuscling Japanese rivals in TVs and memory chips. January-March operating profit nearly doubled to 5.85 trillion won and was up from 5.3 trillion won in the previous quarter, sending Samsung shares to a life high of 1.38 million won ($1,200). The shares closed up 2.5 percent. Tong Yang's Park said Samsung's handset earnings growth may slow later this year, with the likely third-quarter launch of Apple's iPhone 5, ""but the recovery of chips and displays will more than offset potential drops, sustaining earnings momentum."" Samsung competes with Sony and LG Electronics in TVs, Toshiba and SK hynix in chips and LG Display in flat screens. THE CHIPS ARE DOWN Profits from semiconductor sales more than halved to 760 billion won, the lowest in nearly three years, hit by tumbling computer memory chip prices. T h e division also lost some production as Samsung converted a NAND memory chip line to system chips to meet growing demand for mobile processors. Samsung's TV and home appliance business boosted profits sharply to 530 billion won from a razor-thin 80 billion won a year ago, as it sold more high-end models such as its LED-backlit LCD flat-screen TVs and Internet-enabled sets. Samsung, the world's biggest TV maker, and local rival LG Electronics are among the few global TV manufacturers making money and winning market share on the back of sleek design, crisp displays and new technologies, such as 3D and organic light emitting display (OLED) sets. Sony, Panasonic and Sharp, Japan's top TV firms, expect to have lost a combined $21 billion in the business year just ended. Samsung will also merge its Samsung Display liquid crystal display (LCD) unit with its OLED production unit Samsung Mobile Display to create the world's biggest flat-screen producer. The new unit, which will also take in what is left of a dissolved LCD venture with Sony, will launch in July, and Samsung hopes it will shift focus from to OLED from LCD and maintain a lead over Japanese rivals. Samsung's OLED unit contributed around 400 billion won of profit in the first quarter, more than offsetting losses from the LCD operation.

201204,"UPDATE 1-TIM Brasil Q1 profit jumps, beating forecasts","* Brazil's fastest-growing carrier sees profit surge * Net income beats forecast; EBITDA in line (Adds details of earnings, background) SAO PAULO, April 26 (Reuters) - TIM Participacoes , Brazil's second-largest wireless phone company, posted a 30 percent rise in first-quarter profit, as its growing share of the country's booming mobile market delivered solid revenue growth. The Brazilian unit of Telecom Italia said in a Thursday securities filing that its first-quarter net income rose to 276.4 million reais ($146.3 million), beating a forecast of 263.2 million reais in a Reuters survey. The fastest-growing mobile carrier in Brazil, TIM expanded its user base 27 percent from a year earlier, tapping into Brazilians' growing budget for cell phones and mobile internet thanks to rising wages and record low unemployment. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, rose 13 percent to 1.129 billion reais, in line with a forecast of 1.15 billion reais. EBITDA equaled 26.2 percent of total revenue, a measure of profitability known as the EBITDA margin, slipping from 27.5 percent a year earlier. The tighter profit margin reflects the rising cost of growing market share in Brazil's hotly contested wireless market, where TIM and rivals have stepped up promotions to draw users. TIM has offered subsidized smartphone sales to convince customers to sign up for pricier data plans, adding lower-margin handset sales to its top line. Without the handset business, TIM said its EBITDA margin would have been stable from a year earlier. The galloping growth of TIM's user base, particularly for less expensive pre-paid services, dragged on other measures of profitability as well. The carrier's average revenue per user, an industry metric of profitability known as ARPU, slipped 8 percent from a year earlier. On a pro-forma basis, including the year-earlier results of broadband company AES Atimus, which TIM acquired in July, the company's consolidated net income rose 19 percent from the first quarter of 2011.

201204,"PREVIEW-Brazil telecom profits mixed, margins slipping","* Telefonica faces one-time costs of layoffs, rebranding * Mobile focus keeps TIM's revenue, profit growth strong * Industry profit margins slipping on stiffer competition * TIM reports first-quarter earnings later on Thursday By Sérgio Spagnuolo and Brad Haynes SAO PAULO, April 26 (Reuters) - Brazil's two biggest wireless carriers likely saw mixed results in the first quarter, as they paid a higher price to hold onto their share of a fast-growing and hotly contested mobile market. Phone company Telefonica Brasil likely saw profit slip from a year earlier due to the cost of integrating a major acquisition that made it Brazil's largest wireless operator. Telefonica's net income is expected to fall 13 percent to 1.13 billion reais, according to a Reuters survey of five analysts, due to the one-time cost of rebranding and cutting over 1,000 jobs. Revenue growth at fixed-and-wireless operator Telefonica is also expected to lag purely wireless carrier TIM Participacoes , its closest mobile rival, as Brazilians swap their landlines for cell phones in record numbers. ""Growth is still principally about exposure to the mobile segment,"" wrote HSBC Securities analysts led by Richard Dineen in a note to clients. Analysts expect TIM's robust subscriber and revenue growth to drive profit 24 percent higher to 263 million reais when it reports earnings later on Thursday. Telefonica Brasil, the local unit of Spain's Telefonica , reports earnings May 10. Both companies are likely to see profit margins suffer as they step up sales activities and promotions in the face of stiffening competition. Telefonica's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, may even slip slightly. The company's EBITDA as a share of net revenue, a measure of profitability known as the EBITDA margin, is expected to fall to 33.5 percent from 35.4 a year earlier. Itau BBA analysts said they expected costs of Telefonica's consolidation to pay off with better margins by year-end. The EBITDA margin for TIM, the Brazilian unit of Telecom Italia, is seen slipping to 26.0 percent from 27.5 percent a year ago. The blistering growth of Brazil's wireless market to 250 million connections by the end of March, up nearly 20 percent in a year, is also expected to drag on operators' average revenue per user, or ARPU, an industry metric of profitability. Still, carriers have focused on expanding wireless broadband use to offset slipping ARPU, and TIM has even subsidized smartphone sales to draw users to its pricier data plans. Rival phone company Grupo Oi is set to report financial results May 14, but analysts have held back from giving estimates for its earnings report since an overhaul of its corporate structure. Oi's margins are also likely to suffer as the company has launched a campaign to reverse its slipping fourth place share of Brazil's wireless market. The company plans to invest 6 billion reais annually from this year through 2015, up from a 5 billion reais investment in 2011. Following are the average first-quarter estimates of five analysts for Telefonica and TIM, expressed in reais unless otherwise noted:   (Reporting by Brad Haynes; Editing by Tim Dobbyn) TELECOM-BRAZIL/(PREVIEW) | ABN | E | RBN Reuters Limited Document LBA0000020120426e84q001wv ",Reuters News,27 April 2012,624 words,previewbrazil telecom profit mixed margin slipping,telefonica face onetime cost layoff rebranding mobile focus keep tims revenue profit growth strong industry margin slipping stiffer competition tim report firstquarter later thursday srgio spagnuolo brad haynes sao paulo april reuters brazil two biggest wireless carrier likely saw mixed result first quarter paid higher onto share fastgrowing hotly contested market phone company telefonica brasil year earlier due integrating major acquisition made largest operator telefonicas income expected fall percent billion reais according reuters survey five analyst rebranding cutting job fixedandwireless telefonica also lag purely tim participacoes closest brazilian swap landline cell record number still principally exposure segment wrote hsbc security led richard dineen note client tims robust subscriber drive reais thursday telefonica brasil local unit spain telefonica may suffer step sale activity promotion stiffening telefonicas interest tax depreciation amortization gauge operating known ebitda slightly ebitda profitability ebitda itau bba said telefonicas consolidation better yearend ebitda tim brazilian telecom italia seen ago blistering connection end march nearly drag average per user arpu metric focused expanding broadband use arpu tim subsidized smartphone pricier data plan grupo oi set financial held back since overhaul corporate structure ois launched reverse invest reais annually reais investment following firstquarter telefonica tim expressed reais unless otherwise noted reporting haynes editing tim dobbyn telecombrazilpreview abn e rbn reuters limited document lbaeqwv

A scramble by top chipmaker Intel Corp to stake out territory in the mobile market is being met by leading contract manufacturer TSMC Co Ltd and its customers' adoption of more challenging process technologies. ""Both of them are aiming for the mobility market and the result is a drive to come out with more powerful processing at lower power,"" Chief Executive Rick Wallace said in an interview. KLA-Tencor's results reinforced expectations of steady gear sales after top equipment maker ASML Holding NV said last week that demand was being driven by the need for more chips used in mobile devices. A delay, since resolved, in a large order limited KLA-Tencor's bookings in the quarter to $833 million, on the low end of its previous guidance, executives told analysts on a conference call. That helped dull earlier gains by the shares of KLA-Tencor, which provides systems that monitor and analyze chip production, but Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg was upbeat. ""Overall it was solid,"" he said. ""Good guidance above consensus, orders back up again and a strong outlook. There's not a whole lot to pick on."" On Thursday, TSMC said it would increase capital spending by up to some 16 percent this year to meet demand for chips made using its 28 nanometer process technologies. That drove up shares of KLA-Tencor and other gearmakers. Following economic uncertainty last year, spending by foundry and logic chipmakers on chip gear has risen as they implement new technology. But analysts expect spending from makers of NAND flash memory chips to remain soft due to oversupply. YIELD CHALLENGES TSMC's spending increase came partly as a response to unexpectedly strong demand from customers for high-end chips made using its new cutting-edge 28 nanometer process. Major TSMC-customer Qualcomm Inc this month said it could not get enough 28 nm chips, echoing comments from Nvidia Corp in February. Qualcomm and Nvidia both design chips for high-end smartphones. Wallace said contract manufacturers such as TSMC, which rapidly switch production between chips for different customers, need KLA-Tencor's test equipment much more than Intel, which changes its production less often. ""You've got to get it right, you can't tune it over time. So the adoption of our equipment is higher in those environments,"" Wallace said. Other big players in mobile chips are also spending more. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said in late January it would spend $13.3 billion on its semiconductor business this year and rival UMC forecast increasing orders and proclaimed an end to an inventory adjustment that has dogged the industry. U.S. chipmaker Intel said last week its sales would accelerate in the second half of the year with a powerful new PC processor and warned that costs associated with ramping up new production lines would hurt gross margins more than expected. The long-time technology bellwether's new Medfield processor has been adopted for a handful of phones this year. KLA-Tencor said quarterly revenue was $841 million, compared with $834 million in the year-ago quarter. For the current quarter it expects bookings, an indicator of future revenue, to be between $840 million and $900 million. Analysts were expecting third-quarter revenue of $802 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It said revenue in the current quarter would be in a range of $840 million to $900 million. Analysts had expected current-quarter revenue of $848 million. Third-quarter net income was $205 million, or $1.21 a share, versus $210 million, or $1.22 a share in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.27. The Milpitas, California company's shares dipped 0.4 percent in extended trading after closing 3.6 percent higher at $55.11.

201204,Canada seeks C$900 mln or more in spectrum auction,"* Rules set for anonymous bids to avoid collusion * Spectrum will be sold off in all-or-nothing packages * 700 MHz auction key to major network upgrades * Major carriers to spend at least C$1.5 mln each-analyst By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, April 26 (Reuters) - Canada aims to raise a minimum of nearly C$900 million through an auction of valuable wireless spectrum, based on ground rules published by the government th is week, t hough the sale could bring in far more as carriers vie for the frequencies. The online document spelling out the rules marks the start of a months-long consultation process that will bed down the finer points of an auction that will shape the wireless industry for years to come. The sale is scheduled for early next year. In selling the rights to low-frequency 700 MHz airwaves, Industry Canada, the agency in charge, wants to thwart criticism over how it handled a wireless auction in 2008. This time it plans to keep bids anonymous to reduce the potential for collusion. It will also offer packaged licenses to eliminate the risk that bidders will win some but not all the spectrum they desire. The 700 MHz frequencies - which travel longer distances and penetrate walls more easily than other spectrum - are compatible with a new mobile broadband technology known as long-term evolution. LTE is already being introduced into U.S. markets after an auction of the same spectrum four years ago. Some participants in a 2008 Canadian auction of higher-frequency airwaves have privately complained that Telus Corp and BCE Inc avoided bidding against each other as they could see the blocks the other was targeting. The two carriers later built a shared national network. That auction brought in C$4.25 billion ($4.32 billion) for the government. ""With the ""blind auction"" structure, it will be difficult for players to know that this harmonic situation is unfolding, and a combination of risk and greed could lead to extended bidding,"" TD Securities analyst Vince Valentini wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. He estimated BCE, Telus and Rogers Communications, the country's largest wireless operator, would each spend at least C$500 million in the auction. Newer entrants such as Globalive's Wind Mobile and Mobilicity would have to stump up at least C$159 million for minimum national coverage, he said. PRIME BLOCKS EYED Of the seven blocks available, bidders will likely covet four aligned with spectrum bought by AT&T and Verizon Wireless in the United States. Verizon is a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc. Those carriers hold more sway with device manufacturers and can push to ensure future smartphones and tablet computers work on those specific frequencies. The government has said BCE, Telus and Rogers can only obtain one of these prime blocks each, leaving the new entrants and regional cable operators such as Quebecor Inc and Shaw Communications Inc to compete for the fourth. The auction will use a ""combinatorial clock auction"" format which is expected to speed up the auction process. Bidders will, in subsequent rounds, offer a price for the packages of licenses they seek across 14 geographical areas of Canada. The regional blocks cover one or more pro vince or t erritory, wi th the more populous Ontario and Quebec each split into three. The model also encourages more transparent bidding from the very start. In the 2008 auction, new entrants that were able to bid on some airwaves declared off-limits to the incumbents were also able to bid in early rounds on other spectrum they did not need, artificially inflating the price others paid. Taken into account variations to the rules and minimum bidding prices in different regions of the country, Industry Canada said the total amount it expects to raise in opening bids for all spectrum blocks this time around is C$897.3 million. It set the most expensive minimum opening bid at C$69.3 million for southern Ontario, an area that includes Toronto, Canada's most populous city and its financial center. By contrast, a license for the three sparsely populated northern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut will start at C$284,000, it said. TD's Valentini said the rules allow BCE and Telus to extend their existing partnership. Shaw could buy spectrum to use as a bargaining chip for a future network-sharing deal with Rogers, he said. Shaw bought airwaves in 2008, but decided not to build out a cellular network.

201204,Smartphones to lift Samsung to record $5 bln profit,"* Samsung has forecast Q1 operating profit of 5.6-6.0 trln won * Handset profit margins seen around 20 pct * Set to end Nokia's 14-year reign as handset leader * Samsung shares up 27 pct YTD vs 7.6 pct gain on KOSPI By Miyoung Kim SEOUL, April 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top technology firm by revenue, will report record quarterly operating profit of around $5 billion later on Friday on soaring sales of its Galaxy smartphones and as South Korean firms outmuscle Japanese rivals in TVs and memory chips. Samsung, whose $184 billion market value is worth around a dozen Sonys , is set to topple Nokia as the global handset leader after 14 years, and its Android-based Galaxy line-up will have outsold Apple's iPhone as it won users from Nokia, Blackberry maker Research In Motion , Motorola and others. The South Korean firm, which last year sold close to one in every 5 smartphones worldwide, should build on that market leadership with the launch in London next week of a third generation of its flagship Galaxy S, backed by heavy marketing ahead of the summer Olympics. The new Galaxy will be powered by Samsung's quad-core microprocessor, which it hopes to see used in handsets sold by Nokia, HTC and Motorola, as well as Apple, its biggest customer. And, while Apple said this week that iPhone 4S sales boosted its quarterly revenue in China five-fold, there are more Samsung handsets than Apple phones in the world's biggest mobile market, said IDC analyst Wong Teck-Zhung in Beijing. Samsung - which has deals with all three of China's big telecoms operators - already pushed out Nokia as China's top smartphone vendor in the fourth quarter, with a near-25 percent market share, and analysts expect that to have increased as Nokia slips further. ""Samsung's smartphone success in the first quarter was the flip-side of Nokia's disappointment,"" Matt Evans, CLSA analyst said in a recent report. China's smartphone growth has defied most forecasts, and South Korean smartphone chip maker SK hynix this week predicted smartphone sales in China could be 20-30 percent higher than originally expected, given the level of orders it has seen. ""Overall Chinese demand was very strong in the first quarter and will drive global smartphone shipments to over 700 million this year,"" Kim Ji-bum, SK hynix head of global marketing and sales, told analysts on Thursday. Samsung, led by Chairman Lee Kun-hee, said earlier this month its quarterly operating profit will be 5.6-6.0 trillion won ($5.1 billion), close to double the year-ago quarter, and analysts predict handsets will bring in around two thirds of total profit. STRONG MARGINS Samsung is estimated to have sold some 90 million handsets, including 44 million smartphones, in January-March, beating Nokia's 83 million handsets, which included 12 million smartphones. Apple sold 35.1 million iPhones, which accounts for about half its revenue, in the March quarter. CLSA's Evans reckons each Galaxy S II sold generates about $135 of operating profit. ""The key will be how profitable Samsung's handset business was in the first quarter as they had strong sales with little marketing spend increase in the absence of major product releases,"" said Lee Sun-tae, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities, noting, however, that margins would come under pressure again as the new Galaxy launch will come with a hefty marketing budget. Analysts expect a near-20 percent operating margin from handsets thanks to strong sales of the Galaxy S II and the Note phone/tablet - Samsung's top-end model with a throwback stylus and 5.3-inch screen. ""But Samsung is reshuffling its product mix to drop feature phones and increase smartphone models. That'll limit the downside,"" added Lee. Samsung's home market remains its most lucrative as South Koreans buy high-end models and the company has a near-70 percent market share. Its smartphone operating margin in South Korea is around 38 percent, estimates CLSA, close to Apple's and nearly double the margin for Samsung's overall mobile business. Samsung competes with Sony and LG Electronics Inc in TVs, Toshiba and SK hynix in chips and LG Display in displays. Shares in Samsung have climbed 27 percent so far this year - hitting a life high of 1.351 million won ($1,200) earlier this month - far outperforming the benchmark index's 7.6 percent gain.

201204,DEALTALK-KPN Belgian sale hints at deeper retrenchment,"* KPN under pressure in home market of Netherlands * Private equity, cable op may bid for Belgium unit-sources * KPN to struggle to get high valuation for BASE-sources * E-Plus could be next on the block * Euro telcos weigh asset sales to defend home markets By Leila Abboud and Victoria Howley PARIS/LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - As KPN weighs whether to sell its Belgian subsidiary, in the background lies a deeper question: Whether the Dutch telecom operator and others in the industry will retrench further to focus on defending their home markets. Sources familiar with the company's plans say KPN is mulling a sell of BASE, Belgium's smallest operator, and wants 1.8 billion euros ($2.4 billion) for it. They believe E-Plus, the third German player, which analysts value at a much heftier 6 billion euros and is the subject of perennial takeover speculation, could be the next to go. Both assets were bought a decade ago, just as many of Europe's former state-owned monopolies, flush with ambition during the Internet bubble, planted flags far from home in debt-fuelled acquisition sprees. Today KPN and its telecom peers are under pressure to reverse the decline in revenues and profits brought about by the competition-boosting regulatory measures and the rise of device makers like Google and Apple, whose messaging apps allow users to avoid charges for voice and text. They also must invest heavily in networks to provide the extra capacity required to manage the smartphone and tablet revolution. That need for funds is leading some, such as Germany's Deutsche Telekom, Spain's Telefonica, and France Telecom to question, whether they can still afford their foreign empires at a time when they no longer have a growth story to tell investors, and so need to cut debt and protect dividends. Vodafone reaped roughly $25 billion by exiting France, Japan, China and Poland last year, while France Telecom left Switzerland and Austria with 1.67 billion euros. ""All these companies will have to retrench in order to deal with their debt burden and their need to invest in networks,"" said Robin Beinenstock, analyst at Bernstein Research. ""KPN probably has to sell something to be able to bid in domestic spectrum auctions this October and avoid a further credit rating downgrade."" With profits falling in its home market, KPN's debt ratios are creeping closer to its self-imposed ceiling of 2 .5 times EBITDA earnings, making it tougher for it to keep dividend pledges. Selling its Belgian arm would buy KPN a little time. An exit from Germany, a growing business that requires steep investments to keep up with larger rivals, would be a bolder move. KPN declined to comment on Thursday about a potential sale of E-Plus in Germany, but in February it said it was not a seller. The asset could interest Vodafone, the second biggest operator in Germany, or the smallest player there, Telefonica. KPN also reiterated its earlier statement that it was weighing options for BASE and had not decided on a sale. The decisions KPN and others large telecom companies make on whether to sell assets and at what price could alter the European telecom map in the coming years. It's also opening the door for cash-rich private equity firms to scoop up mobile businesses at nearly decade-low valuations, since there are often few strategic buyers for these companies. Private equity investors have a list of targets that reads like a who's who of distressed telecoms companies: Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom's joint venture in the UK, Deutsche Telekom's Dutch business, KPN's E-Plus, Telefonica's Ireland and Czech Republic subsidiaries. BELGIUM AUCTION Since KPN's announcement last week, potential bidders for BASE including cable operator Liberty Global's Telenet and private equity firms such as Bain, Apax and Providence have taken a closer look at the market, although no formal sale process has begun, said people familiar with the situation. Telecom tycoons such as France's Xavier Niel and Egypt's Naguib Sawiris have also been on the prowl for assets in Europe so may look at BASE. But KPN is unlikely to attract offers for BASE at valuations as high as those won by France Telecom when it touched off a bidding war among private equity funds before selling to Apax Partners for 1.6 billion euros. Multiple sources evaluating the potential process said BASE's operating margins were already quite high because of KPN's cost-conscious management, making the deal less attractive for private equity, which usually looks to buy cheaply and squeeze out extra efficiencies. They also pointed out that overall telecom sector valuations have fallen since the beginning of the year, with investors ascribing price-to-earnings ratios near 10-year lows. One person who tracks such deals predicted that France's Swiss sale would be the high point with valuations on similar divestments only going down from here. ""In France Telecom's Swiss unit there was a lot to be done, so private equity bidders could build an investment case around improving the branding, cutting costs on everything from information technology to stores, and expanding in German-speaking regions,"" said one source. ""But since BASE has been run as a low-cost operator it will be very difficult for private equity to create value."" In Switzerland, France Telecom's operating margins were around 28-29 percent last year, while BASE had margins of 35 percent. The sources also said some 30-40 million euros of investment would be needed to upgrade BASE's mobile network for mobile data use and compete with larger rivals Belgacom and Mobistar, which is majority-owned by France Telecom. On the positive side, the small Belgian mobile market is more profitable than Britain or Germany because operators don't usually subsidise mobiles for customers, analysts say. Plus since large majority of BASE's customer base consists of pre-paid users without long contracts, there is an opportunity to grow by targeting more high-end smartphone users. Nick Brown, an analyst at investment bank Espirito Santo, said it was hard to predict what KPN would accept in terms of price for BASE. ""I think the market would be disappointed if KPN was unable to sell BASE or sold it too cheaply,"" he said. ""We believe KPN's management would like to show investors that it knows how to exit its markets well, especially since a potential future sale of its German unit might be one attraction for the shares.""

201204,"Softbank Profit Surges On Subscriber Growth, iPhone","Softbank Corp. recorded a 65.4% surge in net profit for the fiscal year ended in March, as solid growth in subscriber numbers and iPhone demand helped the mobile carrier brush off the emergence of a rival domestic provider of Apple Inc.'s popular smartphone. But company president Masayoshi Son indicated this was no time for the company to rest on its laurels, setting out an ambitious growth target for fiscal 2016 and much higher dividend levels. Japan's third largest mobile carrier by subscriber numbers, said net profit for the 12 months ended March jumped to ¥313.76 billion from ¥189.71 billion in the previous year. It also reported a gain in operating profit to ¥675.28 billion from ¥629.16 billion, on revenue of ¥3.202 trillion, up 6.6% from¥3.005 trillion a year earlier. Softbank did not break out a net profit figure for the January-March quarter in its earnings release. A company spokesman said Softbank recorded net profit of ¥63.7 billion, compared with ¥47.4 billion last year. The results suggest Softbank has so far managed to fend off the emergence of KDDI Corp. as a rival provider of the iPhone 4S. Softbank set out a ¥1 trillion operating profit goal for the fiscal year ending in March 2017 and an eightfold increase in the dividend for the fiscal year just ended to ¥40 per share. ""I'm not satisfied (even) with this level"" of dividends, Son told reporters, though he added he would make no numerical commitment for the future. ""But at least I want to continue at this level,"" he said. ""In the medium- to long-term, I'm still not satisfied."" The Tokyo-based company, one of Asia's biggest Internet companies with large holdings in Yahoo Japan Corp. and China's Alibaba group, has seen earnings grow in recent years on the back of widespread demand for the iPhone and other Apple products. The hit smartphone has helped Softbank win new customers and, like other data-intensive smartphones, it generates higher revenue. The company's average revenue per user, or ARPU, in the data transmission segment for the fiscal year rose to ¥2,510 from ¥2,310 a year earlier, propelled by the growth in iPhone users. The overall ARPU including revenue from voice communication services slid to ¥4,150 from ¥4,210. Softbank embarked on an aggressive sales campaign that saw its net growth in subscriber numbers stay ahead of rival KDDI in the month after the launch of the iPhone 4S. Apart from in January, Softbank has continued to see a larger monthly net increase in subscribers than its competitor. Softbank said it added a net 3.54 million subscribers during the fiscal year, compared with 2.12 million for market leader NTT Docomo Inc. and 2.11 million for KDDI's au service. Softbank cited the rise in subscribers as one of the main engines of revenue growth along with sales of the iPhone 4S. Looking ahead, the company suggested an additional driver of net subscriber growth would come in the form of a new service band Softbank will start using later in the year. In March, Softbank was allocated a new 900MHz Platinum Band for its mobile network that it says will enable more efficient and wider coverage of its phones compared with its existing service. The firm cited a survey suggesting a 30% increase in users looking to switch from other carriers to Softbank after the benefits of the new band were explained. Son said the company has ""far exceeded"" its goals set in 2008 at the time of the global financial crisis of achieving ¥1 trillion in free cash flow and halving its interest-bearing debt, which it had planned to continue cutting to zero and had set as its most important financial objective. ""During that time, many shareholders and financial institutions pointed out whether it was really the most desirable thing to eliminate it (interest-bearing debt),"" he said. The company changed course and now is seeking a balance among the three areas of reducing interest-bearing debt, returning value to shareholders and pursuing growth strategy, he said. Softbank didn't provide an earnings forecast for the full fiscal year, in line with its usual practice. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Nintendo Records $531.1 Million Annual Loss,"TOKYO—Nintendo Co. posted its first annual loss in more than three decades, dragged down by the strong yen and price cuts for the company's Wii game console and 3DS hand-held system. While competing with online social games and less-expensive titles on smartphones and tablet computers, Nintendo also is revamping its portable and home machines to keep pace with Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Nintendo plans to debut a new home console, the Wii U, this year. Nintendo on Thursday reported a net loss of ¥43.2 billion ($531.1 million) in the fiscal year ended March 31, compared with a profit of ¥77.62 billion a year earlier. The Kyoto, Japan, company recorded an operating loss of ¥37.32 billion for the latest year. Revenue fell 36% to ¥647.65 billion. Nintendo doesn't break out its quarterly results. When the Nintendo 3DS, a successor to the DS hand-held device, entered the market to a lukewarm reception last year, the company slashed the price 40% and sold the machine at a loss to stimulate sales. The 3DS plays 3-D games without the need for special glasses. To lure buyers to the 3DS, the company said it plans to introduce a new version of ""Super Mario Bros."" in August, along with a new installment in the popular ""Brain Age"" series that tests memory and concentration by the summer. Nintendo said it sold 13.53 million 3DS units in the past fiscal year and expects to sell 18.5 million units this year. ""Nintendo expects to cease selling [the 3DS] below cost by the middle of the fiscal year,"" the company said Thursday. Expecting that it can halt hardware losses on the 3DS, Nintendo forecast a net profit of ¥20 billion and an operating profit of ¥35 billion on revenue of ¥820 billion for the current fiscal year. The forecasts were slightly below what analysts had predicted. Sales of the Wii continued to taper off in the past fiscal year ahead of the arrival of its successor. Nintendo said it sold 9.84 million units of the Wii in the past fiscal year, down 35%. Nintendo forecast selling 10.5 million Wii units, including the new Wii U, this year. The Wii U will introduce high-definition graphics. But its main new feature will be a touch-screen controller with a 6.2-inch screen between the traditional game-control buttons, allowing the player to see an aspect of the game that is different than what appears on the television screen. The Wii controller also will have an accelerometer and gyroscope to respond to motion like the original Wii's wand controllers. It also comes with a built-in camera and microphone. Nintendo on Thursday confirmed the Wii U's release schedule, saying it will ""propose a new play style of home entertainment."" Nintendo's results also were dragged down by the strong yen. The company keeps much of its cash in foreign currencies, so a stronger yen amplifies paper losses on its reserves when converted into the Japanese currency. A strong yen also makes Japanese-made products more expensive overseas. The dollar reached a low of ¥75.31 on Oct. 31. It fetched ¥81.34 late Wednesday in New York. Nintendo projected the dollar trading at ¥80 and the euro at ¥105 for the current fiscal year. Write to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,SK Hynix Swings to Loss,"SEOUL—SK Hynix Inc. said Thursday it swung to a first-quarter net loss as oversupply and weak demand for personal computers continued to put pressure on memory chip prices and squeezed the company's bottom line. However, SK Hynix, the world's second-largest computer memory chip maker by revenue after Samsung Electronics Co., expects the industry to recover as demand for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, remains strong, and as growth in the market for ultra-thin personal computers drives sales of memory chips. ""PC (dynamic random access memory) chip prices have been on the rise recently as major customers were worried about supply in the second half of the year following the bankruptcy (of Elpida),"" Kim Joon-ho, head of SK Hynix's corporate center, told investors on an earnings conference call. However, the Korean company added recent declines in NAND flash memory chips will persist throughout the current quarter owing to a supply glut. For the three months ended March 31, SK Hynix posted a net loss of 271.2 billion won ($237.6 million), compared with a net profit of 274 billion won a year earlier. The result was worse than the average forecast for a net loss of 191.6 billion won from five analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires. Sales fell 15% to 2.388 trillion won from 2.793 trillion won. It is SK Hynix's third consecutive quarterly loss, underscoring the industry-wide downturn that contributed to the bankruptcy of Japan's Elpida MemoryInc. in February. In March, the Korean chipmaker submitted a preliminary bid proposal for Elpida but added Thursday it hasn't decided if it will proceed. Analysts are optimistic that SK Hynix will recover from the second quarter due to restocking demand from set makers for chips ahead of the traditionally busier season for electronics makers in the latter part of the year. SK Hynix is also expected to be a beneficiary of Elpida's demise, as some clients of the Japanese chipmaker transfer their orders to the South Korean firm. ""From the second quarter, the Elpida effect will likely be reflected in Hynix's earnings because shipments to new customers will have kicked off, while DRAM prices are also expected to rise after May, driven by the overall industry recovery,"" said Tong Yang Securities' analyst Brian Park. Mr. Park expects SK Hynix's second-quarter operating profit at 258.9 billion won. The company posted an operating loss of 260 billion won in the first quarter, compared with a 322.8 billion won profit a year earlier. In March, SK Hynix Chief Executive O.C. Kwon said the chip industry is set to recover from the second half of this year, partly helped by rebounding dynamic random access memory chip prices following Elpida's bankruptcy. The average selling price of Hynix's DRAM chips in the first quarter fell 10% from the previous quarter, while that of its NAND flash memory chips fell 16% from the prior quarter, the company said.

201204,On the Call: Amazon CFO Tom Szkutak talks about hot-selling Kindle Fire,"It's hard to miss the Kindle Fire, either on the Amazon.com home page or in the company's first-quarter earnings results. The hot-selling tablet computer grabbed more than half the U.S. market for Android-based tablet computers in February, according to tracking company comScore Inc. It also helped boost North American media sales -- which includes TV show streams and downloads -- by 17 percent to $2.2 billion. That's more than twice the segment's 8 percent gain in the quarter through December. It may have helped Amazon exceed first-quarter profit forecasts. Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak was asked about the Kindle Fire, which is seen as a distant-second competitor to Apple Inc.'s iPad. The company never says how many Kindles it has sold. QUESTION: If you can maybe just talk about any of the traction you're seeing within Kindle Fire more broadly or maybe any more thoughts you have around a Kindle smartphone, that would be great. SZKUTAK: In terms of the Kindle Fire, we're pleased with the growth that we're seeing, and customers are buying a lot of content. You're seeing that when you look at, particularly ... our North American media growth from (the fourth quarter) to (the first quarter). ... So we're very pleased with what's happening.

201204,"A look at how selected chipmakers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: April 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC estimate that PC shipments in the first quarter were ahead of their expectations, though growth was modest in light of competition from smartphones and tablet computers. Hewlett-Packard Co. appeared to have regained some of the business it had lost as it was weighing whether to dump its PC business. Lenovo Group Ltd. showed strong gains over last year. Dell Inc.'s market share fell as it focused on higher-end, higher-profit machines. April 17: IBM Corp. reports flat revenue, falling short of analysts' expectations. Software and services revenue grew, but IBM's hardware and financing segments saw a decline. Intel Corp. reports first-quarter results that were held back by a shortage of hard drives, which meant that PC makers had to curb production and needed fewer Intel chips. The scarcity was caused by flooding of hard-drive factories in Thailand last year. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology PLC reports that its earnings in the latest quarter surged and revenue almost doubled. CEO Steve Luczo says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. But Seagate says it also shifted its product line to ""industry-leading products"" across all of its markets. April 18: Strong demand boosted revenue at Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs says the company benefited from growing global demand for new 3G- and 4G-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. But he says the cost of making more 28 nanometer chips could cut into profit margins in upcoming months. April 19: Microsoft Corp. reports a surprise rise in sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers. Analysts had assumed that many businesses and consumers thinking about buying a PC would hold off until Windows 8 hits the market in the fall. That didn't turn out to be the case as revenue in the Windows division increased 4 percent in the latest quarter. EMC Corp., one of the world's largest makers of data-storage computers, says first-quarter earnings jumped 23 percent, boosted by increased demand for its cloud computing products. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. says its computing solutions unit had flat revenue, while the graphics segment saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue because of lower demand for desktop and mobile graphics. SanDisk Corp., a maker of flash memory, says quarterly earnings sank by almost half amid weak demand and low selling prices -- trends the company expects will continue in the current quarter. The company says it expects demand to rise, but not until the second half of 2012. Altera Corp., a semiconductor maker, reports weak results it attributes to lighter-than-expected demand for its products, particularly from customers in the communications industry. In addition, the company said it had some issues trying to fill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. The company expects its business to rebound in the second quarter and says its backlog has significantly improved since the end of the quarter on stronger demand for its products. Monday: Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. says the business cycle ""bottomed"" in the first quarter. Orders rose 13 percent. CEO Rich Templeton says 2012 will be ""a good year for growth."" Xerox Corp. says revenue from its services business grew, while technology revenue, such as sales of document systems and supplies, declined. Services now make up more than half the company's revenue. Tuesday: Apple Inc.'s Mac sales for the quarter came in slightly below expectations, at 4 million. But Apple once again reported blowout iPhone sales, along with iPad sales that were two and a half times what it sold a year earlier. The relative strength of iPhone sales means they accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent. Wednesday: Business software maker SAP AG says net income rose 10 percent in the first quarter. It cited strong sales momentum for its high-speed HANA data platform and cloud-computing acquisition SuccessFactors.

Nokia Corp. says sales of smartphones dropped to 12 million in the first quarter, from 24 million a year earlier, while volume sales of cellphones fell to 83 million from 108 million a year earlier. Tuesday: Apple Inc. says it sold 35 million iPhones in the quarter, almost twice as many as it sold a year ago and above analyst expectations. IPad sales came in below analyst expectations, at 11.8 million units. But that was still two and a half times as many as it sold in the same quarter a year ago. Mac sales were also slightly below expectations, at 4 million. That was 7 percent more than a year ago. Apple sold 7.7 million iPods, down 15 percent from a year earlier. AT&T Inc. says it activated 4.3 million iPhones in the first quarter. That was down from 7.6 million in the fourth quarter, when AT&T began selling the iPhone 4S. However, the number was still up from the 3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold in the same quarter a year ago. HTC Corp. reports a drop in first-quarter earnings and revenue as it faces competition from Apple and Samsung, but it expects revenue to rise in the current quarter with its ""HTC One"" series phone that offers users a better camera and music experience in addition to a sleek design.

201204,UPDATE 2-Nintendo faces hard choices for a soft landing,"* Nintendo reports first annual operating loss of 37.3 bln yen * Expects to rebound to 35 bln yen operating profit this year * Forecasts 3DS handheld sales of 18.5 mln this business year * Expects to sell 10.5 mln Wii consoles (Recasts throughout, adds company comment) By Tim Kelly TOKYO, April 26 (Reuters) - In 2006 Nintendo took video gaming out of the kids' room and into the living room, as its hit Wii created a new niche as the console the whole family could share. But with that Wii boom waning, the successor being prepared by the creator of Super Mario looks like a losing proposition as Apple Inc and other smartphone and tablet makers take gaming to the bathroom, the commuter bus and back to the bedroom. Nintendo reported on Thursday its first ever operating loss with a deficit of 37.3 billion yen ($458 million) for the business year just ended, just marginally better than the consensus forecast for a 41.4 billion yen loss. ""They have been beaten by smartphones and tablets, in particular, for consumers spending and, more importantly, time,"" David Gibson, an analyst for Macquarie in Tokyo said before the results announcement. The company, which began in 1889 making playing cards in the back streets of Kyoto, has been hammered by a precipitous drop-off in sales of its Wii, DS handheld console and its new 3DS version. A year ago Nintendo expected to sell 13 million Wii consoles and ended up selling 9.8 million. It had a target for 16 million for its new 3DS handhelds but ended up offloading only 13.5 million last business year. It managed to shift only half the 11 million DS machines it wanted to sell. Weak demand forced Nintendo to slash the price of the new 3DS by about a third in August following its launch six months earlier. For the current business term Nintendo is aiming to sell 18.5 million of the devices. NEW WII Later this year the company is expected to release its successor to the Wii, the Wii U, which features a tablet controller. Forecasting a return to profit this business term, helped in part by a weakening yen that is boosting repatriated overseas revenue, Nintendo's boss, Satoru Iwata, acknowledged his company's lacklustre performance. ""Our target this year is not one I am satisfied with,"" he said at a briefing in Osaka, in western Japan. ""Sales of the 3DS in Europe have not been as buoyant as those in Japan,"" he added. Iwata, however, did not offer any strategic rethink or discuss any possible change to plans for the Wii U. Yet what Nintendo faces is a fundamental shift in gaming habits that analysts argue may require it to shrink its hardware business and instead chase profits for Super Mario and other game titles on devices built by other firms. Its emerging foe is Apple, already the nemesis of flagging Japanese titan Sony Corp, whose seamless go-anywhere devices - the iPhone, iPad and rumoured plans for a games controller and ""iTV"" - are positioning it to grab swathes of the gaming market where Nintendo once held sway. In a report this month, Macquarie's Gibson pointed to a recent survey by mobile gaming site MocoSpace. It asked 15,000 gamers where they gamed; 53 percent said they played in bed, 41 percent in the living room, 72 percent commuting and 5 percent on the toilet. Yet a game started on a Wii can't be continued on a DS on the way to work or school. The Wii U, slated to go on sale in time for the year-end shopping season, does not address that convergence hurdle. Nintendo will have to sell the new console for as much as $350 to break even, estimates Nanako Imazu, an analyst for CLSA in Tokyo. That is $100 more than it charged for the Wii in 2006 and would outstrip both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which can be picked up for less than $300. BACK IN THE BLACK Imazu said Nintendo, which earns about four-fifths of its revenue overseas, should also get a boost this business term the launch of popular game titles including Mario Party 8 and the latest instalment of Dragon Quest from Square Enix due out in August. For the year starting April 1, Nintendo expects operating profit of 35 billion yen, compared with a consensus estimate of a 40 billion yen profit based on forecasts by 20 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Nintendo will also likely have a year's grace to woo core gamers to the Wii U, say analysts, before Sony's anticipated launch of its PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's updated Xbox at the end of 2013. Nintendo, nonetheless, will still have to contend with the rising flood of smartphones and iPhones. ""Nintendo has to deal with the change and let Mario games be played on non-Nintendo devices,"" said Imazu. ""I think it will take at least couple of years to see that."" Any drastic strategy shift that would dispatch the Mario brothers into the realm of Android and Apple's iOS operating system would likely require a change at the top of Nintendo, said Macquarie's Gibson. And that likely won't happen for a couple of years until the Wii U is shown to be a clear failure, he added. Unlike money-losing Sony, where time is running out to counter the pounding it's getting from Apple and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, Nintendo, sitting on oodles of cash it made selling the Wii - about $14 billion - at least has time to mull its choices. ""With its 8,000 yen a share in cash, it can afford to still make a bet that its hardware will sell,"" said Gibson.

201204,UPDATE 1-Gemalto Q1 sales rise on mobile momentum,"* Q1 sales up 9 pct to 483 mln euros * Confirms FY outlook * Confirms target of 300 mln eur in op profit in 2013 * Mobile division sales up 11 pct (Updates with CEO comments, share price, details) PARIS, April 26 (Reuters) - Smart card maker Gemalto posted a 9 percent rise in first-quarter sales on Thursday on the back of strong momentum for higher-end mobile products and services and the strongest-ever contract bookings in its security division. Gemalto, which develops the security software embedded in chips for mobile phones and payment cards, said it was on its way towards its target of 300 million euros in operating profit in 2013. Quarterly revenue was 483 million ($636.78 million). Sales at its mobile division - which brings in close to half of revenue - rose 11 percent, driven by projects in Near Field Communications (NFC), the technology found in smartphones for contactless payments, and fourth-generation networks. ""We have a very good evolution of the product mix towards the high range,"" Chief Executive Olivier Piou told Reuters. ""Both our high-end and new products have done very well. But if you look at countries with lower-end products, such as India, there is a lot less volume there."" Piou said he expected sales in its mobile unit to grow by a high single-digit percentage over the full year. Gemalto has diversified into the security business in recent years, with a focus on payment technologies and identity management, away from its once core activity of making SIM cards for mobiles, seen under threat from Chinese chipmakers. Piou said the company did not face much competition in its mobile business from Chinese companies as they had taken a share of the lower-end of the SIM card market while it had focused on value-added products. With more than 10,000 staff, Gemalto competes against Germany's Giesecke & Devrient in its secure travel documents and mobile payment business as well as companies such as Morpho, a unit of Safran, Oberthur Technologies and WatchData. Its security division, which makes electronic passports, driving licences and health cards for the public sector, experienced its strongest quarterly order intake during the first quarter, bringing in several years worth of sales, Piou said. ""Many governments have understood that the digital economy and the deployment of electronic identity programmes were very important for development in the 21st century and to achieve economic growth,"" he said, adding that it would continue to post double-digit growth in 2012. The Paris-listed group reiterated its outlook for an increase in sales and operating profit in all of its divisions in 2012, although its patents business was still affected by the ongoing litigation with Google in the U.S. Shares of the company were up 2.1 percent at 54.54 euros at 1123 GMT, valuing it at 4.8 billion euros.

201204,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-TSMC lifts 2012 capex in latest sign of chip rebound,"(Corrects capex figure, pct change in first and second paragraphs) * TSMC Q1 net profit beats forecasts * To hike spending up to some 16 pct this year * Sees Q2 revenue at record high By Argin Chang TAIPEI, April 26 (Reuters) - TSMC, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, will increase capital spending by up to some 16 percent this year, joining South Korean rivals in beefing up operations in the latest sign of optimism among global chipmakers. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's (TSMC) said on Thursday it plans to spend between $8 billion and $8.5 billion this year, compared to the $6 billion planned at the beginning of the year and $7.3 billion spent last year. The latest show of optimism comes after Samsung Electronics said in late January it would spend $13.3 billion on its semiconductor business this year, and local rival UMC forecast increasing orders and proclaimed an end to the inventory adjustment that has dogged the industry. ""TSMC has stated that the added capex will be used on 28nm and 20nm expansion and we believe is in response to customers demand exceeding its initial conservative build plan,"" said CS analyst Randy Abrams in a recent report. ""2012 is better for foundries as product cycles are driven by both high-end and low cost smartphones and better PC drivers into 2H12, alongside inventory restocking versus destocking in 2011,"" the report said. Last week top chipmaker Intel Corp posted earnings confirming the PC industry is alive, and said sales would accelerate in the second half. Texas Instruments Inc, meanwhile, has forecast second-quarter revenue growth ahead of Wall Street estimates, signaling the end of a prolonged inventory-related decline in demand. Industry research firm IHS revised up on Wednesday its forecast for 2012 global semiconductor revenue growth, prompted by strong demand for products like cellphones and tablets. It now sees revenue reaching $324.6 billion, up 4.3 percent from 2011. It also previously forecast that revenue for foundries like TSMC would grow 12 percent to $29.6 billion. ""ENCOURAGING AND EXCITING"" ""The news in the last quarter has ranged from encouraging to exciting,"" TSMC Chairman Morris Chang told a results briefing on Thursday. ""Encouraging was macroeconomic news from the U.S. and China, which is our largest end market. And also encouraging is the world semiconductor trend, which now looks like it will exceed our earlier forecast of 2 percent growth from last year."" He described incoming orders in the first quarter as ""stronger than we expected."" TSMC said net profit in January-March was T$33.474 billion ($1.14 billion), above the T$29.7 billion average estimate of 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This compared to a profit of T$36.3 billion in the same period a year ago and T$31.58 in the previous quarter. It was the second successive quarterly rise in profit after declines from a record T$46.9 billion in the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2011. It forecast revenue in the second quarter of T$126 billion to T$128 billion, above a consensus analyst forecast of around T$117.5 billion and a record high. TSMC supplies chips to clients including Texas Instruments and Nvidia. UMC reported on Wednesday a first-quarter net profit that beat forecasts.

201204,"REFILE-ANALYSIS-Still in the frame, the camera defies smartphone onslaught","(Corrects company affiliation of NPD's Liz Cutting) By Jeremy Wagstaff, Asia chief technology correspondent SINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - While most attention in the gadget world is on the breakneck pace of innovation in mobile phones, tablets and computers, another device has resolutely refused to die: the camera. Despite the onslaught of camera phones - the iPhone 4 has this year become the most popular device for posting snaps to the photo-sharing website Flickr - cameras are still being sold. Japan, the world's largest manufacturer, shipped nearly three times as many cameras in January as it did in the same month of 2003, when the camera phone was still in its infancy. ""For several years, it has been predicted that smartphone adoption would cut into digital camera sales,"" said Prashant Malaviya, Associate Professor of Marketing at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. ""In fact, the exact opposite has happened."" Driving this is a number of factors, analysts and enthusiasts say. And, while most point to a continuing role for cameras for both professional and personal users, the device's future is far from assured. Firstly, photography is personal. We may be happy taking snaps with our cellphone or simple point-and-shoot camera, but it turns out that most of us won't entrust key memories to such basic devices. Surveys by NPD Group last November show that while more than a quarter of all American photos were taken by a smartphone, more people were buying cameras with detachable lenses or cameras with optical zooms of 10x or more. This, says NPD Group senior digital imaging analyst Liz Cutting, is because those people taking important family photos don't want to trust them to a device that isn't up to the task. ""Camera photography is certainly not dead,"" said Cutting. ""We're just seeing a skewing towards what the smartphone can't deliver. People are recognising that and are going for a higher end camera."" This in turn benefits the established players, because users are reluctant to entrust their photos to an untested brand. We may be ready to try out a new brand of cellphone, laptop or TV, but when it comes to family snaps we're more conservative. ""It's part of who you are, showing the kind of brand of camera you have,"" Cutting said. ""But it's also trusting the quality of that memory because that's how you remember your life."" This has helped entrench several key players, some of whom have dominated the scene for a generation or more - Canon Inc , Nikon Corp, Sony Corp, Olympus Corp , Pentax, Fuji and Panasonic Corp . CANON FODDER Canon has been one of the main beneficiaries of this, maintaining a strong brand from the professional high end to the point-and-shoot bottom, says Christopher Chute, global imaging chief at International Data Corp. Canon has seen its camera business grow as the proportion of its overall sales to more than 25 percent in 2008 from below 11 percent in 1999. In a survey of more than a quarter of a million users of Ontario-based gadget website Sortable.com, Canon was the most popular brand, with a third of the vote. Not that its rivals are standing idle. Panasonic, Olympus, Pentax and Nikon have in the past few years launched a new kind of camera that matches the quality of lenses of a professional model with the sleek, light body of a pocket, point-and-shoot device. Although these mirrorless cameras aren't a lot cheaper than the professional digital single lens reflex (DSLR) model, they are lighter and more compact. This has won them fans among both those trading up and those looking to replace or supplement their professional gear. Ong Hock Chuan, a hobbyist who runs a Jakarta public relations company, recently sold his heavier Canon EOS 50D for a mirrorless Sony NEX-7. Price wasn't a factor. ""I was tired of lugging around an SLR and getting a hernia for it,"" he said. Canon has yet to announce a mirrorless model. Not only are camera manufacturers seeking an edge over each other: They're battling the encroachment of camera phones on to their territory. At the bottom, Nokia and other mobile manufacturers have long partnered with lens makers like Carl Zeiss to improve the quality of photographs and phones, a trend which has meant many mobile phones now do a better job of a point-and-shoot camera. The appeal of the camera phone has also grown as social media services like Facebook make it possible to share a photo with friends and family as soon as it's taken. This leaves the compact point-and-shoot camera segment of the market vulnerable. In markets such as the United States and Japan, says Japan-based IHS analyst Kun Soo Lee, there's not many more people who want to buy one. On the one hand, this is eating into sales that Canon and others traditionally dominated. On the other, the ease with which photos can be taken on a phone is feeding an interest in taking better photos, expanding the middle of the market into a ""pro-sumer"" segment of devices which cost a bit more but offer the user options so far unavailable on the mobile phone: An optical, rather than digital, zoom, for example, better flash, and image stabilization. CANNIBALISATION, INNOVATION This is driving manufacturers to push more and better technology from their upper end models into cheaper devices. Prices have fallen dramatically in the past decade, says Mark Walters of U.S.-based website TechBargains.com. Ten years ago a 3-megapixel DSLR camera would cost $3,000; now a better quality 18-megapixel DSLR can be found for less than $500. ""The technology that has trickled down into the more consumer-targeted DSLRs is incredible,"" he said. Lowering prices and raiding the technologies of formerly professional models is not without danger. ""This pricing strategy has certainly caused some cannibalization of sales at the higher end for the likes of Canon and Nikon,"" said Walters, ""but they make up for it with volume at the low end by selling more critical accessories like lenses and flashes."" Manufacturers are also competing through innovation. Apart from mirrorless cameras, there have been improvements in sensors and a technology called high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, which layers images at different exposures. ""There's an amazing amount of innovation in digital photography equipment at the moment,"" said Melbourne-based Sydney Low, a former Internet entrepreneur who now takes sports photos for a living. ""More so in many ways than Apple, HP and other computer manufacturers."" While enthusiasts like Low believe that still cameras will eventually be replaced by video cameras - from which scenes can be grabbed - others believe that eventually mobile phone and camera will start to look and feel more like each other. A range of cameras launched in the past few months, said NPD In-Stat's Cutting, have for the first time included WiFi chips, making it possible for users to share their photos much as a smartphone user might. ""It has to be easy, and we haven't hit that yet,"" she said. Just as the camera gets smaller and more sociable, so will the mobile phone evolve to incorporate features presently only available on a camera. IHS's Kun said the introduction of 12 megapixel cameras into smartphones, for example, is a ""kicker to change the market."" Then, said J. Gerry Purdy of cellphone analysts MobileTrax, there's Polaroid's SC1630, announced in January and due to be launched this year: an Android device with an optical zoom. These and other innovations, Purdy said, may usher in a future where a smartphone camera ""will perform as well as today's digital cameras with large optical zoom and larger lenses."" California-based Pelican Imaging Corp, for example, promises a camera that will improve image and video quality while allowing for thinner smartphones. How traditional players react to these challenges is unclear.

201204,Smartphone Maker HTC Losing Grip on U.S. Market,"TAIPEI -- Smartphone maker HTC Corp., warning that it may have permanently lost its grip on the U.S. market, said its sales and profitability will fall this quarter amid tougher competition. The Taiwan-based company built a U.S. following by being one of the first to sell smartphones powered by Google Inc.'s Android operating system. It was the top seller of Android-based smartphones in the U.S. in 2010, with a market share of 11.8%, but lost the top spot to Samsung Electronics this year. Chief Executive Peter Chou said strong competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4S in the U.S. has hurt HTC's earnings in the past two quarters. ""It's difficult to recover our market share in the U.S.,"" Mr. Chou said in an online forum Tuesday. ""We will have more balanced growth in different markets this year."" HTC didn't disclose its revenue breakdown by region, but analysts said the U.S. accounted for about half of the company's revenue last year and about 40% of HTC's smartphone shipments. The U.S. won't be HTC's largest market this year, as the company aims to increase its presence in Asia and Europe, Mr. Chou said. The company, which started out as a contract manufacturer and began to make phones under its own brand in 2006, forecast second-quarter revenue of around 105 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$3.56 billion), down from NT$124.4 billion a year earlier, but recovering from NT$67.79 billion in the first quarter. The company projected second-quarter gross profit margin of 27%, compared with 28.8% a year earlier. HTC's first-quarter margin was 25%. ""We are confident in the company's future,"" Mr. Chou said Tuesday. ""We have seen encouraging growth momentum in the second quarter."" HTC reported this month that its first-quarter earnings slumped 70% from a year earlier to the company's lowest quarterly profit since 2006. While Apple and Samsung have been increasing their market share, emerging Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. have been offering more smartphones with advanced features at low prices. That has put additional pressure on HTC and other rivals that lack the cachet of Apple and Samsung. Apple and Samsung together held nearly half of the world's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Gartner, with Apple at 23.8% and Samsung at 22.6%. HTC's share stood at 7.2%. Mr. Chou said the company plans ""substantial"" marketing expenses in the second quarter to strengthen its brand image. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Google Tests Smartphone Direct Sales,"Google Inc. on Tuesday began selling a smartphone directly to consumers through its online store, a revival of a strategy that could be a prelude to direct sales of other devices such as tablets. The Internet company began selling the Galaxy Nexus, made by Samsung Electronics Co., for $399 through its Google Play store. The handset, one of many rivals to Apple Inc.'s hit iPhone, is unlocked -- meaning it doesn't come with a wireless contract and can work on multiple carrier networks. People can insert a working AT&T Inc. or T-Mobile SIM card to obtain wireless service for the device, which runs the latest version of Google's Android operating system and includes its Chrome mobile-Web browser. The same phone is available for around $200 for anyone signing a two-year contract with Verizon Wireless or SprintNextel Corp. Google said it was opening a new ""devices"" section of the Google Play store, which was formerly called Android market and sells apps and digital media. The move comes two years after Google abandoned efforts to sell an earlier smartphone directly to consumers online. Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google was preparing to sell tablet computers directly to consumers through an online store, as the company has been frustrated with sales of such devices by wireless carriers and other stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Android is the No. 1 smartphone operating system but lags far behind the iPad in the tablet market. More than 300 million Android devices have been activated, the company said Tuesday. Google licenses Android software free to hardware makers like Samsung, HTC and Sony Mobile, letting them build hardware around it. Google generates revenue through the sale of ad space on mobile websites, including its search engine, and mobile apps. It also generates some revenue through sales of some mobile apps and digital media such as books, music and movies through its Google Play store on Android devices, although wireless carriers get a large chunk of such sales. The direct-to-consumer sales effort means Google will take an undisclosed cut of any sales, which could boost its mobile-related revenue. Google has said it is on pace to generate more than $2.5 billion annually in mobile revenue, or around 5% of total revenue. Over the past year Google has beefed up its phone-based customer support for customers of what is now Google Play, and the same representatives will assist device customers, a company spokeswoman said.

201204,AT&T Hits Dry Patch With Phone Contracts --- Most Customers Signing Two-Year Deals are Tablet Buyers,"AT&T Inc. added virtually none of the most valuable wireless phone customers in the first quarter, as sales of Apple Inc.'s iPhone plunged from the feverish pace seen at the end of last year. While the carrier added 187,000 new two-year contract customers, 180,000 of those involved tablets such as the iPad -- suggesting an anemic 7,000 net phone additions to a contract user base of nearly 70 million. AT&T reported 4.3 million iPhone activations, a 43% drop from the fourth quarter, when the new 4S model helped goose sales. The results were another reminder that the U.S. market for cellphones is nearly saturated, and they rekindled concerns that sales growth even for Apple's popular device will eventually have to slow as the pool of customers without smartphones shrinks. All told, Dallas-based AT&T boosted its customer rolls by 726,000, just below rival Verizon Wireless's 734,000. Verizon Wireless reported 3.2 million iPhone activations in the first quarter, down 24% from last year's final three months. Apple said Tuesday it sold 35.1 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 5% from the previous three months but about double from a year earlier. The iPhone has been AT&T's most-consistent growth driver since it was introduced in 2007, and it has helped the carrier draw millions of customers away from Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp. and T-Mobile USA. But the carrier now must compete with Sprint and even some smaller carriers that are offering the smartphone with unlimited data plans. Further, AT&T is playing catch-up with Verizon Wireless in rolling out the high-speed mobile broadband network known as 4G LTE. Carriers have high hopes the faster networks will attract new customers and help relieve capacity constraints on their existing 3G services as more users download video and photos to their devices. ""We don't see this data growth slowing,"" Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility, said during a conference call with analysts. AT&T's plan to bolster its network by buying T-Mobile was stymied by regulators late last year, leaving the carrier hunting for more capacity to help feed heavy data consumers. The company declined to comment Tuesday on whether it may be interested in spectrum that Verizon Wireless has said it may sell as a condition of purchasing a block of airwaves from a group of cable-television companies. AT&T reported its first-quarter profit jumped 5.2% to $3.6 billion, while revenue rose 1.8% to $31.8 billion. Investors cheered AT&T's ability to lift wireless profit margins, sending shares up 3.6%. The fact AT&T saw fewer customers upgrade to smartphones like the iPhone had a silver lining for the carrier, boosting its profitability by lowering the amount of subsidies it pays to keep smartphone prices down for consumers. In the U.S., carriers pay around $400 to subsidize the cost of each iPhone, analysts estimate. As with other carriers, AT&T is working to squeeze more revenue out of existing customers through new services and fees, such as device-upgrade levies, as U.S. wireless connections now exceed the number of Americans. AT&T's average revenue per contract user, a closely watched metric, edged up to $64.46, from $63.76 at the end of last year. AT&T's wireline business, which includes home and business landline telephones as well as the U-verse television offering, continued to contract as more users switch to wireless service. Wireline operating revenue dropped slightly to $14.9 billion from a year earlier, though AT&T boosted the unit's profits by 2%. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,"Home & Digital -- The Digital Solution: In Race to Beat iPhone, One Android Weighs In","Android phones have an identity problem: Few people know one model from another. There are exceptions to the rule, including Samsung's Galaxy line, which managed to bring a phone of the same name to all four major carriers, and Verizon's Droid, which has been a hit. The rest have been a hodgepodge of model names like Desire, Hero, Tattoo, Thunderbolt, Magic, Inspire and Sensation. Now HTC, the company known for its stylish hardware and Sense user interface, is trying to bring some uniformity to Android phones with its $200 One models. Starting Wednesday, T-Mobile's One S will be available, and AT&T's One X will follow on May 6. On May 7, Sprint will take pre-orders for its EVO 4G LTE, and though it lacks the One name, this is nearly a twin of the One X. Verizon so far isn't joining the party; a spokeswoman would only say the carrier's next phone wouldn't be part of the One series. I've tested T-Mobile's One S for the past week, and it will likely meet the needs of T-Mobile loyalists who long for the iPhone. Its battery life easily got me through each day, and its camera rivals -- and even bests -- certain photos captured on the iPhone 4S. The One S is the thinnest, lightest HTC One in the bunch and it's the thinnest phone HTC has ever made. At 4.2 ounces and 0.30-inch thick, it's even thinner and lighter than the iPhone, which weighs 4.9 ounces and is 0.37-inch thick. The 4.3-inch screen of the HTC One S is large, but manageable, while the AT&T and Sprint models' 4.7-inch screens may scare people away. The big downside to the phone is its network. T-Mobile only offers two flavors of HSPA+, which is far slower than speeds on fast LTE networks like Verizon or AT&T. In downtown Washington, D.C., my average download speed with the T-Mobile One S was just over 3 megabits per second, and upload speeds were about 1 megabit per second. When I tested the phone's speeds on a trip to Boston, the results were even slower. In one of the optimal locations in Washington that T-Mobile suggested I visit for testing, I averaged 6.8 mbps in download speeds and 5.9 mbps in uploads. For comparison, Verizon's 4G LTE gets zippy download speeds of 13 to 14 megabits per second, faster than some home Wi-Fi networks, and its LTE is now available in 230 markets. AT&T's LTE is available in 35 markets. Sprint won't switch its network over to LTE until later this year, so its HTC EVO phone is limited to 3G speeds. T-Mobile has no plans to launch an LTE network this year, and its One S will only operate on the HSPA+ network. The AT&T HTC One X and Sprint HTC EVO look alike and weigh 4.6 ounces and 4.7 ounces, respectively. Sprint's phone has two distinguishing physical features the AT&T model lacks: a kickstand, which cleverly tucks into the back of the phone when not in use, and a dedicated camera button. All HTC One models run the newest version of the Android operating system, called Ice Cream Sandwich. They also have a good quality Beats audio system built in, which works through the phone's speakers or any headphones. HTC's Sense interface adds some polish to Android, and this version of Sense is more toned down to blend with Android compared with past HTC phones. While setting up the T-Mobile One S, I was prompted to create accounts or log into existing accounts for Dropbox, SkyDrive and Evernote, which are all integrated into the phone for seamless sharing. The One's camera is a real draw. Its software is deceptively simple, only displaying the buttons or options that are needed at any given moment. Want to use burst mode to take several photos in a row? Hold down the shutter button and listen as a super fast shutter snaps away. A feature called Best Shot appears after a burst and will automatically select the best photo in a burst group before deleting all of the others. Want to take a still photo while capturing a video? Tap the shutter button, which smartly remains on the screen while video footage is shot. A camera setting can automatically save all images to Dropbox, where One owners get 25 gigabytes of free storage for two years. I took several photos on the T-Mobile One S and then captured the same photo on the iPhone 4S -- the gold standard for smartphone cameras. Though the iPhone did a bit better in a couple of photos, like capturing more detail in the foreground of a sunset, I was drawn to the colors and quality captured on the HTC One. After a week, I found myself reaching for it more than the iPhone. I used the phone for email, texting, social networking and, yes, even phone calls. Its super-thin design took a little getting used to, but I became familiar with it after a few days. T-Mobile's HTC One S is an elegant, fully loaded phone with well-designed features. If you don't mind the network's slower speeds, it's a great find. If you prefer faster speeds, another carrier's One model might be a better fit. --- Email katie.boehret@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,"Apple Rides iPhone Frenzy --- Quarterly Profit Nearly Doubles as Tech Giant Taps China, New Markets","Apple Inc.'s quarterly profit nearly doubled as iPhones and iPads continued to fly off shelves, putting to rest recent worries that the company can't maintain its momentum. Shares gained more than 7%, or $40.55, to $600.83 in after-hours trading Tuesday -- after falling in 10 of the past 11 regular trading sessions amid concerns about a potential iPhone slowdown. Instead, iPhone shipments jumped 88% in the quarter, as Apple continued to penetrate new markets like China. Apple is the most valuable company, but it isn't the best gauge of the health of the global economy. Overall corporate earnings results have been strong but uneven: General Electric Co. said last week that its operating earnings were up; International Business Machines Corp. reported a higher profit, but a drop in sales of computer hardware raised questions about technology spending by businesses and governments. Apple's success comes as it rides the proliferation of smartphones that are reshaping the technology landscape. But unlike some other players, Apple is also driving the changes with products it is able to convince consumers and businesses to buy despite a sluggish economy. In particular, Apple's gains have come at the expense of one-time giants such as Research In Motion Ltd. The quarter's results also suggest that Apple is on its way to doing what the 36-year-old company has yet to do: build a product that has strong and steady demand world-wide. Its Macs and to some degree iPods haven't taken off around the world the way that its iPhone is proving it can. Meanwhile, Chief Executive Tim Cook has taken steps to deal with Apple's growing scale. In March, he said he would put Apple's cash pile, long a subject of consternation among shareholders, to use via a dividend and stock buyback. Still, analysts said Apple's stock could go on a bumpy ride in coming months, particularly as competitors like Nokia Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. rush to market with devices during a window when Apple isn't expected to push a new phone. Analysts predict Apple will launch its next iPhone in the fall, about a year after the 4S model. Expectations for Apple's stock are still lofty, with some analysts having 12-month price targets approaching $1,000 a share. Over the quarter, the nearly five-year-old iPhone remained Apple's key driver. Apple said it sold 35.1 million of the smartphones, up from 18.65 million units a year ago. The device and related products and services formed 57.9% of Apple's sales, up from 52.7% last quarter. The company said its latest iPhone is now available in more than 100 countries and at 230 wireless carriers, up from 90 countries and 186 carriers as of March last year. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said iPhone sales in greater China were five times the level of the year-ago quarter. The results were an encouraging sign of how the hit device would fare outside the U.S., particularly in less affluent countries where smartphone growth is increasingly shifting. ""Smartphone growth domestically is slowing because we have reached a saturation point,"" said Peter Misek, a managing director at Jefferies & Co. He said Apple should be well-positioned in other markets given the strength of luxury brands in countries like China. The Cupertino, Calif., company posted a 94% profit jump to $11.6 billion and a 58.9% revenue increase to $39.2 billion for the first three months of the year from a year earlier. While the numbers showed a slight deceleration from growth rates the quarter before, the results were well above analyst estimates of $9.52 billion in profits on revenue of $36.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales of the iPad over the quarter were lower than some analysts had forecast, but up more than 150% from a year ago to 11.8 million units. Apple introduced a new iPad model during the quarter. During the call, Mr. Cook gave his strongest public hint yet that he'd be willing to settle the sprawling legal battles started by his predecessor Steve Jobs. ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it,"" he said. Apple and Samsung recently agreed to enter settlement talks in a California patent case. Mr. Cook also brushed off some competitors' approaches. When asked about whether Apple's tablets and laptops might converge -- a model Microsoft is pushing with Windows 8 -- he said: ""You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user."" Apple's guidance for the current quarter ending in late June -- revenue of about $34 billion and earnings per share of $8.68 -- was lower than analysts expected, as it usually is. Mr. Oppenheimer said the numbers reflect how the company was able to fulfill demand for the latest devices more quickly, minimizing the spillover of sales into the next quarter.

201204,Doodling for Dollars --- Firms Try to Get Gadget-Obsessed Workers to Look Up -- and Sketch Ideas,"Put down that smartphone; pick up that crayon. Employees at a range of businesses are being encouraged by their companies to doodle their ideas and draw diagrams to explain complicated concepts to colleagues. While whiteboards long have been staples in conference rooms, companies such as Facebook Inc. are now incorporating whiteboards, chalkboards and writable glass on all sorts of surfaces to spark creativity. Firms are also holding training sessions to teach employees the basics of what's known as visual note taking. Others, like vacation-rental company HomeAway Inc. and retailer Zappos, are hiring graphic recorders, consultants who sketch what is discussed at meetings and conferences, cartoon-style, to keep employees engaged. Doodling proponents say it can help generate ideas, fuel collaboration and simplify communication. It can be especially helpful among global colleagues who don't share a common first language. Putting pen to paper also is seen as an antidote to the pervasiveness of digital culture, getting workers to look up from their devices. And studies show it can help workers retain more information. Even with advanced gadgets such as smartphones and tablets, ""the hand is the easiest way to get something down,"" says Everett Katigbak, a communication designer at Facebook. Most of the walls at the company's offices around the country have been coated with dry-erase or chalkboard paint or a treatment for glass to allow employees to sketch ideas whenever they arise. The company's offices are filled with jottings, from mathematical equations to doodles of cats and dollar signs. IdeaPaint Inc., which makes a paint that turns a surface into a whiteboard, says its sales have doubled annually since the product was introduced in 2008. The Ashland, Mass., company says more than half of its business is in the workplace. Taking notes and drawing may help workers stay focused, too. A 2009 study published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology found that doodlers retained more than nondoodlers when remembering information that had been presented in a boring context, such as a meeting or conference call. The logic, according to Jackie Andrade, a psychology professor at the University of Plymouth in England, is that doodling takes up just enough cognitive energy to prevent the mind from daydreaming. Last summer, software maker Citrix Systems Inc. opened a ""design collaboration"" workspace at its Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters. The facility was designed to encourage the company's gadget-obsessed engineers and other employees to let loose and sketch ideas, says Catherine Courage, the company's vice president of product design. Whiteboards cover almost every wall and table. Markers, sticky notes and construction paper are readily available. There are also pipe cleaners and foam balls for 3-D models, and employees make props like hats and glasses to help them act out concepts. To loosen up employees, meetings sometimes begin with participants sketching self-portraits. Although some engineers are skeptical and say they can't draw, ""it gets them in the mood,"" Ms. Courage says. Audra Kalfass, a Citrix software-development engineer, says when she meets with her team and there is a technical issue, ""it's natural to start drawing stuff."" Since nearly every surface in design meeting rooms can be written on -- even the tables are made of whiteboards -- ""you just grab a marker and you start drawing,"" she says. Ms. Kalfass says she is a ""horrible"" artist. Nevertheless, ""it doesn't take much artistic ability to communicate visually. . . It's mostly boxes and lines and stuff like that to get your point across."" At Spectrum Health System, a Grand Rapids, Mich., health-care provider and insurer, technology managers took a workshop with Dan Roam, a San Francisco ""visual problem solving"" consultant, on using images like stick figures and arrows to explain the complexities of the industry to Spectrum employees. After the workshop, Chief Information Officer Patrick O'Hare helped create a presentation featuring cartoonlike sketches for the chief executive. In one, the company's three business branches -- health insurance, hospitals and physician clinics -- were depicted as a body, representing the consumer, divided into three parts. Mr. O'Hare says he isn't a good artist but the workshop taught him it was ""OK to stand up in front of a group and draw stick figures. It doesn't have to be so pristine."" HomeAway, an Austin, Texas, vacation-rental company, hired a graphic facilitator to help train a dozen employeesincluding senior managers and human-resources staffto use visual shorthand and sketching to help guide meetings, says Lori Knowlton, vice president of human resources. The aim was to better ""capture ideas using images,"" she says. Plus, it is more fun than ""being surrounded by spreadsheets and emails."" The company also brought in graphic recorder Sunni Brown to help sketch, in real time, what was discussed at a large company meeting on HomeAway's strategy. The resulting cartoonlike image, which serves as the meeting's minutes, hangs framed at the company's headquarters. At Turner Broadcasting System Inc. in Atlanta, a strategy-development team recently drew tree branches and placed sticky notes on the branches to explore ways to extend the Turner Classic Movies brand. The exercise yielded more than 200 ideas, some of which are in development, says Amy Zehfuss, vice president of network strategy for the Time Warner Inc. unit. ""Seeing all the stickies on the tree is a really powerful visual,"" she says. Even PowerPoint software developers do their share of doodling. Jeffrey Murray, principal test manager for the Microsoft Corp. unit, says his team often starts with whiteboard sketches and cartoonlike storyboards when considering new features. Sketches help ""get everyone on the same page and can convey the emotion and experience of the user,"" he says. Eventually, the images are transferred to PowerPoint decks, he says. Inevitably, developers sketch and scribble over the whiteboard projections. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,AT&T Posts Profit Despite Slow Contract Growth,"AT&T, the nation’s No. 2 cellphone carrier, barely added any new monthly contract customers in the first quarter, but the company still managed to post a profit because it made so much money from the data plans of existing customers. The nation’s biggest carrier, Verizon, had a similar story in its earnings report last week: slower growth in new customers, but nonetheless a profitable quarter. Both carriers are milking profits from the same cash cow, data, which generates regular fees from customers when they browse the Web, watch videos or stream music over carrier networks. “Strong smartphone sales drive data sales, and data drives this business,” Ralph de la Vega, president and chief executive of AT&T Mobility, said during the company’s earnings calls on Tuesday. AT&T said that net income in the first quarter rose to $3.6 billion, or 60 cents a share, from $3.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago, while revenue climbed 1.8 percent to $31.8 billion. Revenue from wireless data jumped 19.9 percent to $6.1 billion from the year-ago quarter, AT&T said. The company said that 60 percent of its data customers were paying for its tiered data plans and of those, 70 percent were opting for the more expensive plans. AT&T’s numbers for new contract customers, on the other hand, were not as pretty. The company reported adding 186,000 contract customers, the majority of whom bought iPads “We continue to capitalize on our terrific momentum in mobile Internet,” said Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T chairman and chief executive, in a statement. “Smartphone and branded computing device sales continue to set a record pace, mobile data revenues were up nearly 20 percent, and we achieved this growth with expanding margins. These results add confidence in our outlook for the year.” AT&T, based in Dallas, said the quarter broke a previous first-quarter record for sales of smartphones, which in turn drove revenue from wireless data. It sold 5.5 million smartphones, up slightly from a year ago, and over the quarter it activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones — 1 million more of the phones than its main rival, Verizon, the largest American wireless carrier, sold during the same period. Craig Moffett, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said carriers typically did not count iPad customers as new contract subscribers, so it was possible that AT&T’s number of new customers actually declined in the quarter. However, he said it was still a strong quarter for AT&T and showed that the company was doing a good job at managing an industrywide transition to slower growth in subscribers, but more growth in data revenue, or “average revenue per user,” or A.R.P.U. “The real question for the carriers is how gracefully can they handle the handoff from a subscriber growth business to an A.R.P.U. business,” Mr. Moffett said. As for AT&T, he said, “There are a whole lot of fireworks here. It’s a pretty good quarter.” Mr. de la Vega of AT&T said during the earnings call that the average revenue per user was about 90 percent higher for smartphones than traditional cellphones. He said that two years ago, customers seemed afraid of smartphones, but now they “feel these devices make their lives easier” and are using smartphones much more than traditional cellphones. “They’re accepting smartphones in numbers that we have never seen before,” he said. AT&T and Verizon are in a race to build faster next-generation networks based on a technology called LTE in an effort to have customers use their data services more. Verizon is in the lead, with LTE deployed in 230 markets, compared with AT&T’s coverage in 35 markets. Faster networks aren’t cheap to build, but they could turn in big numbers for carriers in the long term by encouraging customers to use data-intensive applications, like video, even more. Cisco, the networking company, recently published a study showing that use of mobile data more than doubled in 2011, driven by fourth-generation, or 4G, networks. A smartphone on a 4G network is likely to generate 50 percent more traffic than it would on a slower one, Cisco said.

201204,Google Makes Push Into E-Commerce With New Online Store,"In a move it tried - and abandoned - once before, Google began selling a smartphone directly to consumers through a new online store on Tuesday. Consumers can now buy the Galaxy Nexus smartphone, which is manufactured by Samsung and runs on Google's Android operating system, in the Google Play store, or what it used to call its Android Market. The phone, which costs $399, will ship ""unlocked,"" which means it works with multiple wireless carriers. Google's previous direct-to-consumers push was in January 2010, when it sold its Nexus One smartphone through its online store. It had helped design the phone with HTC, the manufacturer. It abandoned the effort less than six months later because of poor sales. The problem was that T-Mobile was the only carrier that subsidized its $529 price tag, and that carriers refused to sell the phone through their own retail outlets. ""While the global adoption of the Android platform has exceeded our expectations, the web store has not,"" Googlewrote in a blog post in May 2010 ""It's remained a niche channel for early adopters, but it's clear that many customers like a hands-on experience before buying a phone, and they also want a wide range of service plans to chose from."" Google has since worked closely with carriers to make phones with its Android system available in their retail outlets. That has helped make Android the dominant smartphone operating platform with 300 million Android devices activated globally. That, experts say, helped Google lure app developers. Google had 16,000 apps in its Android market when it introduced the Nexus One in January 2010. It now boasts 500,000. ""The Nexus One was a flop, but at least it got a lot of phones into developers' hands,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. Google's new online store could soon feature two new devices: its much-anticipated tablet and a home entertainment device. Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, told an Italian newspaper last December that Google planned to release a tablet by June of this year. The Wall Street Journal, in a subsequent report, said Google would sell the device through its online store. The company is also working on a prototype for a home entertainment device, according to people inside the company who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak. While the initial purpose of the device will be for streaming music, the eventual use could be much wider, these people said. Analysts have largely questioned whether Google's online sales strategy will work. ""It's won't be a game changer,"" said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. To work, Ms. Rotman Epps noted, Google will have to reposition itself from a free search engine into an e-commerce company. Google has always given away its core services for free and generated its revenue from advertising. It will take an undisclosed cut of sales from its online store. ""Google has spent the last decade training consumers to think 'free',"" Ms. Rotman Epps added. ""Now they want to change that relationship and re-brand as a company that sells stuff to consumers. That is a hard thing to do."" * Disruptions: With New Comforts, Growing Complacent * Tomorrow's Privacy Struggles, On Display Today * Daily Report: Considering the Spectrum 'Crisis' * Et Tu, Google?

201204,Corporate News: HTC Says Rebound In U.S. to Be Tough,"TAIPEI -- HTC Corp. forecast a decline in revenue and a narrower profit margin for the second quarter, indicating the tough environment in a smartphone market increasingly dominated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. While Apple and Samsung have been increasing their market share, emerging Chinese competitors such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. have been offering more smartphones with advanced features at low prices. That has put additional pressure on HTC and other rivals that lack the cachet of Apple and Samsung. HTC Chief Executive Peter Chou said strong competition from Apple's iPhone 4S in the U.S. has hurt HTC's earnings in the past two quarters. ""It's difficult to recover our market share in the U.S.,"" Mr. Chou said during an online forum Tuesday. ""We will have more balanced growth in different markets this year."" The company forecast second-quarter revenue of around 105 billion New Taiwan dollars, or US$3.56 billion, down from NT$124.4 billion a year earlier, but recovering from NT$67.79 billion in the first quarter. The Taiwan company projected second-quarter gross-profit margin of 27%, compared with 28.8% a year earlier. HTC's first-quarter margin was 25%. HTC, which was among the earliest handset makers to introduce smartphones that use Google Inc.'s Android operating system, started losing ground in the second half of last year as sales of Apple's latest iPhone and Samsung's Android-based Galaxy smartphone rose. The Taiwan company, which started out as a contract manufacturer, began to make phones under its own brand in 2006. In 2010, HTC became the top seller of Android-based smartphones in the U.S., with a market share of 11.8%. HTC lost its top spot in the U.S. to South Korea's Samsung this year. Apple and Samsung together held nearly half of the world's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Gartner, with Apple at 23.8% and Samsung at 22.6%. HTC's share stood at 7.2%. HTC reported this month that its first-quarter earnings slumped 70% from a year earlier to the company's lowest quarterly profit since 2006. ""We are confident in the company's future. We have seen encouraging growth momentum in the second quarter,"" Mr. Chou said Tuesday. The U.S. won't be HTC's largest market this year as the company aims to increase its presence in Asia and Europe, he said. HTC didn't disclose its revenue breakdown by region, but analysts said the U.S. accounted for about half of the company's revenue last year and about 40% of HTC's smartphone shipments. Mr. Chou said the company plans ""substantial"" marketing expenses in the second quarter to strengthen its brand image. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Analysis: Summary of recent California newspaper editorials,"April 20 The Press Democrat: ""A vote for safe, modern schools"" By practically any measure, California shortchanges its schools. Classes are too large, the school year is too short and demoralizing cutbacks are an annual exercise. One exception is facilities, a spending category controlled by voters rather than state legislators. In Sonoma County and around the state, voters routinely authorize bonds to build new schools and maintain existing facilities. In 2010, despite a recession, 58 of 77 school bond measures passed. On June 5, bond acts will be on the ballot in five local school districts: --Measure E: $35 million for secondary schools in Healdsburg. -- Measure F: $6 million for the Guerneville School District. -- Measure G: $26 million for Petaluma's Old Adobe Union School District. -- Measure H: $9 million for the Sebastopol Union School District. --Measure I: $14 million for the Wright School District in Santa Rosa. Each of the measures authorizes an almost identical list of projects: solar panels and energy-efficient windows, classroom technology, roof repairs, upgrading libraries, labs, playgrounds and multipurpose rooms. Each district will pick specific projects after the election. Critics say the schools should have been setting aside money for roof repairs and other maintenance. But for districts struggling with day-to-day costs amid continuing state cutbacks, finding that money in the budget is virtually impossible. And allowing schools to deteriorate undercuts our next generation of leaders. We recommend approval of all five bond measures. However, we have one concern to share. In Healdsburg and Sebastopol, which have outstanding bond debt, the new bonds would be structured to backload payments. That will keep property tax rates at their present levels, but it's almost certain to increase total interest costs for the new bond issues. (In the other districts, debt payments will add an estimated $30 to property tax bills for every $100,000 in assessed value.) Ordinarily, we'd prefer to see school districts retire one bond issue before starting another instead of paying more interest to avoid asking voters to increase property tax assessments. However, with interest rates and construction bids at historic lows, school districts that act now can stretch their dollars. There's a sixth school finance measure on the June 5 ballot, Measure D, an $89 parcel tax in the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District. Unlike a bond, a parcel tax can pay for operating costs, including salaries for teachers and librarians. A parcel tax also requires a two-thirds majority, as opposed to 55 percent for school bonds. Funding for Cotati-Rohnert Park schools has tumbled 27 percent over the past four years, and without more revenue or even deeper cuts, the district may not meet state solvency standards. In a bid to attract some of the 700 local students who go to school in other districts, Cotati-Rohnert Park officials plan to reopen one of three schools closed in recent years, reconfigure other campuses and introduce some year-round programs. It's an ambitious approach, and it deserves a chance to succeed. We recommend approval of Measure D as well as Measures E, F, G, H and I. They're investments in our future. -------- April 22 The Sacramento Bee: ""Will energy pact stifle competition?"" A California Public Utilities Commission settlement with one of several energy companies that overcharged Californians during the energy crisis a decade ago holds out some promise for the state in years to come. By terms of the settlement struck last month, the energy company NRG of New Jersey would pay $20 million to the state, and spend another $100 million to build 200 charging stations for electric vehicles in California. Gov. Jerry Brown, who has signed an executive order calling for 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025, hailed the settlement, saying it would jump-start the electric vehicle industry in California. That said, there is no cause for elation. The commission and the company have not released the tentative settlement, and probably won't until the deal is final, sometime later this month. Assemblyman Paul Fong, a Silicon Valley Democrat, and Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan, D-Alamo, are raising concerns, urging that the commission release the full agreement and hold a public hearing. ""We need to find out the facts. Why are they getting this benefit?"" Fong asked in an interview. Fong said the $120 million payment is a fraction of the sum that Californians paid in artificially inflated electricity costs during the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001. Fong cited a petition to the Public Utilities Commission in which one of NRG's competitors said the value of the state claim against NRG could have been $940 million, and suggested that the $120 million settlement was a bargain. The assemblyman also noted that NRG already is seeking to expand its business into profit-making charging stations, and said the settlement would merely require the company spend its money as it otherwise would do anyway. Most significantly, there is a concern that the settlement would give an edge to NRG over Bay Area companies trying to break into the charging station business. The last thing the state should seek is to limit competition in an emerging field. The commission believes the introduction of NRG would in fact add to the competition in the California market. If Brown's goal of 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles is realized, California will need far more than 200 charging stations. NRG intends to build the stations in the Bay Area, the Los Angeles basin, San Diego County and the San Joaquin Valley. The final agreement must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. California political leaders, NRG's competitors and the public have every right to question the California Public Utilities Commission and the energy companies that ravaged the ratepayers a little more than a decade ago. The commission should open its process, hold a public hearing and air the issues. -------- April 24 San Jose Mercury News: ""House should kill cybersecurity bill"" When political polar opposites like San Jose Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul are both arguing against a piece of legislation, you know it must have serious problems. The bill before the House is the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, known as CISPA. It has the best of intentions, to bolster the nation's defense against the very real threat of cyber attacks. But Democrat Lofgren is right when she argues it gives the government far too much access to the online data of every American Internet user. Paul's criticism goes even further, saying it makes ""government spies"" of companies such as Google and Facebook. He says it would allow them to share all kinds of information with the government, including members' emails, the websites they visit and the medical, educational and financial records they may have online. A House vote is scheduled Friday. Congress needs to kill this bill and start over. When it does, it should include Lofgren or someone like her to help write it with the privacy interests of America's Internet users in mind. Tablets, smartphones and laptops have become so commonplace that everyone seems to think they're an expert, including members of Congress. House members try to demonstrate their techno cred by signing onto the latest cybersecurity bill -- but as the recent fight over the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) proved, cybersecurity issues are extraordinarily complex. Protecting the government's interests can conflict sharply with the interests of individual citizens and even the companies producing the latest wizardry. Valley companies such as Facebook, Intel and Oracle are all reportedly signed up in support of CISPA, which is understandable. They are the ones with the most to lose in a cyber attack. But Internet users deserve to have their privacy protected, too. And as the bill now stands, personal privacy protection is all but nonexistent. CISPA's sponsors, Reps. C.A. Ruppersberger, D-Md., and Mike Rogers, R-Mich., argue that their legislation can't force Internet companies such as Facebook to turn over information to the government. But the legislation lacks sufficient restrictions on what companies can hand over. Facebook recently released a statement saying it has no intention of giving the government sensitive information, but users shouldn't have to rely on the judgment of companies to decide what should or shouldn't be revealed. And in its current version, CISPA wouldn't require companies to tell users what they're disclosing, or when. Lofgren and Paul aren't the only significant opponents of the legislation. The White House recently expressed concerns about the bill. Unfortunately, since so many high-tech companies are on board with it, the kind of public outcry necessary to defeat the legislation is lacking. Lofgren fears it will quietly pass into law. Internet users should not rely on the possibility of a presidential veto to protect their interests. They need to let Congress know now that securing the safety of the Internet cannot come at the cost of the people's Fourth Amendment rights. -------- April 20 The Bakersfield Californian: ""Regulate medical cannabis at state level"" A bill that would create a state authority for regulation of marijuana dispensaries makes sense. It would bring order to an industry that currently lacks it and legitimacy to the idea of marijuana having medicinal benefits by establishing clear rules for its sale, production and use. The legislation would do this by creating a nine-member medical marijuana board within the state's Department of Consumer Affairs -- the same department that houses the state's medical, registered nursing and pharmacy boards. The board would be in charge of permitting and establishing rules for businesses that sell, grow and transport medical marijuana and levying fines and penalties against violators. The legislation would allow one dispensary per 50,000 residents in a city or county area and, most importantly, would allow local voters to ban them outright or impose tighter restrictions. The law will require careful crafting but if done correctly will accomplish what many individual counties have not been able to do: create a credible, sensible means to get medical treatment to those who legitimately need it -- an objective that was the intent of California voters who passed the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. It would also bring California in line with most other compassionate-use states which have established a centralized authority for the drug's regulation. Furthermore, it would present a more united front to the federal government, which at times has warmed to the idea of allowing states to permit the medical use of marijuana -- even as it has pursued prosecutions in California. However, the bill should be amended to include some of the safeguards requested by law enforcement groups. They have advocated for provisions such as requiring marijuana workers to be licensed, mandating surveillance of marijuana shops and requiring preapproval for transportation of medical cannabis. These requests deserve consideration by the bill's author, Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco. Consensus is building in the medical community that marijuana has a role in patient therapy. Eighteen states have legalized this use. The federal government must do the same at some point. Still, regulation will be key to controlling the conditions for which one can be prescribed marijuana and how it's packaged and distributed to those patients. This bill consolidates those rules under a single authority while retaining the right of voters in a municipality to impose further limitation or bans on medicinal marijuana. This is a far better approach than leaving regulation subject to local law enforcement and a handful of local politicians. -------- April 25 Los Angeles Times: ""California's justice revolution"" California is on the verge of a justice revolution. Realignment, as it is known, is a set of changes thrust upon the state by our collective inertia: Prisons had become so overcrowded as to violate the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and Californians demonstrated no will to pay more money for more prisons. As a result, the courts ordered the prisons to reduce their inmate population by 30,000 over the next two years. So Gov. Jerry Brown and the Democratic-controlled Legislature quickly and somewhat carelessly adopted realignment, which transfers responsibility for many felons who have completed their prison time, and many newly convicted felons, from the state to the counties. In the process, the shift clears a festering multimillion-dollar problem from the state's books. But the philosophy behind realignment is based on more than a decade of thinking, studying, evidence-gathering and soul-searching over the costly cycle of crime, incarceration, failure and return to prison. Felons who are yet salvageable -- whose crimes are neither serious nor sexual nor violent -- can be supervised, treated and monitored at the local level instead of being housed with hardened convicts in distant and costly state facilities. Agencies can assess defendants and separate those who need treatment from those who need to be under lock and key. The public can be safer, the cycle can be broken, and tax money can be spent more constructively -- and more frugally. This revolution will be won, with crime rates continuing to fall and with a corrections and rehabilitation complex finally worthy of the names, or it will be lost, with treatment money spent instead on more lockups and with bureaucratic slip-ups leading to the wrong people going free, based on the decisions of just a few key Californians over the coming several years. One of them will be the next district attorney of Los Angeles County. Nearly half the state's population of addicts, mentally ill and petty offenders -- foolishly incarcerated in costly and overcrowded institutions -- comes from this county, as does nearly half the population of California's most dangerous and violent criminals. The Los Angeles County district attorney will set the course. Realignment will be the office's centerpiece. Voters who are sifting through the candidates for district attorney should know some basics about realignment. The program comes in four parts, all of which focus on gradually transferring some responsibilities from the state to the counties: State inmates who were incarcerated for nonviolent, non-serious and non-sexual crimes leave prison on the same schedule and return to the same home communities as before, but they now report to county probation officers instead of state parole agents. Former inmates under supervision who are accused of violating the terms of their release and who would previously have gone to a parole board for a decision on revocation now go to court. Former inmates whose parole is revoked will go to county jail instead of state prison. And new convicts who formerly would go to state prison to serve their sentences for most nonviolent, non-serious and non-sexual offenses will now go to county jail, or to alternative punishment or supervision (some 60 offenses that fall within the so-called non-non-non group still will result in state prison time). Voters should expect the six candidates for district attorney to have mastered the facts of realignment and to be able to present well-thought-out policies for re-creating the justice system in Los Angeles County and making the reforms stick. But today, none of the candidates seems completely prepared to grapple with what to do next. Some repeat falsehoods as if they were gospel: Los Angeles County's jails are overcrowded (false; they are at about half capacity). California's recidivism rate is 70% (meaningless, without distinguishing between a new criminal offense that should land an offender back behind bars and a technical parole violation, such as failing to report to an agent in time). Realignment puts parolees on our streets unsupervised (a blatant falsehood). State prisoners are being released early under realignment (false). But it's true that if prosecutors, the courts and the sheriff are not careful, they will release people whom they should keep. And it's true that under realignment, more jail inmates (as opposed to prison inmates) may be unsupervised upon release. Alan Jackson has two answers to realignment: repeal it (which is not going to happen, and Jackson knows it) and allow counties to send prisoners out of state instead of seeking alternative treatment and supervision for those who can respond to it. Carmen Trutanich repeats the old saw that ""we cannot start crying, `The sky is falling.'"" We know that, but what would he do as D.A. to make realignment work? ""This is a terrible mistake,"" Jackie Lacey offers somewhat wearily. ""But it's also an opportunity."" Very well, but how will she respond to that opportunity? Danette Meyers sees part of the solution in training prosecutors, and her approach has some promise: seek probation, so that defendants may remain on the hook until they have completed restitution to their victims. And Bobby Grace says the district attorney must take a stronger role in seeking funding for re-entry programs that keep the public safe and direct the offender toward a clean life. But we need more from the district attorney candidates. More details, more facts, more information about the level of their commitment to remaking the justice system in a way that works. Realignment should be a key issue in this campaign, along with the others outlined in The Times' ""The Next D.A."" series: juvenile justice, three strikes, the death penalty, and public integrity. They still have a few weeks to make their case. -------- April 24 Merced Sun-Star: ""Paddleboard rule doesn't float"" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Costa Mesa) sent a letter to the U.S. Coast Guard, March 23, calling federal enforcement of rules pertaining to stand-up paddleboarding ""nonsense."" We agree. Over-regulating a recreational activity like stand-up paddleboarding is silly enough, but diverting agency resources meant to protect our nation's coasts for such a purpose is even more disconcerting. What spurred the congressman's letter - and some controversy among boarders - is that under Coast Guard determinations, paddleboards are classified as ""vessels""; thus, their riders are subject to rules such as being forced to wear personal flotation devices. That rule doesn't apply to similar sports like sailboarding and windsurfing, which are exempt from the flotation device requirement. Steven Allan Fry, a director of the Human Powered Watercraft Association says such rules jeopardize ""the enjoyment and comfort of this wonderful water sport."" He argues a ""simple leash"" like those worn by surfers is more reasonable and even safer for stand-up paddleboarders. Surfers are not legally bound to wear lifejackets; stand-up paddleboarders ought to be afforded the same option. Stand-up paddleboarding is a rapidly growing, surface-water sport where participants stand on a device similar to a surfboard and use paddles to row through bodies of water. Now that the sport is becoming more popular, some worry that regulators are getting antsy. It brings to mind the words of President Ronald Reagan when he famously described government philosophy: ""If it moves, regulate it."" In this case, if it floats, regulate it. ""I request that you take appropriate action to ensure federal regulation of stand-up paddleboards in navigable waters reflects common sense and serves the best interests of the United States Coast Guard as well as the public using our waterways,"" Rep. Rohrabacher wrote to Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Robert J. Papp. ""We do not want the brave men and women who protect and serve along our coastline distracted by non-essential boating safety duties. Enforcing life-preserver rules for people on stand-up paddleboards is not only non-essential, it is nonsense."" Mr. Rohrabacher argues that if regulation is necessary it should come locally, not from national edicts. ""In the surf break, wave-riding devices are subject to local rules made by local officials accountable to the local community. The customs and protocols established by the waver rider community should also play a role,"" he wrote. ""Promoting uniform enforcement of federal and local boating and water safety rules benefit all who depend on the waters for their livelihood and recreation."" The congressman wrote, ""Restraint of federal power, in favor of local rules, brings about the best result. Let's not let an overzealous federal regulatory impulse create disarray in uniform water safety enforcement policy that has worked well for over 30 years."" He is right. Mr. Fry sent an email to the Coast Guard to confirm receipt of Mr. Rohrabacher's letter. Capt. Paul Thomas responded in an April 12 email: ""I did receive the letter. Our response is being drafted."" He also noted that an ""exemption"" for stand-up paddleboarding ""is not an option"" due to Coast Guard policy and legal precedent. It looks as though the sport's enthusiasts may have a mounting battle on their hands. The Coast Guard would be misguided not to exempt paddleboarding from the flotation rule. These lightweight, small boards are flotation devices. Let common sense win out. Allow boarders to enjoy the water freely. 7 Press Association, Inc.

Nokia Corp. says sales of smartphones dropped to 12 million in the first quarter, from 24 million a year earlier, while volume sales of cellphones fell to 83 million from 108 million a year earlier. Tuesday: Apple Inc. says it sold 35 million iPhones in the quarter, almost twice as many as it sold a year ago and above analyst expectations. IPad sales came in below analyst expectations, at 11.8 million units. But that was still two and a half times as many as it sold in the same quarter a year ago. Mac sales were also slightly below expectations, at 4 million. That was 7 percent more than a year ago. Apple sold 7.7 million iPods, down 15 percent from a year earlier. AT&T Inc. says it activated 4.3 million iPhones in the first quarter. That was down from 7.6 million in the fourth quarter, when AT&T began selling the iPhone 4S. However, the number was still up from the 3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold in the same quarter a year ago. HTC Corp. reports a drop in first-quarter earnings and revenue as it faces competition from Apple and Samsung, but it expects revenue to rise in the current quarter with its ""HTC One"" series phone that offers users a better camera and music experience in addition to a sleek design.

201204,"South Korea's LG Electronics returns to profit on mobile revival, TV demand","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - LG Electronics Inc. posted its first profit in three quarters, beating expectations thanks to a revival in its mobile business and demand for high-end TVs. The South Korean company Wednesday reported net profit of 243 billion won ($215 million) for the January-March period. It had a loss of 15.8 billion won a year earlier. Overall sales fell 7 percent from a year earlier to 12.2 trillion won but increased smartphone sales and strong demand for premium TVs in its home market shored up LG's earnings. The company's quarterly operating profit more than tripled from a year earlier to 448 billion won, beating a market consensus of 395 billion won. LG Electronics, whose handset business lost 286 billion won in 2011, is slowly regaining competitiveness with the introduction of its Optimus series of smartphones and by allocating more resources to lucrative high-end phones. Its mobile communication business, which includes handsets, lost money for six straight quarters between April 2010 and September 2011, while its hometown rival Samsung Electronics Co. quickly played catch up with Apple Inc. In the first three months of this year, LG's handset business posted a 35.2 billion won operating profit, a big improvement from a loss of 101 billion won a year earlier. Despite tepid TV demand in Europe and other developed countries, LG's TV-making unit posted an operating profit that nearly doubled from a year earlier. The improvement was largely driven by strong sales of its premium 3-D TVs in South Korea, the company said. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,"Monthly smartphone bills down at AT&T, challenging picture of growth","NEW YORK (AP) - Hidden in AT&T Inc.'s financial statements is a story that runs counter to its optimistic profit projections: The company is generating less revenue from each new smartphone subscriber. Calculations by The Associated Press, based on AT&T's public statements, indicate that the average monthly bill for its smartphone subscribers has fallen from $88 to $80 in the space of a year. That number should be of great concern to Dallas-based AT&T, because like most big phone companies, it is struggling with a slowdown in new subscribers. Nearly all adults -- and many kids -- in the U.S. already have cellphones. AT&T's executives have been touting smartphones as the solution, since the devices require consumers to pay for data use in addition to voice calls. Smartphone subscribers, therefore, pay more. So moving customers from regular phones to smartphones will keep boosting revenue, AT&T has said. But an analysis of AT&T's own figures indicates that smartphone bills have shrunk by 9 percent over a year, challenging the company's picture of long-term revenue growth. The AP's calculations are based on various figures AT&T makes public -- and a bit of basic algebra. The company doesn't disclose the average smartphone bill, but says it's 90 percent higher than the average non-smartphone bill. AT&T reveals the number of smartphone and non-smartphone subscribers, and the average monthly bill for a contract-based plan, which is $64.46. Together, these numbers allow for an approximate calculation of the average smartphone bill. AT&T did not explicitly confirm the calculations, but its chief financial officer, John Stephens, said that the composition of new smartphone customers is changing. The early smartphone adopters were business people and others willing and able to pay high monthly fees. Now, AT&T and other phone companies are going after people who can't pay as much. ""We go after the biggest spenders at the start, that's natural economics,"" he said. But even these lower-paying customers are profitable, he said, because they use the network less. In a more typical projection, Ralph de la Vega, the head of AT&T's wireless division, told analysts Tuesday that demand for wireless data is going to continue to drive an increase in monthly bills. ""Quite frankly, it's hard for us to see a cap on that,"" de la Vega said. Bills for non-smartphone subscribers on contract-based plans are shrinking at about the same rate. Only by shifting these subscribers to smartphone contracts has AT&T been able to keep its average monthly bill for all contract-based plans rising, by 1.7 percent from a year ago. AT&T, the country's largest telecommunications company, reported first-quarter results Tuesday morning, showing that it essentially gained no phone subscribers on contract-based plans in the first quarter. That's only happened once before: a year ago, when Verizon launched its version of the iPhone. Contract-based plans are by far the most lucrative for a phone company, and the number of new customers is an important measure of growth. AT&T gained a net 187,000 customers on contract-based plans in the January to March period, but these were almost all tablet computer users, brought in by the launch of the new iPad in March. In contrast, Verizon last week reported adding 501,000 subscribers on contract-based plans, of which about half were tablet users. Over the last five quarters, Verizon has added nearly three times as many contract subscribers as AT&T. Over the previous two years, the rivals split new subscribers nearly evenly. AT&T gained a net 726,000 subscribers of all kinds in the first quarter, counting ones on no-contract plans and ones on non-phone devices like e-readers and tablet computers. That was the lowest figure in eight years, and less than a third of the number of subscribers added in the same period last year. De la Vega said a drop in sales of e-readers that connect to AT&T's network was behind much of the smaller increase in overall subscribers. Amazon.com Inc. has been selling Kindle e-readers that use AT&T's network, but its new flagship device, the Kindle Fire, only uses Wi-Fi. Weak subscriber figures are usually good for a phone company's earnings in the short term because it doesn't have to subsidize new devices. The company's net income for the January-March period was $3.6 billion, or 60 cents per share, up 5 percent from $3.4 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet were on average expecting earnings of 57 cents per share for the latest quarter. In particular, AT&T saved money by selling fewer iPhones than analysts expected. AT&T subsidizes each new iPhone by hundreds of dollars, hoping to make the money back over time in the form of service fees. AT&T said it activated 4.3 million iPhones in the first quarter. That was down from 7.6 million in the fourth quarter, when AT&T began selling the iPhone 4S. However, the number was still up from the 3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue was $31.8 billion, up 2 percent from a year earlier. It matched analyst expectations. AT&T shares rose $1.11, or 3.6 percent, to close at $31.72. The shares are close to the four-year high of $31.97 hit a month ago. Macquarie Securities analyst Kevin Smithen said the strong first-quarter earnings could mislead investors. He said he believes AT&T's profits will shrink this year as it upgrades more handsets, even as it continues to lose market share to Verizon. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, was more optimistic, saying the first-quarter results demonstrated ""the successful handoff from growth to profitability."" It's possible, he said, that AT&T will be able to wring more money out of each wireless subscriber through data usage fees. It also looks like the company is getting better at reining in smartphone subsidies, he said. ------ Peter Svensson can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/petersvensson 7 Press Association, Inc.

201204,Corning Sees LCD Price Pressure Easing,"NEW YORK—Corning Inc. Wednesday signaled that it is moving past the bottom of the market for liquid-crystal display glass sales, where recent price cuts helped send quarterly earnings 38% lower compared with last year. Corning, the world's largest maker of LCD glass for televisions, said it was trimming price declines from the last two quarters. Dim demand for television sets has spurred flat-panel makers with excess supply to negotiate steep price declines in recent quarters. But Wednesday, Corning signaled that it expects sales volumes to rise later this year, an outlook that helped nudge shares 6.1% higher. The magnitude of the price declines is ""significantly down"" from the two most recent quarters, Chief Financial Officer James B. Flaws said during a conference call. Mr. Flaws characterized retail demand as ""okay."" Corning posted a first-quarter profit of $462 million, or 30 cents a share, down from $748 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 0.2% to $1.92 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue of $1.87 billion. LCD-glass volumes performed better than the company expected. The display-technologies segment that houses the LCD operation represented about one-third of total sales, but the vast majority of net income. Volume at its wholly owned business was up by a mid-single-digit percentage sequentially versus guidance for flat volume. At its joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co., volume was down less than 10% sequentially, better than guidance for a low double-digit percentage decline. Better pricing, combined with stronger LCD glass-volume growth later in the year because of normal retail seasonality, would bring LCD-glass revenue back to growth later this year, Mr. Flaws said. However, Corning won't be bringing capacity back up significantly. ""It's our feeling the glass industry overall is doing exactly the same, and we see no wholesale change to light up a ton of capacity,"" Mr. Flaws said. The company also predicted continued strong sales growth in its smaller telecommunications and specialty-materials segments, which make optical fiber and glass for handheld devices, respectively. Telecom sales are expected to be up in a low to mid-teen percentage sequentially, and specialty sales are expected to rise 10% to 15% sequentially, driven by its Gorilla Glass product for smartphones and tablet computers. In a note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue said Apple Inc.'s upcoming version of a television may help drive Gorilla Glass sales further. The computer maker, which is frequently tight-lipped about new product introductions, has yet to officially acknowledge a TV product, but it is widely reported to be working on a television that relies on wireless streaming technology to access shows, movies and other content. Corning already makes the majority of the glass for the iPhone, Apple recently said. In the latest period, sales in the telecommunications segment were up about 7.2%. In specialty materials, revenue rose 13%. Mr. Flaws said during the call that Gorilla Glass saw a surge in demand in March, which Corning believes was due to companies preparing for the launch of new product models. The company said it continued to buy back its shares in the latest period but at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter. However, Mr. Flaws said investors shouldn't view that as a sign that Corning's repurchasing pattern is any less bullish. Equity earnings were down sequentially, as expected, to $35 million in the latest period but are forecast to rise slightly in the current period, excluding special items, also on a sequential basis. The figure included profits from the company's ventures with Samsung and Dow Chemical Co. Write to Joan E. Solsman at joan.solsman@dowjones.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,"In Race to Beat iPhone, One Android Weighs In","Android phones have an identity problem: Few people know one model from another. There are exceptions to the rule, including Samsung's Galaxy line, which managed to bring a phone of the same name to all four major carriers, and Verizon's Droid, which has been a hit. The rest have been a hodgepodge of model names like Desire, Hero, Tattoo, Thunderbolt, Magic, Inspire and Sensation. Now HTC, the company known for its stylish hardware and Sense user interface, is trying to bring some uniformity to Android phones with its $200 One models. Starting Wednesday, T-Mobile's One S will be available, and AT&T's One X will follow on May 6. On May 7, Sprint will take pre-orders for its EVO 4G LTE, and though it lacks the One name, this is nearly a twin of the One X. Verizon so far isn't joining the party; a spokeswoman would only say the carrier's next phone wouldn't be part of the One series. I've tested T-Mobile's One S for the past week, and it will likely meet the needs of T-Mobile loyalists who long for the iPhone. Its battery life easily got me through each day, and its camera rivals—and even bests—certain photos captured on the iPhone 4S. The One S is the thinnest, lightest HTC One in the bunch and it's the thinnest phone HTC has ever made. At 4.2 ounces and 0.30-inch thick, it's even thinner and lighter than the iPhone, which weighs 4.9 ounces and is 0.37-inch thick. The 4.3-inch screen of the HTC One S is large, but manageable, while the AT&T and Sprint models' 4.7-inch screens may scare people away. The big downside to the phone is its network. T-Mobile only offers two flavors of HSPA+, which is far slower than speeds on fast LTE networks like Verizon or AT&T. In downtown Washington, D.C., my average download speed with the T-Mobile One S was just over 3 megabits per second, and upload speeds were about 1 megabit per second. When I tested the phone's speeds on a trip to Boston, the results were even slower. In one of the optimal locations in Washington that T-Mobile suggested I visit for testing, I averaged 6.8 mbps in download speeds and 5.9 mbps in uploads. For comparison, Verizon's 4G LTE gets zippy download speeds of 13 to 14 megabits per second, faster than some home Wi-Fi networks, and its LTE is now available in 230 markets. AT&T's LTE is available in 35 markets. Sprint won't switch its network over to LTE until later this year, so its HTC EVO phone is limited to 3G speeds. T-Mobile has no plans to launch an LTE network this year, and its One S will only operate on the HSPA+ network. The AT&T HTC One X and Sprint HTC EVO look alike and weigh 4.6 ounces and 4.7 ounces, respectively. Sprint's phone has two distinguishing physical features the AT&T model lacks: a kickstand, which cleverly tucks into the back of the phone when not in use, and a dedicated camera button. All HTC One models run the newest version of the Android operating system, called Ice Cream Sandwich. They also have a good quality Beats audio system built in, which works through the phone's speakers or any headphones. HTC's Sense interface adds some polish to Android, and this version of Sense is more toned down to blend with Android compared with past HTC phones. While setting up the T-Mobile One S, I was prompted to create accounts or log into existing accounts for Dropbox, SkyDrive and Evernote, which are all integrated into the phone for seamless sharing. The One's camera is a real draw. Its software is deceptively simple, only displaying the buttons or options that are needed at any given moment. Want to use burst mode to take several photos in a row? Hold down the shutter button and listen as a super fast shutter snaps away. A feature called Best Shot appears after a burst and will automatically select the best photo in a burst group before deleting all of the others. Want to take a still photo while capturing a video? Tap the shutter button, which smartly remains on the screen while video footage is shot. A camera setting can automatically save all images to Dropbox, where One owners get 25 gigabytes of free storage for two years. I took several photos on the T-Mobile One S and then captured the same photo on the iPhone 4S—the gold standard for smartphone cameras. Though the iPhone did a bit better in a couple of photos, like capturing more detail in the foreground of a sunset, I was drawn to the colors and quality captured on the HTC One. After a week, I found myself reaching for it more than the iPhone. I used the phone for email, texting, social networking and, yes, even phone calls. Its super-thin design took a little getting used to, but I became familiar with it after a few days. T-Mobile's HTC One S is an elegant, fully loaded phone with well-designed features. If you don't mind the network's slower speeds, it's a great find. If you prefer faster speeds, another carrier's One model might be a better fit.

201204,Google Tests Direct Sales With Smartphone,"Google Inc. Tuesday began selling a smartphone directly to consumers through its online store, a revival of a strategy that could be a prelude to direct sales of other devices such as tablets. The Internet company began selling the Galaxy Nexus, made by Samsung Electronics Co., for $399 through its Google Play store. The handset, one of many rivals to Apple Inc.'s hit iPhone, is unlocked—meaning it doesn't come with a wireless contract and can work on multiple carrier networks. People can insert a working AT&T Inc. or T-Mobile SIM card to obtain wireless service for the device, which runs the latest version of Google's Android operating system and includes its Chrome mobile-Web browser. The same phone is available for around $200 for anyone signing a two-year contract with Verizon Wireless or SprintNextel Corp. Google said it was opening a new ""devices"" section of the Google Play store, which was formerly called Android market and sells apps and digital media—just like Apple's iTunes store. The move comes two years after Google abandoned efforts to sell an earlier smartphone directly to consumers online. That device, called the Nexus One, was made by HTC Corp. Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google was preparing to sell tablet computers directly to consumers through an online store, as the company has been frustrated with sales of such devices by wireless carriers and other stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Android is the No. 1 smartphone operating system but lags far behind the iPad in the tablet market. More than 300 million Android devices have been activated, the company said Tuesday. Google licenses Android software for free to hardware makers like Samsung, HTC and Sony Mobile, letting them build hardware around it. Google generates revenue through the sale of ad space on mobile websites, including its search engine, and mobile apps. It also generates some revenue through sales of some mobile apps and digital media such as books, music and movies through its Google Play store on Android devices, although wireless carriers get a large chunk of such sales. The direct-to-consumer sales effort means Google will take an undisclosed cut of any sales, which could boost its mobile-related revenue. Google has said it is on pace to generate more than $2.5 billion annually in mobile revenue, or around 5% of total revenue. In the two years since Google tried selling the Nexus One, it has added new skills that could serve it well this time around. Over the past year Google has beefed up its phone-based customer support for customers of what is now Google Play, and the same representatives will assist device customers, a company spokeswoman said. Google also is more experienced at mass-media marketing of its Web services, including producing ads for TV—a skill it is expected to use to promote devices such as tablets later this year, people familiar with the matter have said.

201204,Huawei Plans 20% Rise in R&D Spending,"SHENZHEN, China—Huawei Technologies Co. will increase its research-and-development spending nearly 20% this year to $4.5 billion, as the company moves aggressively to expand beyond its core telecommunications business. The Chinese company said at an analyst meeting on Wednesday that it will look to increase its business in the faster-growing mobile-device and enterprise-network markets to meet a target of 15% to 20% revenue growth for this year. Huawei's revenue rose nearly 12% to 203.9 billion yuan ($32.3 billion) last year. The R&D goal marks a slowdown from 34% growth in 2011, but Huawei acting Chief Executive Eric Xu said the target is aggressive for a company that believes it has caught up with rivals technologically. ""Our research and development isn't conservative, but on the contrary aggressive,"" Mr. Xu said. ""If you look at our history in the past 20 years, we have been following the industry for our products. However, when it comes to today, in a lot of areas we don't have a benchmark or leader to follow."" Huawei is moving into businesses such as cellphones and computer-network gear. Mr. Xu said growth at the company's core business—providing infrastructure equipment to telecommunications providers—has slowed as providers have squeezed equipment companies on prices. He added that he expects the trend to continue. At the same time, Huawei's other industries face their own competitive pressures. The company's growing number of higher-end smartphones increasingly compete with the likes of Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp., while its enterprise-network business competes with companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. In early April, Cisco CEO John Chambers identified Huawei as Cisco's toughest rival and added that the Chinese company doesn't always ""play by the rules"" in areas such as intellectual-property protection and computer security. At the analyst conference, Mr. Xu said ""from our point of view we don't look at Cisco as our competitor, because the businesses that compete with Cisco head-on account for a small amount of our business revenue."" Analysts say the two companies are likely to compete more often over sales of networking equipment and services and add that it could be difficult for Huawei to challenge Cisco's dominance in the segment. Though Mr. Xu didn't indicate any concrete targets for the growth of the enterprise business, David He, president of marketing at Huawei's enterprise business, said the company is hoping to beat the roughly 57% revenue increase that it posted in the segment last year. John Roese, a senior vice president at Huawei, said hiring for its enterprise laboratories in the U.S. would slow, but mostly because the company added so many engineers in 2011. He said the company has recruited employees away from competitors such as Cisco and Hewlett-Packard Co. by enticing them with greater responsibility and independence in projects. Mr. Xu said Huawei has an advantage at its mobile business because the company develops its own chip sets for its devices, reducing costs and providing a revenue stream from other handset makers. He added that Huawei wouldn't seek to increase its presence in the highly competitive handset market at the risk of incurring losses. The company has said it hopes to triple handset sales this year from 20 million in 2011. Earlier this week, Huawei said its net profit fell 53% to 11.65 billion yuan last year amid the strong yuan and increased investment expenditures.

201204,A Strong Signal For Ericsson Shares,"Ericsson wants a bite of the Apple. Sales of handsets like the iPhone are booming, but Ericsson's customers—the telecom operators that allow them to function—are still reining in their network investment. Ericsson's operating profit fell 56% in the first quarter, stripping out the sale of its stake in the Sony Ericsson handset business. Still, if its margins hold steady from here, there is plenty for investors to get their teeth into. Ericsson is having a tough year. In Europe, mobile operators hit by falling sales are modernizing existing networks rather than building new ones. In the U.S., sales of Ericsson's network equipment running CDMA technology are down 40%. In India sales fell 55%, as regulatory uncertainty and tax changes spooked the telecom industry. Lower hardware sales and less profitable network upgrades and servicing led Ericsson's gross margins down 5 percentage points on the previous year, to 33.3%. Still, that is an improvement on the fourth quarter, and came in two percentage points above market expectations. The beginning of the year often sees a boost to margins with the start of new projects, but if it represents a trough level for the group, consensus earnings expectations this year look 20% too low, estimates Sanford Bernstein. Taking on low-margin network modernization projects that others have shunned also boosted Ericsson's share of the global mobile infrastructure market to 38%, from 32% the previous year. That is widened its lead over rivals Huawei, ZTE and Nokia Siemens Networks and could put it in a good position with customers when spending picks up. That may be soon. Data traffic on smartphones like the iPhone is roughly doubling every year, putting strain on networks. Network infrastructure spending is cyclical, and mobile operators globally will need to invest $100 billion in the next five years on network upgrades, the industry's trade body estimates. Meanwhile, Ericsson's shares have fallen 10% this year, and now trade at around 14 times forward earnings, well below the 16 times at which ZTE trades. For investors, this could be a good time to get their teeth in. Write to Hester Plumridge at Hester.Plumridge@dowjones.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201204,Envivio Loses Early Gains,"Telecommunications software specialist Envivio Inc. made modest early trading gains Wednesday after pricing its IPO below its expected range. The company's stock opened at $9.35 a share on the Nasdaq, up 3.9% from its initial public offering price of $9. But by late afternoon, shares were changing hands at $8.49, down 5.7%. A total of 7.8 million shares were sold at a price below its expected $10 to $12 range. Envivio's lowered pricing shows that investors continue to be selective about the IPO valuations they are willing to accept, even in the technology sector. Tech IPOs have generally fared well this year, with data analysis software firm Splunk Inc. rising 109% on its first day of trading last week. But Envivio's customer base and revenue growth isn't as high as Splunk's, and its software's target market of telecom and content providers is far narrower than Splunk's broad appeal to companies that want to collect and analyze their computer-generated data. Envivio fared batter than two IPOs that were also supposed to launch Wednesday, but failed to price. China Auto Rental Inc. postponed its deal indefinitely and Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc. is going to try again this week. Neither was expected to be a hit; investors have been spurning anything Chinese over the past year, and early-stage drug developers often struggle to draw interest. Envivio is the first of two tech deals expected this week; the other, digital marketing company Acquity Group Ltd., is scheduled to trade Friday. Envivio makes software to process and distribute Internet protocol-based video. Its customers—telecom companies and content providers—use the software to provide consumers with video on a range of devices, from smartphones to laptops. The company's software uses video compression and IP video networking technology that runs on industry standard hardware. Its software has been sold to more than 300 companies to date in more than 50 countries. About 71% of its revenue is derived from customers outside the U.S. Envivio was founded in January 2000 by a group of software and electrical engineers from France Telecom SA, which agreed to provide Envivio with MPEG-4 software developed over four years at France Telecom, as well as royalty-free licenses to several patents. In exchange, France Telecom received convertible preferred shares that represented 10% of Envivio's outstanding stock at that time. Even though the MPEG-4 technology is now widely available because it is an industry standard, Envivio says it has made proprietary developments to its software that it claims differentiates it from competitors. In fiscal 2012—the company's fiscal year ends Jan. 31—Envivio's revenue rose 69%, to $51 million, and it earned net income of $138,000 compared with a loss of $2.5 million a year earlier. Although it didn't lose money in fiscal 2012, the company has a history of losses since its inception in 2000. The company operates in a competitive environment and warns that the average sales prices of its products may decrease. Rivals include companies focused on more traditional broadcast delivery, such as Harmonic Inc., and those focused on multiscreen encoding, such as Cisco Systems Inc. and RGB Networks Inc.

201204,Bullish on Indonesia; Lippo Group Chief Says He Expects Consumers to Keep Spending,"JAKARTA, Indonesia—The growing middle class here continues to spend at an unprecedented rate, undaunted by the slowdown in global growth or by infrastructure and policy gridlock at home, business leaders say. James Riady, chief executive of Lippo Group—one of Indonesia's largest conglomerates, with a range of interests including property and supermarkets—says there have been no signs of a slowdown in the spending by Indonesians that helped give Southeast Asia's largest economy one of the world's strongest growth rates last year. Economists warn that Indonesia's growth could hit a wall soon, since President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's coalition government has been unable to build much-needed infrastructure or pass important economic and political changes. Standard & Poor's—the last major ratings service to rate Indonesian debt as junk—on Monday decided not to upgrade the country's credit rating, citing ""policy slippages,"" such as the government's failure to raise fuel and electricity prices. Still, spending doesn't seem to be slipping, Mr. Riady says. Whether it is shoppers at the company's malls, subscribers to its television and broadband services or home buyers at its apartment complexes, Lippo Group continues to see strong growth and expects it to continue for the next five years as wealth spreads to the Indonesian archipelago's far-flung islands. ""We are entering a golden era where consumers are just starting to enjoy more than just the basics,"" Mr. Riady said in an interview Monday. ""It's propelling consumer sales to amazing new levels."" Indonesia's increasingly confident consumers are a primary reason why its gross domestic product rose 6.5% last year and could climb around the same pace this year. Unlike many of its Asian neighbors, Indonesia isn't dependent on exports for growth, so it has been able to shine while other Asian economies have struggled as their customers in the U.S. and Europe suffered. Continued consumer confidence here will help decide whether the country can become the next great boom market in Asia, after China and India, economists say. If measured by the number of people that make at least $3,000 a year, Indonesia's middle class made up 50 million of its nearly 250 million people in 2009, and that will triple to 150 million by 2014, according to investment firm PT Nomura Indonesia. Motorcycle sales, for example, jumped to more than eight million last year, more than double the level five years earlier. Middle-class spending will continue to climb, and power the Indonesian economy over the next five to 10 years, says Fauzi Ichsan, senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Jakarta. Indonesia's population is young, with a median age of 28.2 years, according to the CIA Factbook. That means a growing percentage of the population will be in the working and spending periods of their lives relative to those who are retired. Meanwhile, the banking sector is just taking off and as the sector expands, it will become easier for average Indonesians to get loans to pay for their new lifestyles. Mr. Riady says Lippo Group's home sales, largely to the middle class, will be around $450 million this year, up from $100 million two years ago. He says sales at the group's hypermarkets will rise 40% this year from last and sales at its department stores will increase 25%. Mr. Riady predicts similar growth rates for the next three years. As the middle class demands better health care, Lippo Group is building hospitals across the country. The group plans to have 14 hospitals by year-end and add around 10 a year for the foreseeable future. Given new private and government investment in hospitals, Philips Electronics NV says it expects its annual health-care equipment sales in Indonesia—which are already growing faster than in China and India—to more than quadruple in the next three years. ""It's really exciting growth,"" coming from all over the country, says Wayne Spittle, Asia-Pacific head for Philips Healthcare. Some economists warn that the market could be overheating, putting too many cars on the road and pushing up property prices. Indeed, the central bank last month ratcheted up restrictions on loans for motorcycles, mortgages and cars. Still, rising incomes are expected to continue to boost demand for a variety of items, from smartphones, to refrigerators, to cut-price airline tickets. ""We have passed $3,000 GDP per capita, which has been a benchmark beyond which people are starting to have real money to spend,"" and that is creating more growth and new businesses, Mr. Riady says.

201204,Ericsson Profit Hit by Operator Caution,"STOCKHOLM—Swedish wireless network company Ericsson Wednesday reported a steep fall in first quarter operating profit, hit by slower spending by telecom operators due to economic uncertainty. ""Sales of high-performance mobile broadband developed well in North America, Japan and Korea, while other regions such as Europe including Russia, parts of Middle East and India were weaker,"" Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said. Net profit was 8.95 billion Swedish kronor ($1.33 billion), boosted by a 7.7 billion kronor gain from the sale of its 50% stake in Sony Ericsson, its former handset joint venture with Sony Corp. Net profit in the year earlier period was 4.1 billion kronor. Operating profit, excluding the Sony Ericsson sale, fell to 2.8 billion kronor from 6.3 billion kronor a year ago, while revenue fell slightly to 50.97 billion kronor from 52.97 billion kronor the same quarter last year. Ericsson has benefited from increased mobile data traffic—a result of booming sales of data-hungry smartphones—but revenue growth has slowed as operators rein in spending on costly wireless networks amid economic uncertainty. The company's closely watched gross margin fell to 33.3%, from 38.5% a year earlier, a result of its having entered into a large number of low-margin network upgrade contracts in Europe which Ericsson hopes will become more profitable in the future. Ericsson entered the contracts as a way to regain market share in Europe, and figures disclosed in February showed that the company increased its share of the mobile network infrastructure market to 38% by late last year, from 32% in May, although the gain has come at the expense of its profitability. North American sales fell 3% on the year in the first quarter, continuing to be dragged down by lower sales to the U.S. CDMA network, a radio communication standard common in the country, as carriers shift toward the next-generation long-term-evolution standard. However, Ericsson said HSPA capacity sales and a continued build-out of 4G coverage more than offset the major decline in CDMA sales.

201204,"Apple Rides iPhone Frenzy; Quarterly Profit Nearly Doubles as Tech Giant Taps China, New Markets","Apple Inc.'s quarterly profit nearly doubled as iPhones and iPads continued to fly off shelves, putting to rest recent worries that the company can't maintain its momentum. Shares gained more than 7%, or $40.55, to $600.83 in after-hours trading Tuesday—after falling in 10 of the past 11 regular trading sessions amid concerns about a potential iPhone slowdown. Instead, iPhone shipments jumped 88% in the quarter, as Apple continued to penetrate new markets like China. Apple is the most valuable company, but it isn't the best gauge of the health of the global economy. Overall corporate earnings results have been strong but uneven: General Electric Co. said last week that its operating earnings were up; International Business Machines Corp. reported a higher profit, but a drop in sales of computer hardware raised questions about technology spending by businesses and governments. Apple's success comes as it rides the proliferation of smartphones that are reshaping the technology landscape. But unlike some other players, Apple is also driving the changes with products it is able to convince consumers and businesses to buy despite a sluggish economy. In particular, Apple's gains have come at the expense of one-time giants such as Research In Motion Ltd. The quarter's results also suggest that Apple is on its way to doing what the 36-year-old company has yet to do: build a product that has strong and steady demand world-wide. Its Macs and to some degree iPods haven't taken off around the world the way that its iPhone is proving it can. Meanwhile, Chief Executive Tim Cook has taken steps to deal with Apple's growing scale. In March, he said he would put Apple's cash pile, long a subject of consternation among shareholders, to use via a dividend and stock buyback. Apple said it would issue the dividend in the quarter beginning in July and begin a $10 billion share-repurchase program the following quarter. Still, analysts said Apple's stock could go on a bumpy ride in coming months, particularly as competitors like Nokia Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. rush to market with devices during a window when Apple isn't expected to push a new phone. Analysts predict Apple will launch its next iPhone in the fall, about a year after the 4S model. Expectations for Apple's stock are still lofty, with some analysts having 12-month price targets approaching $1,000 a share. Over the quarter, the nearly five-year-old iPhone remained Apple's key driver. Apple said it sold 35.1 million of the smartphones, up from 18.65 million units a year ago. The device and related products and services formed 57.9% of Apple's sales, up from 52.7% last quarter. The company said its latest iPhone is now available in more than 100 countries and at 230 wireless carriers, up from 90 countries and 186 carriers as of March last year. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said iPhone sales in greater China were five times the level of the year-ago quarter. The results were an encouraging sign of how the hit device would fare outside the U.S., particularly in less affluent countries where smartphone growth is increasingly shifting. ""Smartphone growth domestically is slowing because we have reached a saturation point,"" said Peter Misek, a managing director at Jefferies & Co. He said Apple should be well-positioned in other markets given the strength of luxury brands in countries like China. The Cupertino, Calif., company posted a 94% profit jump to $11.6 billion and a 58.9% revenue increase to $39.2 billion for the first three months of the year from a year earlier. While the numbers showed a slight deceleration from growth rates the quarter before, the results were well above analyst estimates of $9.52 billion in profits on revenue of $36.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales of the iPad over the quarter were lower than some analysts had forecast, but up more than 150% from a year ago to 11.8 million units. Apple introduced a new iPad model during the quarter. Mr. Oppenheimer said Apple is ""selling the new iPad as fast as we can make them."" Demand, he said, is ""staggering."" Apple also sold four million Macs during the quarter, up 7% from a year ago. Meanwhile, iPod sales continued to decline, with 7.7 million units sold in the quarter, down 15% from a year ago. During the call, Mr. Cook gave his strongest public hint yet that he'd be willing to settle the sprawling legal battles started by his predecessor Steve Jobs. ""I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it,"" he said. Apple and Samsung recently agreed to enter settlement talks in a California patent case. Mr. Cook also brushed off some competitors' approaches. When asked about whether Apple's tablets and laptops might converge—a model Microsoft is pushing with Windows 8—he said: ""You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user."" Apple's guidance for the current quarter ending in late June—revenue of about $34 billion and earnings per share of $8.68—was lower than analysts expected, as it usually is. Mr. Oppenheimer said the numbers reflect how the company was able to fulfill demand for the latest devices more quickly, minimizing the spillover of sales into the next quarter. Apple's cash hoard grew to $110.2 billion as of March 31, up from $97.6 billion at the end of December. Its closely watched gross margin, rose to 47.4% from 41.4% a year earlier. Write to Jessica E.

201204,Nokia Credit Rating Cut To 'Junk',"Fitch Ratings cut Nokia Corp.'s long-term credit rating to ""junk"" status Tuesday amid growing concerns over the Finnish handset maker's financial position, marking the second downgrade in as many weeks. Fitch downgraded the company to double-B-plus with a negative outlook from an investment-grade rating of triple-B-minus after earnings from Nokia's key Devices and Services unit declined rapidly in the first quarter, and Nokia said its operating margin would be negative 3% or weaker through the second quarter. The downgrade comes after a tough few years for the company when it has seen an erosion of its dominant position as the world's largest handset maker. It has lost out in the high-margin smartphone sector to Apple Inc.'s iPhone, while phones using Google Inc.'s Android software are hitting both the high end and, increasingly, the cheaper end of the market. Nokia's net cash position has fallen by 709 million euros ($932.9 million) since the end of 2011, despite a $250 million payment from Microsoft Corp., as it struggles with a strategy overhaul that will see it adopt Windows software in all its new smartphones. Its net cash position stood at 4.87 billion euros at the end of the first quarter, reflecting a steep increase in working capital, and was down 24% from a year earlier. Moody's Investors Service last week lowered Nokia's credit rating to one notch above junk, a term applied to high-yield bonds that rating companies consider speculative. Moody's cited a sharp decline in mobile-phone sales and competition from makers of low-end phones. The move came after Nokia reported a third net loss in a row in the three months to March 31 of 929 million euros, compared with a net profit of 344 million euros a year earlier. Timo Ihamuotila, Nokia's chief financial officer, said the company's financial position remains strong and it is quickly taking action to lower its cost structure, improve cash flow and maintain a strong financial position. Nokia earmarked close to 14,000 job losses last year in a bid to cut 1 billion euros from its operating costs by 2013. It hasn't ruled out further cuts and last week said it plans to accelerate and substantially deepen cost savings for its Devices and Services unit. It said it would give further details soon. Mr. Ihamuotila said last week that Nokia might sell some of its assets and highlighted parts of its large patent portfolio as one possible area for sales. Observers have also pointed to the potential sale of Nokia's Vertu luxury mobile-phone division, whose success has been driven by strong demand from wealthy customers in places such as Russia and the Persian Gulf. Fitch said the launch of Nokia's new Windows-based Lumia 900 phone with AT&T Inc. in the U.S., as well as potential launches of new Nokia products later in the year, could improve Nokia's credit profile, though there are several factors that could delay or even ""fully impede a recovery.""

201204,Heard on the Street / Financial Analysis and Commentary,"Nokia Looks Cheap but Not Attractive Low prices haven't attracted customers to Nokia and BlackBerry phones. Cheap share prices likely won't attract buyers for the companies that make them -- at least not any time soon. Nokia stock is setting new multiyear lows and Fitch on Tuesday downgraded its debt to ""junk"" status. Meanwhile, free-falling Research In Motion, which makes the BlackBerry, is exploring strategic options. Both of their stock prices have fallen more than 90%. But there are just too many reasons not to buy them. Start with the prices. Even after a valuation collapse, Nokia and RIM have market capitalizations of $13.5 billion and $7 billion, respectively. Tack on a 30% takeover premium and they are still big mouthfuls for anybody. The bigger problem is that neither has hit bottom. After all but ceding the North American market, each could still point to success in emerging markets. But local players offering cheap smartphones are now gobbling up that business, too. In response, Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop says his company plans to ""drive the prices of . . . Lumia devices deeply down"" in order to compete with Asian rivals in emerging markets. Lumia is Nokia's new brand of devices running Microsoft's mobile operating system. The hope is that Lumia can save the company. RIM, meanwhile, is releasing its own cheap devices to try to maintain share. Yet cutting prices to fight for the bottom of the smartphone market probably isn't a recipe for long-term success, not to mention that profit margins for both companies should suffer as a result. Microsoft is mentioned as a potential buyer for both companies. But why should Microsoft pay dearly for a mobile-phone franchise in terminal decline? Microsoft already has what it wants from Nokia, which is ditching its own mobile operating system, called Symbian, for Windows. One reason some think Microsoft would buy RIM would be to get a foothold with RIM's core enterprise phone buyers. But RIM is even losing some of this market as more enterprises let workers use their own iPhone or Android devices on corporate networks. The decline of Nokia's and RIM's hardware businesses also implies that any buyer would have to pay up to restructure them, adding to the cost of any acquisition. There is also the mess involved with integration. And perhaps most importantly, there is no reason to think that Microsoft or other rumored buyers like Amazon or Facebook have the skill set needed to turn around a foundering hardware company. A wild card is intellectual property. Both RIM and Nokia have patents that would probably be valuable to an acquirer. Yet these could be scooped up cheaper later. Right now, the onus is on Nokia and RIM to heal themselves. -- Rolfe Winkler and Hester Plumridge Beware Stealth Power of Bond Indexes What drives government-bond markets? Growth, inflation, central-bank actions and government policy are the orthodox answers. But as both South Africa and Portugal have discovered, bond indexes have a lot of clout, too, because of the sway they have over investment portfolios. Take South Africa. Last week, its 10-year government-bond yields fell 0.22 percentage point in a day -- a big move in the bond world -- after Citigroup said the country was on track to join its World Government Bond Index in October. South Africa passed three key tests for WGBI membership: It has more than $50 billion of bonds outstanding, is rated at least A3 by Moody's or single-A-minus by Standard & Poor's, and doesn't raise barriers for foreign investors. For emerging markets, membership in an index can help provide more stable access to financing. There is an estimated $2 trillion to $4 trillion of funds benchmarked against the WGBI. Since joining the index in October 2010, Mexico has seen the share of foreign ownership of its government bonds nearly double to 29%. Index membership may reduce the risk of an unjustified ""sudden stop"" in financing. But membership is also a double-edged sword. Greece and Portugal were both ejected from the WGBI after credit-rating downgrades to below investment-grade status. Exclusion can also lead to a ""cliff"" effect as index investors are forced to sell into a market where few are likely to be buying. When Portugal left the index at the end of January, prices of 10-year bonds plunged and yields soared three percentage points to 17.5%. Yields have since fallen sharply, but Portugal's hopes of returning to the bond market are likely to be stymied in part by its lack of index membership. In the end, any rules-based system is open to arbitrage. The euro crisis has exposed limitations in index construction, including the role of credit ratings and the weighting of countries in an index by the amount of debt outstanding. Investors need to be wary: Indexes may be vital tools for measuring performance, but they can shape performance, too. -- Richard Barley Shell Dives Into a Pricey African Cove Royal Dutch Shell may have found a harbor in Cove Energy. Its $2 billion offer for the exploration company, whose main asset is an 8.5% stake in a huge gas field called the Rovuma Basin off the Mozambique coast, has been accepted by Cove's board. Cove shareholders stand to net a fine 96% premium to its share price before a bid process began in early January -- and Shell's offer could still be trumped by Thailand's state-owned PTT Exploration. So why is Shell prepared to pay so much? Oil majors are desperate to gain a foothold in areas like East Africa, a region rich in potential reserves and close to energy-hungry Asian markets. But such areas also attract state-owned oil companies, which are often more interested in securing supply rather than high investment returns. PTT proposed a 220 pence per share offer in February. Shell is matching that bid and compensating Cove shareholders for a 12.8% capital-gains tax introduced by the Mozambique government this month, making its offer nearly 250 pence per share. That values Cove at roughly 80 cents per thousand cubic feet (mcf) of recoverable gas reserves, assuming Rovuma's actual reserves are at the mid-point of estimates. That's well above the 33-50 cent price range Shell aims to pay for acquisitions, and over double the average for global pre-development LNG deals in recent years, according to IHS Herold data. Still, if gas prices in Asia stay around $16 per mcf, Shell should achieve a healthy return on investment, even after spending an estimated extra $2.4 billion in developing Rovuma. But gas prices can fall sharply, as they have in the U.S. since the shale gas revolution. This is a small deal for Shell, worth less than 1% of its market capitalization. Even so, investors will be relieved if the bidding war really has ended. -- Andrew Peaple Overheard It was quick work in the U.K. on Tuesday. The sale of 40-year gilts by syndication set a record for speed, the country's Debt Management Office said. It opened order books at 9:00 a.m. GMT, and more than GBP 5 billion in orders had rolled in by 9:10 a.m. The order process was wrapped up by 9:48 a.m. with GBP 9.8 billion in orders, allowing the U.K. to issue GBP 4.75 billion of the bonds, GBP 500 million more than needed to keep the issuance program on track. What is more, foreign investors took 12% of the deal, more than usual given the normal home for long-dated gilts is U.K. pension funds and insurance companies. A reassuring result all round. But the U.K. faces a long haul yet: Issuance this fiscal year will total GBP 164.4 billion, and so far the DMO has placed GBP 17.6 billion.

201204,HTC Losing Grip in U.S. Amid Stiff Competition,"TAIPEI -- Smartphone maker HTC Corp., warning that it may have permanently lost its grip on the U.S. market, said its sales and profitability will fall this quarter amid tougher competition. The Taiwan-based company built a following in the U.S. by being one of the first to sell smartphones powered by Google Inc.'s Android operating system. It was the top seller of Android-based smartphones in the U.S. in 2010, with a market share of 11.8%, but lost the top spot to Samsung Electronics this year. Chief Executive Peter Chou said strong competition from Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4S in the U.S. has hurt HTC's earnings in the last two quarters. ""It's difficult to recover our market share in the U.S.,"" Mr. Chou said in an online forum Tuesday. HTC didn't disclose its revenue breakdown by region, but analysts said the U.S. accounted for about half of the company's revenue last year and about 40% of HTC's smartphone shipments. The U.S. won't be HTC's largest market this year, as the company aims to increase its presence in Asia and Europe, Mr. Chou said. The Taiwanese company, which started out as a contract manufacturer and began to make phones under its own brand in 2006, forecast second-quarter revenue of around 105 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$3.56 billion), down from NT$124.4 billion a year earlier, but recovering from NT$67.79 billion in the first quarter. The company projected second-quarter gross profit margin of 27%, compared with 28.8% a year earlier. HTC's first-quarter margin was 25%. ""We are confident in the company's future,"" Mr. Chou said Tuesday. ""We have seen encouraging growth momentum in the second quarter.""

201204,UPDATE 2-Google trial docs show plans for growth past search,"* Google's TV, commerce projections seen as ""ambitious"" * Court documents provide rare insight into search giant * Emerging threat from Facebook, Bing (Adds analyst comments, more details from documents) By Dan Levine and Alexei Oreskovic April 25 (Reuters) - Google Inc projected in 2010 it would get more than 35 percent of its 2013 revenue from outside its flagship search operation, anticipating three non-search businesses, including commerce, would generate more than $5 billion each, according to internal company documents filed in court. The documents provide a rare insight into Google's mindset and reflect the Internet company's ambitious plans to expand into new markets, underscoring the challenges it has faced in its efforts to break its reliance on its search business. Online commerce and an initiative to bring Google services to television were important pillars of Google's growth plans at the time, the documents show. But analysts say neither appear to be on track to deliver the kind of pay-off Google expected. ""Google TV and commerce ambitions look aggressive compared to what we believe they are today,"" said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Herman Leung, who reviewed the Google documents. The projections for Google's various businesses were part of a presentation to Google's board of directors compiled by company staffers in October 2010. They were revealed during the high-stakes trial of Oracle Corp against Google over smartphone technology. Google attempted to convince U.S. District Judge William Alsup to keep the internal documents secret, but Alsup denied the request in court last week. Google spokesman Jim Prosser said on Wednesday the documents do not represent current thinking about its business operations. ""Our industry continues to evolve incredibly fast and so do our aspirations for our various products and services,"" he said. Still, the presentation provides a window into Google's strategic thinking at a time when the Web's dominant search engine was facing competitive pressure on numerous fronts. Google highlighted the emerging threat from an alliance between social networking service Facebook and Microsoft's Bing search engine, noting that ""Facebook-Bing users may bypass Google."" Google also said revenue from its business selling software to companies was ""disappointing."" Oracle has accused Google's Android mobile operating system o f violating its intellectual property rights. An Oracle spokeswoman d e clined to comment on the internal Google pr o jections. Oracle attorney David Boies briefly referred to the documents on Wednesday while questioning Android mobile software chief Andy Rubin, but Boies did not delve into the projections. However, a full copy of the internal documents has been formally admitted into evidence in the case. FAILED TO CATCH ON Google's YouTube business was estimated to generate $5 billion by 2013, thanks to a $3 billion contribution from Google TV, a then-new product that allows consumers to access Google services such as search and YouTube videos on their television screens. But analysts say Google TV has failed to catch on with consumers. Logitech, one of Google's initial partners that developed a set-top box offering the service, said in November it would cease making Google TV devices. In January, Google announced plans for new devices from LG and Samsung. Google projected that commerce, a category that includes sales of digital content and mobile payments as well as product ads, would deliver $5 billion in revenue in 2013. Google had forecast its total revenue in 2013 would be $55 billion, according to the documents, with $34 billion in revenue from its search business. Eric Schmidt was Google's CEO at the time the documents were created. In April 2011, Schmidt handed the reins to Google co-founder Larry Page, who has moved swiftly to pull the plug on projects that are not paying off while focusing efforts on opportunities including mobile, social networking and display advertising. Google's efforts to tap new revenue have been closely watched by investors, eager for new growth as the search business matures yet wary of initiatives that threaten margins. Shares of Google, which closed Tuesday's regular trading session at $609.72, are down roughly 6.6 percent in 2012. Google was also optimistic about its plans to enter the music business. In a separate set of documents in the case, the company forecast music sales would drive Android revenue to $3.7 billion in 2013. Estimating the ratio of Google's search and other businesses is complicated because of the limited information Google discloses about its various businesses. A n alysts' estimates for Google's non-search business currently range from 10 percent of the company's revenue to as much as 25 percent. ""Their core business has done better than they were forecasting. Search is growing faster than 10 percent a year,"" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at RW Baird. Google still has work to do in areas like commerce, he said. The 2010 documents show Google's search business generated $19.2 billion in 2009, while the display business brought in $3.2 billion that year. YouTube made $300 million, while e-commerce brought in no revenue. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Oracle America, Inc v. Google Inc, 10-3561.

201204,Nintendo's hard choices for a soft landing,"TOKYO, April 26 (Reuters) - In 2006 Nintendo took video gaming out of the kids' room and into the living room, as its hit Wii created a new niche as the console the whole family could share. But with that Wii boom waning, the successor being prepared by the creator of Super Mario looks like a losing proposition as Apple Inc and other smartphone and tablet makers take gaming to the bathroom, the commuter bus and back to the bedroom. Nintendo will report on Thursday its first ever operating loss, after estimating a 45 billion yen deficit for the business year just ended. ""They have been beaten by smartphones and tablets, in particular, for consumers spending and, more importantly, time,"" said David Gibson, an analyst for Macquarie in Tokyo. The company, which began in 1889 making playing cards in the back streets of Kyoto, has been hammered by a precipitous drop-off in sales of its Wii, DS handheld console and its new 3DS version. A year ago Nintendo expected to sell 13 million Wii consoles, 16 million 3DS handhelds and 11 million DS machines in the financial year. In January it slashed its sales target for all three, lopping 3 million off its Wii target, 2 million off 3DS and halving its prediction for the DS. Promising to return his company to profit this business term, Nintendo's boss, Satoru Iwata, blamed dismal sales on a strong yen and economic gloom in Europe. No strategic rethink or change to plans for the new Wii console, the Wii U, was necessary, he insisted. Yet what Nintendo faces is a fundamental shift in gaming habits that analyst argue may require it to shrink its hardware business and instead chase profits for Super Mario and other game titles on devices built by other firms. Its emerging foe is Apple, already the nemesis of flagging Japanese titan Sony Corp, whose seamless go-anywhere devices - the iPhone, iPad and rumoured plans for a games controller and ""iTV"" - are positioning it to grab swathes of the gaming market where Nintendo once held sway. In a report this month, Macquarie's Gibson pointed to a recent survey by mobile gaming site MocoSpace. It asked 15,000 gamers where they gamed; 53 percent said they played in bed, 41 percent in the living room, 72 percent commuting and 5 percent on the toilet. Yet a game started on a Wii can't be continued on a DS on the way to work or school. The Wii U, slated to go on sale in time for the year-end shopping season, does not address that convergence hurdle. Nintendo will have to sell the new console for as much as $350 to break even, estimates Nanako Imazu, an analyst for CLSA in Tokyo. That is $100 more than it charged for the Wii in 2006 and would outstrip both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which can be picked up for less than $300. BACK IN THE BLACK Imazu said Nintendo, which earns about four-fifths of its revenue overseas, should get a boost this business term from a weaker yen and the launch of popular game titles including Mario Party 8 and the latest installment of Dragon Quest from Square Enix. That should result in an operating profit of around 40 billion yen for the 12 months to March 31 - according to the average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S - back into the black, although well below the earning power it displayed during the Wii boom. Nintendo will also likely have a year's grace to woo core gamers to the Wii U, say analysts, before Sony's anticipated launch of its PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's updated Xbox at the end of 2013. Nintendo, nonetheless, will still have to contend with the rising flood of smartphones and iPhones. ""Nintendo has to deal with the change and let Mario games be played on non-Nintendo devices,"" said Imazu. ""I think it will take at least couple of years to see that."" Any drastic strategy shift that would dispatch the Mario brothers into the realm of Android and Apple's iOS operating system would likely require a change at the top of Nintendo, said Macquarie's Gibson. And that likely won't happen for a couple of years until the Wii U is shown to be a clear failure, he added. Unlike money-losing Sony, where time is running out to counter the pounding it's getting from Apple and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, Nintendo, sitting on oodles of cash it made selling the Wii - about $14 billion - at least has time to mull its choices. ""With its 8,000 yen a share in cash, it can afford to still make a bet that its hardware will sell,"" said Gibson.

201204,"In Canada, phones poised to challenge credit cards","* First commercial launches likely within six months * Telecoms seek flat fee to put card data on phones * Existing tap-and-go network removes major obstacle * Loyalty programs, coupons expected to encourage use By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, April 25 (Reuters) - Thousands of Canadian retailers already have equipment in place to let customers pay for purchases with a swipe of their mobile phones, putting the country in the lead in developing a system that could one day make cash obsolete. All that's needed is an agreement between banks, credit card companies and telecoms, and that appears to be coming soon, promising to transform how Canadians pay for everything from their morning coffee to a tankful of gasoline. If consumers embrace the system - and that's still a big ""if"" - clip-and-save coupons, transit passes, library cards and perhaps even driver's licenses could become things of the past. ""It is truly ground-breaking and revolutionary,"" said Stephen Gardiner, a managing partner for strategy at Accenture PLC, a consultancy that advises companies on mobile commerce. JUMP INTO LEAD Canada is not the first country to try such a project. Phone companies, credit card providers and banks in Britain, Japan and South Korea have tried to set up mobile payment systems, but none have yet lived up to the hype. In South Korea, for example, residents have used touch-and-go mass transit cards for years. But only a limited number of stores can process such transactions and phone-based payments have yet to take off. In Britain, European Union regulators are examining whether telecom operators working together to set up a mobile payments system are violating competition rules, while Japanese consumers have yet to be tempted away from credit and debit cards. ""In Canada, we are more ready than probably any country in the world,"" said David Robinson, who heads the emerging business team at Rogers Communications Inc, the country's largest wireless provider. He expects to launch a ""mobile wallet"" within six months. NEAR-FIELD COMMUNICATION A plus for Canada is that many Canadians either already own the kind of advanced smartphones needed for such transactions or will soon, given the rapid rate at which Canadians upgrade. The phones have chips that allow data to be exchanged wirelessly, meaning they can communicate with the sophisticated electronic readers already in shops from coast to coast. The readers, most of them in fast food outlets, gasoline stations, grocery and convenience stores and coffee shops, work with near-field communication chips embedded in credit or debit cards. NFC chips are a safer alternative to the easily hacked traditional magnetic strips. Research firm Berg Insight expects 100 million handsets to be shipped this year with an NFC chip. Electronic readers only need a software update to work with these phones. Canada already has more mobile-ready contact-less readers per capita than anywhere else in the world, with this type of reader installed in between 12 and 15 percent of all retail outlets, according to Almis Ledas, chief operating officer of EnStream. EnStream, a joint venture of Canada's three main telecom carriers, plans to launch a platform to connect with banks by the summer. ""Whether it's parking, or coffee, or groceries or gas, the acceptance points in Canada are much broader than they are in the United States,"" said Richard McLaughlin, senior vice-president for global products and solutions at Mastercard. TALKS IN FINAL STAGES Several people involved in negotiations between the telecom companies and the banks say Rogers and Canada's two other major carriers - BCE Inc's Bell Canada and Telus Corp - are in the final stages of talks. Telecoms want to charge a flat annual fee to allow a bank to load a consumer's financial credentials on the SIM card inside a NFC-enabled smartphone. That would allow the phone to replace a debit or credit card, but would not offer the phone company a cut of any transaction made over smartphones. Ledas says such a system could supplant automatic banking machines and perhaps lead to bank branch closures. ""Banking machines will become the payphones of the future,"" he said, noting how cellphones have largely made payphones redundant. Officials at Canada's five biggest banks declined to comment on mobile payments. The Canadian Bankers Association said it is working on a set of standards for the emerging industry. HURDLES IN THE UNITED STATES But winning consumer acceptance is not a given, and skeptics note the Japanese experience. Contact-less cards and readers are well established there, but consumers haven't taken the bait, at least in part because the phone offerings are no better than those from competing card plans. In the United States, three big carriers have struck deals with three banks for a payments venture called Isis, and have launched pilots in two small markets. But the partners must persuade millions of merchants to upgrade their payment readers to work with smartphones. And in Europe, smartphone payment systems are mostly in their early stages. In one high-profile but limited project, Visa Inc and Vodafone Group PLC are touting transactions via smartphones at the London Olympics this summer. For Rogers and others, acceptance may hinge on the extras they offer to consumers. Telecoms will likely look to loop in retailers' loyalty programs and airlines' frequent flyer programs. Links to other services, such as transit cards, health care and motor vehicle documents, could help, too. ""If there's one thing Japan can teach us, it's that we need to give people a good enough reason to start taking their phones out of their pockets when they come to the point of sale,"" said Zilvinas Bareisis, senior analyst at research firm Celent.

JUMP INTO LEAD Canada is not the first country to try such a project. Phone companies, credit card providers and banks in Britain, Japan and South Korea have tried to set up mobile payment systems, but none have yet lived up to the hype. In South Korea, for example, residents have used touch-and-go mass transit cards for years. But only a limited number of stores can process such transactions and phone-based payments have yet to take off. In Britain, European Union regulators are examining whether telecom operators working together to set up a mobile payments system are violating competition rules, while Japanese consumers have yet to be tempted away from credit and debit cards. ""In Canada, we are more ready than probably any country in the world,"" said David Robinson, who heads the emerging business team at Rogers Communications Inc, the country's largest wireless provider. He expects to launch a ""mobile wallet"" within six months. NEAR-FIELD COMMUNICATION A plus for Canada is that many Canadians either already own the kind of advanced smartphones needed for such transactions or will soon, given the rapid rate at which Canadians upgrade. The phones have chips that allow data to be exchanged wirelessly, meaning they can communicate with the sophisticated electronic readers already in shops from coast to coast. The readers, most of them in fast food outlets, gasoline stations, grocery and convenience stores and coffee shops, work with near-field communication chips embedded in credit or debit cards. NFC chips are a safer alternative to the easily hacked traditional magnetic strips. Research firm Berg Insight expects 100 million handsets to be shipped this year with an NFC chip. Electronic readers only need a software update to work with these phones. Canada already has more mobile-ready contact-less readers per capita than anywhere else in the world, with this type of reader installed in between 12 and 15 percent of all retail outlets, according to Almis Ledas, chief operating officer of EnStream. EnStream, a joint venture of Canada's three main telecom carriers, plans to launch a platform to connect with banks by the summer. ""Whether it's parking, or coffee, or groceries or gas, the acceptance points in Canada are much broader than they are in the United States,"" said Richard McLaughlin, senior vice-president for global products and solutions at Mastercard. TALKS IN FINAL STAGES Several people involved in negotiations between the telecom companies and the banks say Rogers and Canada's two other major carriers - BCE Inc's Bell Canada and Telus Corp - are in the final stages of talks. Telecoms want to charge a flat annual fee to allow a bank to load a consumer's financial credentials on the SIM card inside a NFC-enabled smartphone. That would allow the phone to replace a debit or credit card, but would not offer the phone company a cut of any transaction made over smartphones. Ledas says such a system could supplant automatic banking machines and perhaps lead to bank branch closures. ""Banking machines will become the payphones of the future,"" he said, noting how cellphones have largely made payphones redundant. Officials at Canada's five biggest banks declined to comment on mobile payments. The Canadian Bankers Association said it is working on a set of standards for the emerging industry. HURDLES IN THE UNITED STATES But winning consumer acceptance is not a given, and skeptics note the Japanese experience. Contact-less cards and readers are well established there, but consumers haven't taken the bait, at least in part because the phone offerings are no better than those from competing card plans. In the United States, three big carriers have struck deals with three banks for a payments venture called Isis, and have launched pilots in two small markets. But the partners must persuade millions of merchants to upgrade their payment readers to work with smartphones. And in Europe, smartphone payment systems are mostly in their early stages. In one high-profile but limited project, Visa Inc and Vodafone Group PLC are touting transactions via smartphones at the London Olympics this summer. For Rogers and others, acceptance may hinge on the extras they offer to consumers. Telecoms will likely look to loop in retailers' loyalty programs and airlines' frequent flyer programs. Links to other services, such as transit cards, health care and motor vehicle documents, could help, too. ""If there's one thing Japan can teach us, it's that we need to give people a good enough reason to start taking their phones out of their pockets when they come to the point of sale,"" said Zilvinas Bareisis, senior analyst at research firm Celent.

201204,"China iPhone sales surge, but can Apple protect its apps?","SHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's blowout quarterly iPhone sales in China show that a barrage of bad publicity hasn't dented demand. Now, it has to find a way to sell more smartphones in the world's biggest mobile market, without its fans jumping the paywall. iPhone sales surged in China after Apple signed up China Telecom Corp to sell the device last month - the second of the country's 'big three' carriers to get the iPhone. The biggest, China Mobile Ltd, which has over 600 million subscribers, doesn't yet have compatible technology. ""Based on what we've observed so far, we've seen a tremendous uptick in CDMA iPhones,"" said IDC analyst Wong Teck-Zhung. ""The key factor is that they signed with China Telecom and expanded their carrier operations."" Apple sells the international 3G standard iPhone through China Unicom and a CDMA version through China Telecom. China Mobile's domestic 3G standard does not have a compatible iPhone version. Cupertino, California-based Apple has faced a raft of negative publicity in China in recent years, including worker suicides at its supplier Foxconn Technology and accusations from Chinese groups blaming the U.S. firm for environmental pollution, and copyright and trademark infringement. That page appears to be turning as Apple reported a five-fold increase in iPhone sales in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in January-March, driving up its greater China revenue to $7.9 billion. Its publicity machine has also been helped by a deal with Foxconn to ensure proper working conditions at its factories. A next watershed would be a deal to sign up China Mobile to a carrier deal on the iPhone 5, expected to be released to the market in the third quarter. ""The main challenge for Apple is to penetrate China Mobile's 600 million subscribers. The numbers look pretty good now, but would be much better with China Mobile,"" said Nomura analyst Huang Leping. POTENTIAL BUMP With so many iPhones sold, it's natural that China is Apple's second-largest mobile software market by download volumes, according to a report last June by Distimo, an application marketplace analysis firm. But Apple's challenge is to find a way to stop users hacking into the iPhone's software to download free apps or solicit services from e-commerce sites to download apps at a fraction of their App Store or iTunes Store price. ""Clearly Apple's doing well in China, but could they do better by trying to clamp down on this? Sure, but in the big scheme of things, that's a 'high quality' problem for Apple to have,"" said Michael Clendenin, managing director of RedTech Advisors. For its second-quarter, Apple said its iTunes Store revenue increased by more than a third to almost $1.9 billion. Last month, it said its 25 billionth app was downloaded in China. Apple declined to comment for this story. ""Over the long term, they will figure out a way to handle it,"" C lendenin said. Early last year, Global Times, an official Chinese newspaper, reported some 50,000 illegal iTunes accounts were being sold on Taobao, an online unit of Alibaba Group. A spokesman for Alibaba Group said on Wednesday it shut down the accounts of those providing those services because of negative customer feedback and that the move had nothing to do with the legality of the services. A search by Reuters on China's largest consumer e-commerce platform Taobao Marketplace showed a large number of sellers offering iTunes or App Store gift-cards at big discounts. Asked about the legality of the service, one Taobao seller who was offering 16,000 iTunes songs for $30 said: ""What's illegal? If what I'm doing is illegal, all the books, music and entertainment online (in China) are illegal.

201204,UPDATE 2-Corning forecasts price declines to stabilize,"* EPS, revenue beat Street * Price declines to stabilize in Q2-CFO * Shares rise more than 5 pct (Adds new analyst comment, background, updates share price) By Liana B. Baker April 25 (Reuters) - Specialty glass maker Corning Inc reported a lower first-quarter profit but said it expected price declines in LCD glass to moderate significantly in the current quarter, sending shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday. After two quarters of price declines for liquid crystal display glass, one of Corning's main products that is used in televisions, Corning said it expects to set better prices with its customers. In previous quarters, Corning's main customers for its LCD business -- manufacturers such as LG Display Co Ltd and Sony Corp -- have been struggling to eke out profits in their TV units as people put off buying new flat-screen sets in a tough economy. ""For Corning, it was nice to see that LCD glass price declines weren't worse than expected,"" said Alkesh Shah, an Evercore analyst. Lower retail demand globally for LCD televisions had led to a glut of the glass, which had given Corning's customers more muscle in demanding lower prices. But Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws said negotiations with its customers in the second quarter will help it achieve more stable prices. ""It reflects supply-demand situation coming more into balance. This has been a key goal for us to get back to more moderate and consistent price declines,"" Flaws said in an interview. He added that pricing for the rest of the year is hard to predict because Corning negotiates its prices each quarter, but he is optimistic the company could see better profitability in upcoming quarters. ""Unless there is some lurking economic event, we would think demand does strengthen in the back half of the year,"" Flaws said. But Shah, the Evercore analyst, said weak ""TV demand may hurt results in the second half of 2012."" NEW MARKETS To reduce its reliance on the LCD TV market, Corning has been seeking new growth areas such as cover glass for tablets and smartphones as well as making more products for the life sciences industry. For the second quarter, Corning expects its specialty materials segment, which includes its ""Gorilla Glass"" cover glass product, to rise 10 percent to 15 percent. Sales in that unit were $288 million in the first quarter. Samsung's Galaxy Note products, Nokia's Lumia phones and Motorola's new Droid Razr contain ""Gorilla Glass."" Analysts believe it is used in Apple's iPhone and iPad. Corning has also been buying companies to boost its life sciences business. In April, it paid about $730 million for the majority of one of Becton, Dickinson & Co's biosciences units that makes lab research instruments such as tubes and Petri dishes. The cash deal will boost annual sales of Corning's life sciences unit by 40 percent. ""We like this segment a lot because it's not capital intensive and it's relatively stable throughout the year,"" Flaws said. Net income attributable to Corning fell 38 percent to $462 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with $748 million, or 47 cents a share a year earlier. This beat analyst average estimates of 28 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue for the Corning, New York-based company fell 0.2 percent to $1.92 billion in the first quarter, which beat Street estimates of $1.87 billion. Shares rose 69 cents or 5.2 percent to $14.03 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting By Liana B. Baker; Editing by Gerald E.

201204,UPDATE 1-China's ZTE Q1 net income trails forecasts,"HONG KONG, April 25 (Reuters) - China's ZTE Corp , the world's fifth-biggest telecommunications equipment maker, reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter profit following sluggish telecoms spending and price wars. ZTE and its domestic rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have cut prices to grab market share in a slowing global telecoms equipment market, a strategy that has hit profitability, analysts said. To boost margins, the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment vendors are now aiming to offer value-added services, focus on network upgrading projects and increase sales of consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs, they said. Unaudited net income was 150.87 million yuan ($23.92 million) in January to March, compared with 127.29 million yuan a year earlier, ZTE said on Wednesday. That missed an average forecast of 183 million yuan by three analysts polled by Reuters. Earlier this week, Huawei reported a 53 percent decline in its 2011 profit, even as sales grew 11.7 percent. ZTE said in March that full-year profit had dropped by a third. ""Western vendors would welcome Huawei and ZTE putting greater emphasis on margins,"" Daryl Schoolar, principal analyst for network infrastructure at research firm Ovum, said in Shenzhen. ""Probably one of the biggest complaints I get when talking to their competitors is that they win business on low prices on very favourable financial terms backed by Chinese banks."" Chinese telecoms equipment makers have received support from policy banks, such as China Development Bank, in the form of low interest rate loans for network infrastructure projects in emerging economies, according to analysts. They have also relied on preferential taxes instead of focusing on boosting profitability, analysts say. Huawei is the world's No.2 vendor, with revenue just a tad behind Sweden's Ericsson. Alcatel-Lucent SA , Nokia Siemens Networks and ZTE come next. In 2011, Huawei's overall gross profit margin fell 6.5 percentage points to 37.5 percent, while ZTE saw a drop of 2.03 percentage points to 30.26 percent with handset margins taking the biggest hit. ZTE did not specify the company's margins in its unaudited first-quarter results. ""It will be better for the overall industry if vendors compete more on services and product development, rather than prices,"" said George Sun, ZTE's vice president of corporate strategy.

201205,"RIM's Next Move? Stay, Share or Sell","Research In Motion Ltd.'s rookie chief executive is now racing the clock to stem its quickly weakening smartphone business -- or come up with options to save the BlackBerry maker. With each passing quarter, RIM's financial situation is eroding and so too are its workable alternatives. Analysts and industry executives say RIM, by not considering more radical options earlier like selling the company, has now forced itself into a make-or-break blitz to roll out its next smartphone and operating system this year. ""There are a bunch of people [within RIM] that still don't understand how dire the situation is,"" a person close to the company said. Chief Executive Thorsten Heins warned Tuesday that RIM won't make a profit this quarter, and named the bankers that have been working with the company for several months on a turnaround strategy -- a move that many analysts interpreted as a signal RIM's financial woes have ratcheted up urgency in finding a buyer. But people familiar with the matter said RIM still isn't actively shopping itself outright, and is instead focused on seeing through the launch of BlackBerry 10, a new operating system that will power both its latest BlackBerry phone and its PlayBook tablet. If RIM is successful, that might make it a more valuable acquisition target. Last year, Microsoft Corp. and Nokia Corp. considered making a joint offer for the company, but those talks never proceeded past the initial stages, according to people familiar with the situation. Other outright buyers could include Asian handset makers like HTC Corp., or online retailer Amazon.com Inc., which has jumped into the tablet business. So far, these and other potential buyers, with the cash hoard and stomach for risk that would come with a RIM tie-up, haven't made a move. RIM's stock fell 7.8% Wednesday to $10.35 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, pushing its market capitalization under $6 billion from some $40 billion early last year. An acquisition also comes with significant execution risk. Several Canadian politicians have sent mixed signals about how Ottawa would view a foreign takeover offer. ""Nobody is serious about buying RIM right now,"" said the person close to the company. Microsoft and HTC declined to comment. Representatives at Nokia and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests. A RIM spokeswoman said that RIM employees ""understand the vital importance of launching BlackBerry 10 on time at a quality that exceeds the expectations of our users."" Short of an outright sale, RIM could try to cozy up to a handset maker and license its software or open up its valuable security network. Rival device makers HTC and Samsung Electronics Co. both had talks with RIM last year about licensing RIM's forthcoming operating system, according to people familiar with the situation. But Mr. Heins canceled these licensing talks after taking over, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung didn't respond to a request for comment. RIM also owns a crop of patents which most analysts value at $2 billion to $2.5 billion. But a successful rollout of the phone is RIM's best-case scenario -- and even that will be difficult as RIM needs to impress consumers in an increasingly crowded market. Apple Inc. is expected to release its next iPhone this year, while more powerful devices using Google Inc.'s Android software are appearing each month. And recently Nokia, armed with a relatively well-reviewed Microsoft operating system, is cutting prices for its low-end devices around the world. The few details RIM has shown off to application developers -- including a new touch pad keyboard and an easy-to-use interface -- have garnered positive reviews. But so far, RIM has given no specific timeline for that launch. RIM has a still-comfortable cash cushion, upward of $2 billion, which the company said it expects to increase in the current quarter. But if losses continue, that safety margin is also under threat. RIM will need to spend heavily to push out its new phone and market it widely later this year. In recent weeks, Mr. Heins has been focused on shaking up RIM's top management, amid a parade of senior-executive departures and a handful of new c-suite hires. The company has decided it needs to cut at least 1,500 employees -- RIM had 16,500 workers as of March -- and may cut many more, according to people familiar with the matter. The RIM spokeswoman said the company isn't managing toward a specific head count. --- Anupreeta Das contributed to this article. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,Pushing All Our Buttons,"CORRECTION APPENDED IT started out in the 1950s as an effort-saving gadget, like the electric can opener or electronic car keys. It evolved into a necessity, a cultural magic wand that has transformed the relationship of viewers to their televisions, and the style and content of the programs on view. Today, American television viewers click away at some 335 million TV remotes -- nearly three per household. No longer a curiosity, the remote is as much a part of the American home as the personal computer or the cellphone. The novelist Saul Bellow denounced it as a malign invention whose invitation to jump from channel to channel, scrambling stories, ''makes mental mincemeat of us.'' Ellen Goodman called it ''the most reactionary implement currently used to undermine equality in modern marriage'' in a 1992 column for The Boston Globe, noting its resemblance to a royal scepter and the tendency of men to dictate its use. ''It really changed, in a fundamental way, our interaction with technology and with each other,'' said Edward Tenner, a historian of technology and culture and the author of ''Our Own Devices.'' ''Think of the clickers that allow us to communicate with all sorts of electronic devices. The TV remote was the origin of that idea.'' No one foresaw the transformative power of the device when Zenith unveiled the first cordless remote, the Flash-Matic, in 1955. Created by Eugene J. Polley, who died May 20 at 96, it looked like a small ray gun. By directing a beam of light at four photo cells, one at each corner of the screen, the viewer could change channels up or down, and increase or decrease the volume. The company's advertisements proclaimed the Flash-Matic ''a marvel of the electronic age that gives you remote control without wires, cables or cords.'' Unlike the Lazy Bones, Zenith's first remote, introduced in 1950, it did not have a wire connecting it to the television. But it did have other drawbacks. The photocells could be activated randomly by bright sunlight during the day, and by the lights of passing cars at night. Nevertheless, Mr. Polley regarded his device with satisfaction. ''It makes me think my life was not wasted,'' he told The Baltimore Sun in 2000. ''Maybe I did something for humanity, like the guy who invented the flush toilet.'' Robert Adler, the inventor of the Lazy Bones, carried remote technology forward with an ultrasound device called the Space Command. Viewers could press one of four buttons on a box to turn the television on and off, change channels and adjust the volume. Each key, with a sharp click, struck an aluminum rod that sent ultrasound waves to the receiver in the set. The Space Command was introduced in 1956 and lived on into the age of transistor technology in the early 1960s. With the arrival of infrared technology in the early 1980s, it became obsolete, but by that time the remote had already made deep inroads into American life. In 1965, the first year that statistics were kept on sales of televisions with remote controls, only 1 in 20 sets came with a remote control, which, because it added to the cost, came only with color models. By 1985, half of all color sets came with a remote control, and by 1988, three-quarters. For the big networks, the remote, the VCR and multiple cable channels formed an axis of evil. The ray-gun design of the Flash-Matic, it turned out, was a kind of omen. Programming executives now faced a world in which ''the audience was armed,'' as James Gleick put it in ''Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything.'' Television began to change, rapidly and profoundly, as power shifted from corporate offices to increasingly fickle viewers. After a research team at NBC discovered that 25 percent of its audience changed channels when credits rolled, the network introduced the format known as ''squeeze and tease'' in 1999. Credits were consigned to a third of the screen, running simultaneously with promotional spots intended to keep the viewers hooked. The networks either abandoned or modified strategies they had relied on for decades. Increasingly, television shows were ''top-loaded.'' That is, flashy production values were given prominence at the beginning of shows, to entice restless eyes, and commercials were moved to the middle. The transition from one show to the next became almost seamless, with viewers thrust into new narratives almost before they knew the old one had come to its end. The visual style of television became much faster and jumpier to stave off visual ennui. Viewers, for their part, enjoyed a somewhat conflicted relationship with the handy little device, which often seemed to have a mind of its own. It showed an uncanny talent for concealing itself in the deepest recesses of a sofa or wandering off to points unknown. A thriving business in electronic television-remote finders grew up overnight. As the remotes proliferated, so did the number of function keys. The devices that came with cable boxes, bristling with buttons, looked like personal massagers intended to break up cellulite. The Tito who imposed unity on this Balkanized world was the universal remote, a superwand that could be programmed to control dozens of devices. But many consumers found that it simply added a new layer of complexity to their lives, and in some cases sent them running to professional consultants for an intervention. ''The problem is, there are a billion buttons and you have no idea what they do,'' said Jeff Gernbacher, who supervises Geek Squad technicians for Best Buy in Minneapolis. ''It puts people off the technology and makes them not want to use it.'' The visual appearance of the typical remote did not help matters. ''The television remote is the iconic example of bad design,'' said Bill Moggridge, the director of the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum and the author of ''Designing Interactions.'' ''There was a great deal of original design thinking in the first modes. Flash-Matic, with its ray-gun look and red trigger, was very innovative, but modern remotes suffer from the Swiss Army knife problem. When there are as many features as possible, doing any one thing becomes very difficult and confusing.'' A new generation of universal remotes, like the Logitech Harmony series, tries to simplify matters by doing the programming automatically once users log on to a computer and, referring to an extensive menu, select the model names of the electronic devices they own. THE remote control may have liberated viewers. But it has also produced anxiety, stress and even violent conflict. In April 2011, a woman in Wellington, Fla., attacked her husband with a remote, which the police characterized as a ''deadly weapon.'' And Exulam Holman, of Joliet, Ill., was charged in January with gouging out his uncle's eyes and throwing him down a flight of stairs after a dispute over the remote. But simmering resentment is more the norm. Social scientists became intrigued by the sexual politics of the remote as the device became ubiquitous in the late 1980s. Men and women, it seemed, used it differently. Men were obsessive clickers, flipping through channels out of boredom, restlessness, the sense that something better might be on elsewhere or because they wanted to watch two programs at once. Women tuned into a specific program, which they then watched. Alexis J.

201205,Pushing All Our Buttons,"Correction Appended IT started out in the 1950s as an effort-saving gadget, like the electric can opener or electronic car keys. It evolved into a necessity, a cultural magic wand that has transformed the relationship of viewers to their televisions, and the style and content of the programs on view. Today, American television viewers click away at some 335 million TV remotes — nearly three per household. No longer a curiosity, the remote is as much a part of the American home as the personal computer or the cellphone. The novelist Saul Bellow denounced it as a malign invention whose invitation to jump from channel to channel, scrambling stories, “makes mental mincemeat of us.” Ellen Goodman called it “the most reactionary implement currently used to undermine equality in modern marriage” in a 1992 column for The Boston Globe, noting its resemblance to a royal scepter and the tendency of men to dictate its use. “It really changed, in a fundamental way, our interaction with technology and with each other,” said Edward Tenner, a historian of technology and culture and the author of “Our Own Devices.” “Think of the clickers that allow us to communicate with all sorts of electronic devices. The TV remote was the origin of that idea.” No one foresaw the transformative power of the device when Zenith unveiled the first cordless remote, the Flash-Matic, in 1955. Created by Eugene J. Polley, who died May 20 at 96, it looked like a small ray gun. By directing a beam of light at four photo cells, one at each corner of the screen, the viewer could change channels up or down, and increase or decrease the volume. The company’s advertisements proclaimed the Flash-Matic “a marvel of the electronic age that gives you remote control without wires, cables or cords.” Unlike the Lazy Bones, Zenith’s first remote, introduced in 1950, it did not have a wire connecting it to the television. But it did have other drawbacks. The photocells could be activated randomly by bright sunlight during the day, and by the lights of passing cars at night. Nevertheless, Mr. Polley regarded his device with satisfaction. “It makes me think my life was not wasted,” he told The Baltimore Sun in 2000. “Maybe I did something for humanity, like the guy who invented the flush toilet.” Robert Adler, the inventor of the Lazy Bones, carried remote technology forward with an ultrasound device called the Space Command. Viewers could press one of four buttons on a box to turn the television on and off, change channels and adjust the volume. Each key, with a sharp click, struck an aluminum rod that sent ultrasound waves to the receiver in the set. The Space Command was introduced in 1956 and lived on into the age of transistor technology in the early 1960s. With the arrival of infrared technology in the early 1980s, it became obsolete, but by that time the remote had already made deep inroads into American life. In 1965, the first year that statistics were kept on sales of televisions with remote controls, only 1 in 20 sets came with a remote control, which, because it added to the cost, came only with color models. By 1985, half of all color sets came with a remote control, and by 1988, three-quarters. For the big networks, the remote, the VCR and multiple cable channels formed an axis of evil. The ray-gun design of the Flash-Matic, it turned out, was a kind of omen. Programming executives now faced a world in which “the audience was armed,” as James Gleick put it in “Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything.” Television began to change, rapidly and profoundly, as power shifted from corporate offices to increasingly fickle viewers. After a research team at NBC discovered that 25 percent of its audience changed channels when credits rolled, the network introduced the format known as “squeeze and tease” in 1999. Credits were consigned to a third of the screen, running simultaneously with promotional spots intended to keep the viewers hooked. The networks either abandoned or modified strategies they had relied on for decades. Increasingly, television shows were “top-loaded.” That is, flashy production values were given prominence at the beginning of shows, to entice restless eyes, and commercials were moved to the middle. The transition from one show to the next became almost seamless, with viewers thrust into new narratives almost before they knew the old one had come to its end. The visual style of television became much faster and jumpier to stave off visual ennui. Viewers, for their part, enjoyed a somewhat conflicted relationship with the handy little device, which often seemed to have a mind of its own. It showed an uncanny talent for concealing itself in the deepest recesses of a sofa or wandering off to points unknown. A thriving business in electronic television-remote finders grew up overnight. As the remotes proliferated, so did the number of function keys. The devices that came with cable boxes, bristling with buttons, looked like personal massagers intended to break up cellulite. The Tito who imposed unity on this Balkanized world was the universal remote, a superwand that could be programmed to control dozens of devices. But many consumers found that it simply added a new layer of complexity to their lives, and in some cases sent them running to professional consultants for an intervention. “The problem is, there are a billion buttons and you have no idea what they do,” said Jeff Gernbacher, who supervises Geek Squad technicians for Best Buy in Minneapolis. “It puts people off the technology and makes them not want to use it.” The visual appearance of the typical remote did not help matters. “The television remote is the iconic example of bad design,” said Bill Moggridge, the director of the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum and the author of “Designing Interactions.” “There was a great deal of original design thinking in the first modes. Flash-Matic, with its ray-gun look and red trigger, was very innovative, but modern remotes suffer from the Swiss Army knife problem. When there are as many features as possible, doing any one thing becomes very difficult and confusing.” A new generation of universal remotes, like the Logitech Harmony series, tries to simplify matters by doing the programming automatically once users log on to a computer and, referring to an extensive menu, select the model names of the electronic devices they own. THE remote control may have liberated viewers. But it has also produced anxiety, stress and even violent conflict. In April 2011, a woman in Wellington, Fla., attacked her husband with a remote, which the police characterized as a “deadly weapon.” And Exulam Holman, of Joliet, Ill., was charged in January with gouging out his uncle’s eyes and throwing him down a flight of stairs after a dispute over the remote. But simmering resentment is more the norm. Social scientists became intrigued by the sexual politics of the remote as the device became ubiquitous in the late 1980s. Men and women, it seemed, used it differently. Men were obsessive clickers, flipping through channels out of boredom, restlessness, the sense that something better might be on elsewhere or because they wanted to watch two programs at once. Women tuned into a specific program, which they then watched. Alexis J. Walker, who studies the sociology of the American family at Oregon State University, examined remote-control use among 36 couples in 1996 and finished up by interviewing her subjects. “I would say that the only thing that’s frustrating for me is when we first turn on the TV and he just flips through the channels,” one woman said. “It drives me crazy because you can’t tell what’s on, because he just goes through and goes through and goes through.” But the day of liberation may be at hand. Industry experts agree that the all-powerful remote, and the complex pas de deux between thumb and button, faces obsolescence. David Mercer, a television analyst at Strategy Analytics, a research and consulting firm, has called the remote “the dinosaur of the consumer electronics industry.” Voice-recognition and motion sensors are already being incorporated into new remotes like the Samsung Magic Touch, the LG Magic Motion and the Ident Gesture Remote.

201205,A Guide to Deciphering the Language of Smartphones,"BUYING a smartphone, whether for yourself or as a gift, is a harrowing process made all the more mystifying by the language the marketers use. Every year they add new lingo and ever trickier claims — all networks can’t be the fastest, can they? Here is a glossary to help decipher what the ads and sales representatives are talking about. Some of the terms are very familiar, others arcane. 3G, 4G, WIMAX, HSPA+ These may be the most confusing terms because there is a lot of marketing mystery around them. The G stands for generation. The higher the number next to the G, the newer, and presumably faster, is the network the device is using. (To make things even more confusing, when Apple calls a product 4G, that means it is the fourth generation of that device, but not necessarily that it works on a 4G network, although sometimes it does.) Not all 4G is created equal. Different carriers use different kinds of 4G. If you are looking for speed (and who isn’t?), the technologies, rated from fastest to slowest, are LTE, WiMax and HSPA+. After that come EVDO and EDGE, which are 3G. RootMetrics, a company that measures mobile network performance, tested in 42 markets and found that the fastest provider over all was Verizon (it has the most LTE), followed by AT&T, then T-Mobile and Sprint. But there are big caveats. One is, not every city has 4G from every carrier. Another is that you need a phone that receives the 4G network, and not all do. But most of all, the speed of a network doesn’t matter if you can’t get a signal. First, find which carrier has the strongest signal where you use your phone most. (There is a RootMetrics map you can check, and you can ask neighbors about their experiences.) Choose the fastest network with good reception in your price range. TIERED PLAN Carriers talk about “tiers of service,” which are packages with varying amounts of minutes, instant messages and data. The more time and data you buy, the more you pay. Many people overpay. With unlimited plans disappearing, many people buy a top tier for peace of mind — that way, they know they will not run over and incur expensive penalties. But paying for minutes and data that aren’t used may be more expensive than the occasional penalty. The trick is to buy only what you use, with a minimal cushion, which requires an accurate accounting of what you use. A Web site called BillShrink analyzes a current bill and makes a recommendation on what plan to buy. CDMA VS. GSM These are different wireless standards: think of them as being like AM and FM on radios. Of the large carriers, Verizon and Sprint (and brands using Sprint’s network, like Virgin and Boost) are on CDMA. AT&T and T-Mobile (and its resellers) are on GSM. This matters mostly to international travelers: GSM is the standard in most of the world, so a GSM phone may be used in more places overseas. Another difference, less important to most people, is that a GSM phone keeps its identity and data, like contact lists, on a removable SIM card, which makes it easy to switch to a new phone. CDMA phones hold the phone’s identity on the network, so the information may have to be sent over the network to a new phone, which is a bit more complex. WI-FI This provides the ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network using a phone. Why would you want to? There is no charge for data transmitted by Wi-Fi. As data limits become smaller (and data charges rise), that’s a very good thing. If downloading two HD movies might eat up your monthly data limit, you could load them over Wi-Fi and leave the limit intact. APPS Apps is short for applications, another word for software or simple computer programs. Apps add functions to a phone, like maps that give audible directions, a stock ticker or a game like Angry Birds. Even for those phones with the fewest number of apps, thousands will be available. OS OS stands for operating system, the underlying software that runs the phone. The OS you get determines, among other things, the features of the phone and which apps it will run. According to market analysis by comScore, Google has the most popular OS in the United States (Android) with a 51 percent market share, followed by Apple (iOS) with 31 percent, Research in Motion (BlackBerry) with 12 percent and Microsoft (Windows) with 4 percent. The picture is a bit different when you look at customer satisfaction, as J. D. Power & Associates does. In its survey, Apple iOS was the clear favorite, followed by Windows and Android at near parity, then BlackBerry. Apple iOS has the greatest number of apps available. Often cited for its ease of use, it works easily across Apple products, and nearly does so with Windows computers as well. Android is almost as easy to use as iOS, but because there are many different versions, it doesn’t work the same way with every Android phone. That means that not all phones can run all Android apps. If you want a specific app, check to see if it works on a prospective phone before you buy. Another difference from Apple is that with Android, extra software might be needed to connect a phone to a computer for sharing a contacts list or music. The Windows OS has come a long way, with engaging “live tiles”: animated square icons that show updates, like the number of messages waiting, or the latest posts from social networks. A nice feature is that messages are threaded — strung together for continuity — even when they come from different sources. So a conversation begun on Facebook can continue by text and appear in one string. The BlackBerry still has the security features that make it beloved of corporate I.T. departments, but it has fallen from the top of the heap in consumer popularity. It has two primary features that help distinguish it from other phones. One is that most BlackBerrys still have physical keyboards, as opposed to touch screens. The other is BlackBerry Messenger, an app that allows free instant chatting between BlackBerrys anywhere in the world. BBM, as it’s known, also allows the sending of pictures, videos and voice notes.

201205,Up-to-Date Tricks for Aging Wheels,"CARS on American highways are getting older. The average vehicle is now nearly 11 years old, up from about nine years in 2001, according to the R. L. Polk automotive research company. That means many drivers in the “dads and grads” cohort are probably candidates for a technology upgrade. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for gift givers, as varied as high-tech collision warning systems and phone-related devices intended to prevent driver distraction. CELLPHONE CONTROL A recent Consumer Reports survey of drivers ages 16 to 21 found that while about 80 percent of respondents agreed that texting while driving was dangerous, roughly 30 percent conceded that they had done it. Although a variety of sophisticated solutions have been developed to prevent people from calling and texting while driving, most are easy to defeat or are overly restrictive. The Scosche Cellcontrol is an exception. It starts with a $129.95 matchbox-size device that plugs into the OBD-II diagnostics port found under the dashboard of cars made after 1996. In conjunction with an app downloaded to the user’s Android or BlackBerry phone, it senses when the car is moving and, via Bluetooth, automatically locks out certain functions, including texting, e-mail and Web browsing. It recognizes when a car is parked and will allow phone calls when a hands-free device is connected. It does not work with iPhones. If your young driver tries to circumvent it by unplugging the dongle, Cellcontrol will alert you that the system has been disabled. Even rebooting a BlackBerry, for example, to disable the connection will not work. The phone will not restart unless the owner also restores the Bluetooth settings. Unlike some other cellular lockout solutions, it will not block other phones in the car. So a passenger could still place a call. It also will not inadvertently block calls from, for example, a bus or train, because it works only in conjunction with the Cellcontrol device. GPS TRACKING The trouble with most tracking gadgets is that they rely on battery power, which means you have to remember to charge them and put them back in the car. PocketFinder Vehicle can be installed under the hood, attached to the car battery and forgotten. Using a Web browser, owners can see the car’s location, speed, and travel history on the PocketFinder service. The software allows parents to set travel boundaries and speed limits for young drivers. If they are exceeded, a text or e-mail will be sent to the parents. The initial cost is $189.95, which includes two months of service. The monthly fee is then $12.95. RADAR AND RED LIGHTS Cobra Electronics has updated its Cobra iRadar model, now the $129.95 iRAD 200. It is a low-profile dashboard detector of radar and laser traps. (Make sure that such devices are legal in your state.) Using a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone and a free iRadar app (for Android and iPhone models), it also alerts drivers to red light cameras. Fellow Cobra users can report police actions, accidents and new photo enforcement spots. The iRadar can also be set to automatically report laser alerts and share them with other iRadar owners. With a similar set of social networking features, Escort’s Live adapter allows Escort owners to upgrade their detectors. The $99.95 Bluetooth device replaces the standard power cord on compatible models and sends information to a companion iPhone or Android smartphone app. Laser and Ka band alerts can be passed along automatically and anonymously to other Live community members via the smartphone app. It will even map where and when a hit was registered and deliver color-coded graphical notes and audible alerts. The price includes a one-year subscription. It is $39.95 annually thereafter. NAVIGATION In spite of the many navigation apps for smartphones, portable navigation devices are not obsolete — yet. TomTom has added features that the socially conscious will appreciate. The reasonably priced $249.95 TomTom Go Live 1535M, for example, includes live traffic reports updated every two minutes. The service has the added benefit of gathering speed and location data in real time from other TomTom owners so that it can alert you to new congestion ahead and reroute you around it. New to this model is a suite of travel related apps, including Yelp and TripAdvisor for restaurant reviews and local recommendations. Updated fuel prices and weather information are also available. After the first year, Live services can be continued for $59.95 a year. COLLISION AND LANE MONITORS The latest technologically equipped vehicles offer advanced safety features, like collision and lane departure warnings. Now an ingenious app can add these functions to any car by using a smartphone with a camera. Called iOnRoad Augmented Driving Pro, the $4.99 program uses a phone’s video camera stream, GPS feature, accelerometer and gyroscope to monitor the car’s position on the road. A car cradle mount, which typically costs $20 to $30, is required for the phone. A power adapter cable is recommended to keep it charged. The main benefit of the app is its ability to measure a car’s distance from vehicles ahead. The stopping distance is displayed on a live video feed and is measured in seconds (or feet if you choose), progressing from green to yellow (warning) to red when you get too close. Drift too close to a line, and it will flash a lane departure warning up on the phone’s display. At its best, iOnRoad can promote better driving habits and prevent you from becoming an anxious tailgater. However, the alerts could make inexperienced drivers jumpy. It erroneously warned me, for example, that I was drifting out of my lane on several curves. It also failed to pick out a motorcycle ahead of me at night. TABLET HOLDERS Do not neglect passengers in the back seat. For them, entertainment is no longer about DVD players. It is all about iPads and tablets. A number of holders, cradles and brackets are made for specific models. A better option is the adjustable Satechi Cup Holder Mount. Its base expands to snugly fit various cup holder sizes, while its clamps adjust to hold 7- to 10-inch tablets in place. Two adjustable pivots can put the tablet in variety of positions, and the package includes a second smaller bracket for smartphones. It is a handy car accessory for just $29.99. Just remember to keep it in the back seat.

201205,"Daddy, What Were Compact Discs?","ONE day, when my children are a little older, I will gather them close and I will tell them about how I lived through the Great Format Wars. I will recount to them a seemingly endless cycle of battles. From LP to cassette to minidisk (oh wait — not to minidisk) to CD. From Betamax to VHS to DVD to HD-DVD to Blu-ray. From punchcards to magnetic tape to floppy disks to zip drives to DVD-ROMs. Some were dirty little skirmishes, like the Eight-Track Incursion of the late 1960s. But, oh, there are epic tales to be told as well: How my children’s hearts will leap and dive (assuming they are not the kind to be bored to distraction by what Dad is droning on about) as they hear about VHS and Betamax, each bringing the other ever closer to oblivion, and how only one of them left the battlefield — only to fall victim to a far nimbler opponent, DVD, which was waiting in the wings. And my children will hear of this and be amazed (see assumption above), for they know nothing of this kind of conflict. They will grow up in a world where physical storage of information is as outdated as rotary-dial telephones and mimeograph machines are now. Indeed, they already live in that world, even if vestiges of the old remain (turntables, for example). We older people can enjoy this new world as well, what with streaming music and video services, cloud-based storage options and social networks that easily absorb our photos and ephemera. We may be hardened by battles past, but our future is digital, wireless, ubiquitous and, we hope, pacific. Here’s what it looks like. Music It was not that long ago that a home-stereo system was a black-and-brown tower of components: an amplifier, a receiver, a cassette deck, a CD player, a phonograph, perhaps an equalizer. All that can be cast aside. Our music is now stored digitally on a computer, or sent over the Internet from a streaming service like Spotify or Pandora. To hear it in the home, all that’s required is a speaker to receive the necessary data. One of the simplest ways to do this is with a wireless speaker that uses Bluetooth wireless technology to connect to a smartphone or computer. The two big players in this area are Bose, with its SoundLink speaker ($300), and Jawbone, with its Jambox ($200) and Big Jambox ($300) speakers. The products vary in size and shape and have different secondary features, but their primary function is the same: to take the music that is on a computer or phone and, wirelessly, play it in a room. All three models are powered by a rechargeable battery (the Bose lasts eight hours on a charge; the Big Jambox lasts 15), so you can move them in and out of the house. Because many people store music on their phones or use it to pull in music from a streaming site, the smartphone becomes both the source and the remote control for the speaker. If a listener wants a more sophisticated package, there is also Sonos, which makes small ($300) and large ($400) indoor speakers that work on a proprietary network. When multiple speakers are set up around a house, music can be sent to all of them simultaneously, or different tracks can be sent to different rooms. Controlling the speakers can be done from a computer or via a smartphone app that works with your existing music library as well as Internet-based services. TV and Movies The VCR gave way to the DVD player, which then begot the Blu-ray DVD player, but the next device we use to watch movies will not have any disc or cartridge at all. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant Video are able to send shows and movies to televisions directly, and online stores like Apple’s iTunes Store can allow users to download videos to their devices for offline viewing. To get this content onto a television, you need either a new TV — which will probably have the ability to get on a Wi-Fi network, so it can access the Internet and reach streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu directly — or an accessory that allows your current television to do the same thing. If the latter is the case, then you may want to consider a Roku box (starting at $50) or an Apple TV ($99). Both will allow you to get online and stream content. Roku has deals with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Plus. Apple’s box will connect you to Netflix and will also gain you access to its iTunes store. If you’re a user of other Apple products, Apple TV will let you view your pictures in iPhoto on your television; it can also work with iPhones and iPads, so your TV can “mirror” what’s being shown on the tablet’s screen. If you’re playing a game on the iPad, the tablet can become the controller while your TV can become the larger display. Another way to view movies on demand is through gaming consoles. Microsoft’s Xbox (starting at $200) has its own online-video service, and in some areas, can even pull in a limited number of cable channels, supplanting not only a DVD player, but a cable box as well. Sony’s PlayStation 3 ($250) and Nintendo’s Wii ($150) gaming consoles also have the ability to pull in streaming video from popular services. Computing Early computer users may remember that the storage medium of choice in the early 1980s was a cassette of magnetic tape. This then gave way to the 5 1/4-inch floppy, which in turn evolved into the 3 1/2-inch floppy (this time protected by a hard plastic case), only to be overtaken by the CD-ROM, which morphed into the DVD. But the latest portable computers forgo any removable storage media whatsoever. In an era when documents can be stored on Google Docs, photos on Facebook and other files on cloud services like Dropbox, the need for a disk of any type is rapidly approaching zero. Why carry around extra equipment that you don’t really need all the time? Apple was the first popular computer maker to ditch a disk drive (in much the same way the company omitted the still-popular 3 1/2-inch drive from the first iMac, favoring a CD-ROM drive). Its line of MacBook Air laptops, which come in either an 11-inch version (starting at $999) or a 13-inch one (starting at $1,300), contain an internal, solid-state drive for storage and a couple of USB ports that can be used with flash (or thumb) drives if necessary. Other computer makers have followed suit. A new line of “ultrabooks” from various brands define themselves in a couple of ways: they are extremely thin, they don’t weigh as much as other laptops and they can run four to six hours between charges. Models include the U300S from Lenovo ($999), Asus’s UX21A (price not yet announced) and Samsung’s Series 5 Ultrabook ($800). Like the MacBook Air, these devices realize these goals by doing away with a disk drive — it adds bulk, it adds weight and spinning a mirrored circle around and around at high speed consumes a lot of power. Lose the drive, and you gain a lot more in portability and usability. So no more black boxes stacked in the living room if you want to listen to music. No more black boxes stacked near the TV if you want to watch a movie. No more bulky laptops with increasingly unnecessary components. Perhaps in my children’s lifetime, all these products will be reduced to their most elemental forms: a simple glass display to see things, with some small speakers to hear things. The future of media and tech devices is not how many things can be packed into a given size, but how much can be left out.

201205,Small Cameras That Can Switch Focus or Ride a Bike,"POINT-AND-SHOOT cameras are being assaulted on all fronts. Smartphones are threatening to make pocket-size cameras unnecessary by offering passable results on a device many people are already carrying around. Meanwhile, photographers who want better performance are likely to be tempted by mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras, which are shrinking to nearly pocket size while offering features like those found on professional-level, single-lens reflex cameras. But there is still life in the idea of a consumer-level camera that fits in a pocket and does not require much special knowledge to master. You can find some interesting and unusual cameras that will do things that a smartphone definitely will not do. THE LYTRO The most unusual piece of photographic equipment to hit the market in quite some time, the Lytro ($399 or $499, depending on the amount of memory and the color) is a strange-looking machine that takes photos in which objects can be brought into or out of focus after the photo is taken. When an image from the Lytro is viewed on a computer screen, a user can click on the foreground and pop it into focus, causing the background to blur. Click on the background, and the focus shifts, blurring the image in the foreground. It is quite a trick. The Lytro itself looks more like a kaleidoscope than a camera. It is a four-and-a-half-inch long rectangle with a touch screen on one end and a lens on the other. The only controls are a power button, a shutter release and a slider for the camera’s zoom. Shooting with it feels very different from using a standard point-and-shoot. The types of photos that work best on the Lytro are those with something of interest very close to the camera and something else of interest in the distant background. The results can be striking, but capturing images that take advantage of this effect takes some practice. The company is also working on a perspective-shift feature, which will allow a photographer to adjust the angle of the picture after the fact. The camera is somewhat awkward to use, largely because the touch screen is small and does not have very good resolution (a drawback that does not affect the photos). It is also harder than one might imagine to compose images that maximize its abilities. And it seems strange to use the Lytro for images that do not take advantage of its unique charms. The accompanying software, which is necessary for importing and processing the Lytro’s photos, is available for only Mac computers. For some people, the novelty of the Lytro as a technology will overcome its quirks as a product, but others will probably see it as gimmicky. One thing is certain, though: it is different. DURABLE POINT-AND-SHOOTS The camera industry has responded to smartphones by trying to make their point-and-shoot cameras look and feel like the devices threatening to supplant them. Many point-and-shoot cameras are now largely featureless black rectangles with a screen filling most of one side. Increasingly, camera companies are also adding wireless capabilities. Polaroid makes a camera that uses Android’s operating system for smartphones and does everything but make phone calls. At the same time, camera companies are also selling models that are very different from phones. These armored cameras are waterproof, can withstand cold weather and are meant to withstand falls of over six feet. These can be a bulky by pocket-camera standards and, in some cases, kind of ugly. But the Olympus Tough TG-820 iHS provides performance and price ($299) akin to a standard point-and-shoot. For those set on the sleek smartphone look, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX200V is the closest fit. It has more megapixels and offers some features that the Olympus does not, and the cost ($499) reflects that. With both cameras, photographs taken in bright light look good, but image quality suffers quickly as things get dim. Both cameras also shoot video in full HD. GOPRO For a specific kind of photographer, the durable camera that makes the most sense will be the GoPro, a tiny camera intended to be mounted on a bicycle, surfboard or helmet. The latest version, the GoPro HD Hero2 ($299) is a box with just two buttons. It fits into a clear, waterproof shell that also protects it from impact. The camera’s fixed wide-angle lens has an extremely high depth of field, eliminating any options regarding zoom or focus. In fact, the camera does not even have a viewfinder. The only decision to make is when to press the shutter. Well, not quite. The main potential for creativity with the GoPro is where to mount the camera. The Hero2 comes in three basic kits, for surfing, motor sports and outdoor sports, which could be snowboarding, bicycling or other activities. The difference between the kits are the various straps, suction cups and other ways to affix the camera to various objects that will then presumably travel at high speeds. The GoPro is probably best suited for video, although it also takes still photographs, either in short bursts or periodically over longer periods of time to create time lapse projects. Its lens distorts objects that are close, in an effect that will be familiar to anyone who has watched video of action sports. It is probably best to stay away from portraits with this one. Pictures taken in daylight look great, but turn grainy as the light gets lower. GoPro also makes several accessories that snap onto the back of the camera, called BacPacs. One offers an extra battery, while another attaches a screen so users can see what they are shooting. In June the company plans to release a Wi-Fi BacPac and mobile app, which will allow users to control the shutter via a remote control and transmit photographs and video directly from the camera to a phone over a wireless network.

201205,Up-to-Date Tricks For Aging Wheels,"CARS on American highways are getting older. The average vehicle is now nearly 11 years old, up from about nine years in 2001, according to the R. L. Polk automotive research company. That means many drivers in the ''dads and grads'' cohort are probably candidates for a technology upgrade. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for gift givers, as varied as high-tech collision warning systems and phone-related devices intended to prevent driver distraction. CELLPHONE CONTROL A recent Consumer Reports survey of drivers ages 16 to 21 found that while about 80 percent of respondents agreed that texting while driving was dangerous, roughly 30 percent conceded that they had done it. Although a variety of sophisticated solutions have been developed to prevent people from calling and texting while driving, most are easy to defeat or are overly restrictive. The Scosche Cellcontrol is an exception. It starts with a $129.95 matchbox-size device that plugs into the OBD-II diagnostics port found under the dashboard of cars made after 1996. In conjunction with an app downloaded to the user's Android or BlackBerry phone, it senses when the car is moving and, via Bluetooth, automatically locks out certain functions, including texting, e-mail and Web browsing. It recognizes when a car is parked and will allow phone calls when a hands-free device is connected. It does not work with iPhones. If your young driver tries to circumvent it by unplugging the dongle, Cellcontrol will alert you that the system has been disabled. Even rebooting a BlackBerry, for example, to disable the connection will not work. The phone will not restart unless the owner also restores the Bluetooth settings. Unlike some other cellular lockout solutions, it will not block other phones in the car. So a passenger could still place a call. It also will not inadvertently block calls from, for example, a bus or train, because it works only in conjunction with the Cellcontrol device. GPS TRACKING The trouble with most tracking gadgets is that they rely on battery power, which means you have to remember to charge them and put them back in the car. PocketFinder Vehicle can be installed under the hood, attached to the car battery and forgotten. Using a Web browser, owners can see the car's location, speed, and travel history on the PocketFinder service. The software allows parents to set travel boundaries and speed limits for young drivers. If they are exceeded, a text or e-mail will be sent to the parents. The initial cost is $189.95, which includes two months of service. The monthly fee is then $12.95. RADAR AND RED LIGHTS Cobra Electronics has updated its Cobra iRadar model, now the $129.95 iRAD 200. It is a low-profile dashboard detector of radar and laser traps. (Make sure that such devices are legal in your state.) Using a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone and a free iRadar app (for Android and iPhone models), it also alerts drivers to red light cameras. Fellow Cobra users can report police actions, accidents and new photo enforcement spots. The iRadar can also be set to automatically report laser alerts and share them with other iRadar owners. With a similar set of social networking features, Escort's Live adapter allows Escort owners to upgrade their detectors. The $99.95 Bluetooth device replaces the standard power cord on compatible models and sends information to a companion iPhone or Android smartphone app. Laser and Ka band alerts can be passed along automatically and anonymously to other Live community members via the smartphone app. It will even map where and when a hit was registered and deliver color-coded graphical notes and audible alerts. The price includes a one-year subscription. It is $39.95 annually thereafter. NAVIGATION In spite of the many navigation apps for smartphones, portable navigation devices are not obsolete -- yet. TomTom has added features that the socially conscious will appreciate. The reasonably priced $249.95 TomTom Go Live 1535M, for example, includes live traffic reports updated every two minutes. The service has the added benefit of gathering speed and location data in real time from other TomTom owners so that it can alert you to new congestion ahead and reroute you around it. New to this model is a suite of travel related apps, including Yelp and TripAdvisor for restaurant reviews and local recommendations. Updated fuel prices and weather information are also available. After the first year, Live services can be continued for $59.95 a year. COLLISION AND LANE MONITORS The latest technologically equipped vehicles offer advanced safety features, like collision and lane departure warnings. Now an ingenious app can add these functions to any car by using a smartphone with a camera. Called iOnRoad Augmented Driving Pro, the $4.99 program uses a phone's video camera stream, GPS feature, accelerometer and gyroscope to monitor the car's position on the road. A car cradle mount, which typically costs $20 to $30, is required for the phone. A power adapter cable is recommended to keep it charged. The main benefit of the app is its ability to measure a car's distance from vehicles ahead. The stopping distance is displayed on a live video feed and is measured in seconds (or feet if you choose), progressing from green to yellow (warning) to red when you get too close. Drift too close to a line, and it will flash a lane departure warning up on the phone's display. At its best, iOnRoad can promote better driving habits and prevent you from becoming an anxious tailgater. However, the alerts could make inexperienced drivers jumpy. It erroneously warned me, for example, that I was drifting out of my lane on several curves. It also failed to pick out a motorcycle ahead of me at night. TABLET HOLDERS Do not neglect passengers in the back seat. For them, entertainment is no longer about DVD players. It is all about iPads and tablets. A number of holders, cradles and brackets are made for specific models. A better option is the adjustable Satechi Cup Holder Mount. Its base expands to snugly fit various cup holder sizes, while its clamps adjust to hold 7- to 10-inch tablets in place. Two adjustable pivots can put the tablet in variety of positions, and the package includes a second smaller bracket for smartphones. It is a handy car accessory for just $29.99. Just remember to keep it in the back seat. OPTIONS: PocketFinder Vehicle, left. Cellcontrol restricts texting.; DEVICES: An iPhone rest, left. A radar detector.

201205,"Daddy, What Were Compact Discs?","ONE day, when my children are a little older, I will gather them close and I will tell them about how I lived through the Great Format Wars. I will recount to them a seemingly endless cycle of battles. From LP to cassette to minidisk (oh wait -- not to minidisk) to CD. From Betamax to VHS to DVD to HD-DVD to Blu-ray. From punchcards to magnetic tape to floppy disks to zip drives to DVD-ROMs. Some were dirty little skirmishes, like the Eight-Track Incursion of the late 1960s. But, oh, there are epic tales to be told as well: How my children's hearts will leap and dive (assuming they are not the kind to be bored to distraction by what Dad is droning on about) as they hear about VHS and Betamax, each bringing the other ever closer to oblivion, and how only one of them left the battlefield -- only to fall victim to a far nimbler opponent, DVD, which was waiting in the wings. And my children will hear of this and be amazed (see assumption above), for they know nothing of this kind of conflict. They will grow up in a world where physical storage of information is as outdated as rotary-dial telephones and mimeograph machines are now. Indeed, they already live in that world, even if vestiges of the old remain (turntables, for example). We older people can enjoy this new world as well, what with streaming music and video services, cloud-based storage options and social networks that easily absorb our photos and ephemera. We may be hardened by battles past, but our future is digital, wireless, ubiquitous and, we hope, pacific. Here's what it looks like. Music It was not that long ago that a home-stereo system was a black-and-brown tower of components: an amplifier, a receiver, a cassette deck, a CD player, a phonograph, perhaps an equalizer. All that can be cast aside. Our music is now stored digitally on a computer, or sent over the Internet from a streaming service like Spotify or Pandora. To hear it in the home, all that's required is a speaker to receive the necessary data. One of the simplest ways to do this is with a wireless speaker that uses Bluetooth wireless technology to connect to a smartphone or computer. The two big players in this area are Bose, with its SoundLink speaker ($300), and Jawbone, with its Jambox ($200) and Big Jambox ($300) speakers. The products vary in size and shape and have different secondary features, but their primary function is the same: to take the music that is on a computer or phone and, wirelessly, play it in a room. All three models are powered by a rechargeable battery (the Bose lasts eight hours on a charge; the Big Jambox lasts 15), so you can move them in and out of the house. Because many people store music on their phones or use it to pull in music from a streaming site, the smartphone becomes both the source and the remote control for the speaker. If a listener wants a more sophisticated package, there is also Sonos, which makes small ($300) and large ($400) indoor speakers that work on a proprietary network. When multiple speakers are set up around a house, music can be sent to all of them simultaneously, or different tracks can be sent to different rooms. Controlling the speakers can be done from a computer or via a smartphone app that works with your existing music library as well as Internet-based services. TV and Movies The VCR gave way to the DVD player, which then begot the Blu-ray DVD player, but the next device we use to watch movies will not have any disc or cartridge at all. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant Video are able to send shows and movies to televisions directly, and online stores like Apple's iTunes Store can allow users to download videos to their devices for offline viewing. To get this content onto a television, you need either a new TV -- which will probably have the ability to get on a Wi-Fi network, so it can access the Internet and reach streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu directly -- or an accessory that allows your current television to do the same thing. If the latter is the case, then you may want to consider a Roku box (starting at $50) or an Apple TV ($99). Both will allow you to get online and stream content. Roku has deals with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Plus. Apple's box will connect you to Netflix and will also gain you access to its iTunes store. If you're a user of other Apple products, Apple TV will let you view your pictures in iPhoto on your television; it can also work with iPhones and iPads, so your TV can ''mirror'' what's being shown on the tablet's screen. If you're playing a game on the iPad, the tablet can become the controller while your TV can become the larger display. Another way to view movies on demand is through gaming consoles. Microsoft's Xbox (starting at $200) has its own online-video service, and in some areas, can even pull in a limited number of cable channels, supplanting not only a DVD player, but a cable box as well. Sony's PlayStation 3 ($250) and Nintendo's Wii ($150) gaming consoles also have the ability to pull in streaming video from popular services. Computing Early computer users may remember that the storage medium of choice in the early 1980s was a cassette of magnetic tape. This then gave way to the 5 1/4-inch floppy, which in turn evolved into the 3 1/2-inch floppy (this time protected by a hard plastic case), only to be overtaken by the CD-ROM, which morphed into the DVD. But the latest portable computers forgo any removable storage media whatsoever. In an era when documents can be stored on Google Docs, photos on Facebook and other files on cloud services like Dropbox, the need for a disk of any type is rapidly approaching zero. Why carry around extra equipment that you don't really need all the time? Apple was the first popular computer maker to ditch a disk drive (in much the same way the company omitted the still-popular 3 1/2-inch drive from the first iMac, favoring a CD-ROM drive). Its line of MacBook Air laptops, which come in either an 11-inch version (starting at $999) or a 13-inch one (starting at $1,300), contain an internal, solid-state drive for storage and a couple of USB ports that can be used with flash (or thumb) drives if necessary. Other computer makers have followed suit. A new line of ''ultrabooks'' from various brands define themselves in a couple of ways: they are extremely thin, they don't weigh as much as other laptops and they can run four to six hours between charges. Models include the U300S from Lenovo ($999), Asus's UX21A (price not yet announced) and Samsung's Series 5 Ultrabook ($800). Like the MacBook Air, these devices realize these goals by doing away with a disk drive -- it adds bulk, it adds weight and spinning a mirrored circle around and around at high speed consumes a lot of power. Lose the drive, and you gain a lot more in portability and usability. So no more black boxes stacked in the living room if you want to listen to music. No more black boxes stacked near the TV if you want to watch a movie. No more bulky laptops with increasingly unnecessary components. Perhaps in my children's lifetime, all these products will be reduced to their most elemental forms: a simple glass display to see things, with some small speakers to hear things. The future of media and tech devices is not how many things can be packed into a given size, but how much can be left out.

201205,How to Speak Smartphone,"BUYING a smartphone, whether for yourself or as a gift, is a harrowing process made all the more mystifying by the language the marketers use. Every year they add new lingo and ever trickier claims -- all networks can't be the fastest, can they? Here is a glossary to help decipher what the ads and sales representatives are talking about. Some of the terms are very familiar, others arcane. 3G, 4G, WIMAX, HSPA+ These may be the most confusing terms because there is a lot of marketing mystery around them. The G stands for generation. The higher the number next to the G, the newer, and presumably faster, is the network the device is using. (To make things even more confusing, when Apple calls a product 4G, that means it is the fourth generation of that device, but not necessarily that it works on a 4G network, although sometimes it does.) Not all 4G is created equal. Different carriers use different kinds of 4G. If you are looking for speed (and who isn't?), the technologies, rated from fastest to slowest, are LTE, WiMax and HSPA+. After that come EVDO and EDGE, which are 3G. RootMetrics, a company that measures mobile network performance, tested in 42 markets and found that the fastest provider over all was Verizon (it has the most LTE), followed by AT&T, then T-Mobile and Sprint. But there are big caveats. One is, not every city has 4G from every carrier. Another is that you need a phone that receives the 4G network, and not all do. But most of all, the speed of a network doesn't matter if you can't get a signal. First, find which carrier has the strongest signal where you use your phone most. (There is a RootMetrics map you can check, and you can ask neighbors about their experiences.) Choose the fastest network with good reception in your price range. TIERED PLAN Carriers talk about ''tiers of service,'' which are packages with varying amounts of minutes, instant messages and data. The more time and data you buy, the more you pay. Many people overpay. With unlimited plans disappearing, many people buy a top tier for peace of mind -- that way, they know they will not run over and incur expensive penalties. But paying for minutes and data that aren't used may be more expensive than the occasional penalty. The trick is to buy only what you use, with a minimal cushion, which requires an accurate accounting of what you use. A Web site called BillShrink analyzes a current bill and makes a recommendation on what plan to buy. CDMA VS. GSM These are different wireless standards: think of them as being like AM and FM on radios. Of the large carriers, Verizon and Sprint (and brands using Sprint's network, like Virgin and Boost) are on CDMA. AT&T and T-Mobile (and its resellers) are on GSM. This matters mostly to international travelers: GSM is the standard in most of the world, so a GSM phone may be used in more places overseas. Another difference, less important to most people, is that a GSM phone keeps its identity and data, like contact lists, on a removable SIM card, which makes it easy to switch to a new phone. CDMA phones hold the phone's identity on the network, so the information may have to be sent over the network to a new phone, which is a bit more complex. WI-FI This provides the ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network using a phone. Why would you want to? There is no charge for data transmitted by Wi-Fi. As data limits become smaller (and data charges rise), that's a very good thing. If downloading two HD movies might eat up your monthly data limit, you could load them over Wi-Fi and leave the limit intact. APPS Apps is short for applications, another word for software or simple computer programs. Apps add functions to a phone, like maps that give audible directions, a stock ticker or a game like Angry Birds. Even for those phones with the fewest number of apps, thousands will be available. OS OS stands for operating system, the underlying software that runs the phone. The OS you get determines, among other things, the features of the phone and which apps it will run. According to market analysis by comScore, Google has the most popular OS in the United States (Android) with a 51 percent market share, followed by Apple (iOS) with 31 percent, Research in Motion (BlackBerry) with 12 percent and Microsoft (Windows) with 4 percent. The picture is a bit different when you look at customer satisfaction, as J. D. Power & Associates does. In its survey, Apple iOS was the clear favorite, followed by Windows and Android at near parity, then BlackBerry. Apple iOS has the greatest number of apps available. Often cited for its ease of use, it works easily across Apple products, and nearly does so with Windows computers as well. Android is almost as easy to use as iOS, but because there are many different versions, it doesn't work the same way with every Android phone. That means that not all phones can run all Android apps. If you want a specific app, check to see if it works on a prospective phone before you buy. Another difference from Apple is that with Android, extra software might be needed to connect a phone to a computer for sharing a contacts list or music. The Windows OS has come a long way, with engaging ''live tiles'': animated square icons that show updates, like the number of messages waiting, or the latest posts from social networks. A nice feature is that messages are threaded -- strung together for continuity -- even when they come from different sources. So a conversation begun on Facebook can continue by text and appear in one string. The BlackBerry still has the security features that make it beloved of corporate I.T. departments, but it has fallen from the top of the heap in consumer popularity. It has two primary features that help distinguish it from other phones. One is that most BlackBerrys still have physical keyboards, as opposed to touch screens. The other is BlackBerry Messenger, an app that allows free instant chatting between BlackBerrys anywhere in the world. BBM, as it's known, also allows the sending of pictures, videos and voice notes.

201205,"FEATURE-S.Africans live for the now, ignore calls to save","JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Reuters) - Like many South Africans, Nkululeko Makhaya has only the most basic financial strategy for his future: a pension contribution deducted from his salary and 100 rand ($11.90) put aside each month towards family funeral cover. The 35-year-old admits this is woefully inadequate, but with only a modest salary and obligations to both his immediate and extended family, there is barely enough each month to see him through to the next paycheck, let alone save. Cue the future: what happens in 30 years when he is still very much alive but retired, and inflation has eaten into his pension? ""I'll get by somehow. Hopefully my children will have good jobs and take care of my wife and me in return for the good education I'm paying for now,"" said Makhaya, a salesman for a Johannesburg cleaning products firm. ""I might not even live to retirement, in which case the funeral policy will come in handy."" In fact, Makhaya is setting aside more than most people in South Africa, where the majority of households are forced - or choose - to spend most of their income, and just keep their fingers crossed about the proverbial rainy day. The weak savings culture is a big headache for the government because it hampers speedy economic growth. With less cash sloshing around its banking system, South Africa cannot finance the infrastructure such as roads, ports and broadband Internet needed to move its economy up a gear. Tellingly, it fares poorly on both growth and savings when compared to peers in the BRICS bloc of developing countries. This year, South African GDP is forecast to grow at a rate below 3 percent, against 8 percent for China and 7 percent in India. And its savings rate of just 16 percent of GDP compares with 53 percent for China, 34 percent in India and 20 percent for Russia. Alarmingly, it appears to be getting worse. ""A strong savings culture is almost a prerequisite for sustainable economic development and South Africa has in the last 10 years or so gone backwards very fast,"" said Peter Dempsey, deputy CEO of the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa, a trade group for firms that provide savings products. SAVING NOTHING ""Households basically save zero percent in aggregate, meaning at a national level household income equals household expenses. If you go back 10 to 15 years ago it was probably sitting at 6 to 7 percent,"" Dempsey told Reuters. Net household savings, mainly in the form of retirement funds, long-term insurance, unit trusts and bank deposits, have been in negative territory since 2005, the Treasury says. In contrast, household debt as a ratio of disposable income remains unsustainably high at 75 percent. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his predecessor, Trevor Manuel, both begged South Africa's 50 million people to save more, but their entreaties were trumped by the power of bling - those with disposable income would rather spend it on the latest flat-screen TV or smartphone than put it away for the future. This partly reflects South Africa's racially divided apartheid past in which millions of marginalised blacks had no access to credit and other financial services. They are now grabbing the chance to acquire assets at the expense of saving. ""It's not necessarily a bad thing,"" said Colen Garrow, an economist at Meganomics. ""Low savings levels should be seen in the context of assets such as homes and motor vehicles that new consumers purchased after the first democratic elections in 1994. Before that, most South Africans were simply not able to buy such assets. ""But I can see why Pravin Gordhan is worried. If you can't finance investment out of your savings - which we can't - then you're going to have to go out of South Africa and borrow on international capital markets. That's exactly what's happening."" Under apartheid, black South Africans with little access to traditional banking came up with informal savings schemes like ""stokvels"", in which a small group of around a dozen people - usually women - gather once a month and pool their savings. Each chips in a small fixed sum, usually between 100 and 1,000 rand, and a different member each month gets to take home the whole pot. Peer pressure ensures all members contribute, providing a convenient way for women in poor townships to save up for big purchases like furniture. An estimated 40 billion rand ($4.8 billion) is invested in stokvels, a recent study shows, but the money rarely finds its way it into the formal financial system, denying the economy access to funds that could help fund crucial investment. Banks and investment companies are trying to get access to that money. Sluggish growth represents a major political threat for the ruling African National Congress, the former liberation movement which turned 100 this year but is still learning how to run a sophisticated emerging market economy. The government says growth needs to hit 7 percent to make any sort of a dent in unemployment that, at 25 percent, is crushing the dream of the ""Rainbow Nation"" by perpetuating the racial inequalities of apartheid and fuelling one of the world's highest rates of violent crime. Angry township protests by young men with little to lose are already a daily occurrence, and, after uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa in the last 18 months, top ANC officials admit they sitting on a powderkeg. SPEND, DON'T LEND However, with bank charges stubbornly high despite government pressure to get them down, and interest rates at 30-year lows since the end of 2010, there is very little incentive for most South Africans to save. Yields on 3-year domestic debt are now at 6.5 percent, close to historic lows and compared with 8 percent five years ago. Meanwhile, banks, credit card firms and shops make it all too easy to borrow, despite a law introduced in 2006 to try to enforce responsible lending. Which is why Nkululeko Makhaya's neighbour in the lower-middle-income Johannesburg suburb of Bramley drives the latest BMW model. And why 23-year-old receptionist Sindi Mpheko can only afford to rent a small backyard room in the rundown township of Alexandra but always turns up for her job in the Sandton financial district kitted out in the latest trendy wear. ""I'm just taking care of me for now, no responsibilities. I want to have fun while I can and worry about the future later, in my late twenties,"" Mpheko says, a touch defensively. She is among the 90 percent of South Africans the Treasury says are not tucking away enough savings and investment to enable them to retain the same living standard on retirement. Even higher income earners such as chartered accountant Carol Khozwayo would rather invest in ""visible"" assets such as property than put money in the stock market or government bonds. Khozwayo and her husband have re-mortaged their house in the upmarket Fourways suburb of northern Johannesburg to purchase two smaller town houses they rent out to finance the repayments. The 2007 collapse of asset management firm Fidentia in a fraud scandal in which millions of rand - including pensions for miners' widows - went missing, has also given the savings industry a bad name. ""I would rather see physical evidence of my investment and be assured that my children's future is fairly secure,"" Khozwayo said. ""Look what happened to Fidentia.""

201205,"Research in Motion, Struggling, Ponders a Dim Future","After rejecting the idea of a sale for months, Research in Motion acknowledged on Tuesday that it was considering ""strategic business model alternatives"" - or in banker's speak, RIM, which makes the BlackBerry, said it was pondering a potential deal for all or parts of the company. But did it wait too long? A year ago, RIM, a Canadian company, became the subject of takeover rumors, after Google's $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility. Then, analysts believed that RIM would draw interest from Microsoft, Amazon.com or any number of Chinese phone manufacturers who could afford what would have been a pricey deal. The company's executives rebuffed the idea, arguing that RIM was on the verge of a turnaround. New phones were coming that combined touch-screens with BlackBerry's e-mail and security features. And the PlayBook, with an industrial-strength operating system, could stand toe to toe with the iPad. But RIM's prospects have withered since. In March, the company disclosed that its quarterly sales had plunged 20 percent from the previous quarter, as customers migrated to iPhones and Android devices. The company warned on Tuesday that it expected another loss. The weakness is reflected in the stock's sharp decline. RIM's market value is just $5.4 billion, down roughly 76 percent from a year ago. Its share price fell slightly on Thursday, to $10.33. ""Buying this stock is like going to the casino,"" analysts at National Bank Financial wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Now, executives appear to be reluctantly admitting they need to make a change. On Tuesday, the company said that it is conducting a strategic review. As part of its effort, RIM tapped JPMorgan Chase and RBC Capital Markets to help assess its potential options. Those efforts may not lead to a sale, but instead partnerships with other companies or the licensing of BlackBerry software. Earlier this year, RIM's chief executive, Thorsten Heins, disavowed any need to consider ""drastic change."" Ehud Gelblum, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note - entitled ""No Happy Ending in Sight"" - on Wednesday that he did not believe RIM was seeking to sell itself as a whole, but may consider outsourcing its network operating center or selling off parts. That may be the best option. Earlier this year, the sales prospects for RIM did not look promising. A few analysts believed that RIM did not have ""much to offer"" a potential buyer. The company's prospects may have deteriorated in the intervening months. Some analysts indicate that RIM may only be worth the total value of its patents and its cash, roughly $1.8 billion. It is unclear what the patents may fetch, though analysts at Jefferies estimated last fall that the intellectual property could bring $1 billion to $2.5 billion. Should RIM put itself on the auction block, it may find the universe of potential buyers remains fairly small. Microsoft, long considered a possible suitor, has been focused on its new Windows operating system and its tie-up with Nokia. Amazon.com has cast its lot with a version of Google's Android. And buyers in China and India may face complaints from important BlackBerry customers like the United States and Canadian governments. And patience isn't necessarily a virtue in deal-making. Take Yahoo, which Microsoft offered to buy for nearly $45 billion in 2008. The talks quickly cratered, and a deal never panned out. Yahoo has since run through three chief executives and cast about for a new business model. It has agreed to sell about half of its stake in the Alibaba Group of China, a move that will generate cash that can be paid out to investors. And it has revamped its board. But it is unclear whether such efforts will make up for Yahoo's 58 percent drop in value since Microsoft's takeover attempt. Then there is Palm Inc., which is often compared with RIM at this stage. Having failed to gain traction with a series of devices built on its own smartphone operating system, the company began a sales process several years ago, drawing in five bids. One suitor, Hewlett-Packard, was pressured into raising its offer by 20 percent, and ultimately paid $1.2 billion to win the bidding. The deal represented a 23 percent premium to the smartphone maker's closing price from the day before the offer was announced in 2010. Yet by that point, Palm's stock price had dropped 50 percent over the previous 12 months. Still, there's some hope left for RIM. Motorola Mobility had largely been left for dead by August 2011, trailing Samsung and H.T.C. in the race for Android device dominance. Then Android's creator, Google itself, arrived with a bid carrying a whopping 63 percent premium, spurred by the valuable patents that Motorola held. * Investor Says Momentum Builds for Breakup of Research in Motion * Callvine Raises $4 Million for Group Calling The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120601e85v0002u ",NYT Blogs,31 May 2012,855 words,research motion struggling ponders dim future,rejecting idea sale month research motion acknowledged tuesday considering strategic business model alternative banker speak rim make blackberry said pondering potential part company wait long year ago canadian became subject takeover rumor google billion motorola mobility analyst believed interest microsoft amazoncom number chinese phone manufacturer afford pricey executive rebuffed arguing verge turnaround new coming combined touchscreen email security feature playbook industrialstrength operating system stand toe ipad prospect withered since march disclosed quarterly plunged percent previous quarter customer migrated iphones android device warned tuesday expected another loss weakness reflected stock sharp market value roughly price fell slightly thursday buying like casino bank financial wrote note wednesday appear reluctantly admitting need change tuesday conducting review effort tapped jpmorgan chase rbc capital help ass may instead partnership licensing software earlier chief thorsten heins disavowed drastic ehud gelblum morgan stanley wrote entitled happy ending sight wednesday seeking sell whole outsourcing network center selling best promising believed much offer buyer deteriorated intervening worth patent cash unclear fetch though jefferies estimated last intellectual property put auction block find universe remains fairly small microsoft considered suitor focused window tieup nokia amazoncom version china india face complaint important united canadian government patience isnt necessarily virtue dealmaking yahoo microsoft offered nearly quickly cratered never panned since three agreed half alibaba group generate paid investor revamped board whether since microsofts palm inc compared stage failed traction series built smartphone began several drawing five one hewlettpackard pressured raising ultimately win bidding represented premium smartphone day announced yet dropped there hope left motorola largely dead august trailing samsung htc race dominance creator arrived carrying whopping spurred valuable motorola held momentum breakup callvine calling york time document nytbevu
201205,Microsoft signals work on Windows 8 nearly complete with release of final test version of OS,"REDMOND, Wash. (AP) - Microsoft is nearly done with a much-anticipated overhaul of its Windows operating system. The software maker signaled the makeover is nearly complete with Thursday's release of the final test version of Windows 8. Windows 8 is considered to be the biggest change in decades to Microsoft's widely used operating system. The software displays applications in a mosaic of tiles and has been designed so it can run desktop, laptop and tablet computers. PC sales have slowed in the U.S. as consumers delay replacements and instead buy mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. The versatility of Windows 8 is expected to spawn a new generation of computers that are part laptop, part tablet. The latest test version of Windows 8 is available in 14 languages and includes several improvements from a less-refined version released three months ago. The upgrades include more ways to connect to other Microsoft services, more security controls and more touch-screen features. Microsoft Corp. hasn't announced when Windows 8 will go on sale yet. Most industry analysts expect the software will be available in September or October. With Windows 8 looming, more prospective computer buyers may delay their purchases until the new operating system is available. Microsoft is trying to discourage procrastination with a special promotion that begins Saturday in the U.S., Canada and more than 120 other markets. The program allows buyers of computer running on Windows 7 to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, when it's available, for $14.99. Microsoft hasn't announced other prices. -------- Online: Windows 8 download: http://preview.windows.com 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Samsung Launches Galaxy S3 in India,"NEW DELHI – South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., which launched the latest version of its Galaxy S series in India Thursday, said it aims to grab a 60% share of the country's smartphone market in 2012. Last year, Samsung held about 46.5% of the Indian smartphone market. The country is one of the top three strategic markets in the world for Samsung, after the U.S. and Europe, the company's vice president of sales and marketing, H.C. Ryu, said in a statement. Samsung has launched its Galaxy S3 in India at 43,180 rupees ($768). The new phone offers face-recognition technology and improved voice-activated controls, as well as a more powerful processor that lets users watch video and write emails simultaneously. Samsung has become the top smartphone vendor in India, as Apple Inc. isn't aggressively pushing its iPhones in the country and Nokia Corp.'s share is fast shrinking. Last September, Samsung predicted that revenue from India may double to $10 billion in three years, spurred by sales of mobile devices and flat-panel televisions. Sales of smartphones in India are tipped to rise to between 18 million and 20 million units this year from about nine million last year, according to research firm GfK Nielsen. India's mobile handset market is expected to grow 19% to 160 million units. Samsung is targeting the fastest-expanding market for wireless services in India, which is driven by growth of Internet usage among the country's 1.2 billion people.

201205,"RIM's Next Move? Stay, Share or Sell","Research In Motion Ltd.'s rookie chief executive is now racing the clock to stem its quickly weakening smartphone business—or come up with options to save the BlackBerry maker. With each passing quarter, RIM's financial situation is eroding and so too are its workable alternatives. Analysts and industry executives say RIM, by not considering more radical options earlier like selling the company, has now forced itself into a make-or-break blitz to roll out its next smartphone and operating system this year. ""There are a bunch of people [within RIM] that still don't understand how dire the situation is,"" a person close to the company said. Chief Executive Thorsten Heins warned Tuesday that RIM won't make a profit this quarter, and named the bankers that have been working with the company for several months on a turnaround strategy—a move that many analysts interpreted as a signal RIM's financial woes have ratcheted up urgency in finding a buyer. But people familiar with the matter said RIM still isn't actively shopping itself outright, and is instead focused on seeing through the launch of BlackBerry 10, a new operating system that will power both its latest BlackBerry phone and its PlayBook tablet. If RIM is successful, that might make it a more valuable acquisition target. Last year, Microsoft Corp. and Nokia Corp. considered making a joint offer for the company, but those talks never proceeded past the initial stages, according to people familiar with the situation. Other outright buyers could include Asian handset makers like HTC Corp., or online retailer Amazon.com Inc., which has jumped into the tablet business. So far, these and other potential buyers, with the cash hoard and stomach for risk that would come with a RIM tie-up, haven't made a move. RIM's stock fell 7.8% Wednesday to $10.35 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, pushing its market capitalization under $6 billion from some $40 billion early last year. An acquisition also comes with significant execution risk. Several Canadian politicians have sent mixed signals about how Ottawa would view a foreign takeover offer. ""Nobody is serious about buying RIM right now,"" said the person close to the company. Microsoft and HTC declined to comment. Representatives at Nokia and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests. A RIM spokeswoman said that RIM employees ""understand the vital importance of launching BlackBerry 10 on time at a quality that exceeds the expectations of our users."" Short of an outright sale, RIM could try to cozy up to a handset maker and license its software or open up its valuable security network. Rival device makers HTC and Samsung Electronics Co. both had talks with RIM last year about licensing RIM's forthcoming operating system, according to people familiar with the situation. But Mr. Heins canceled these licensing talks after taking over, according to people familiar with the matter. It is unclear if he's restarted discussions amid RIM's worsening financial picture. RIM also owns a crop of patents which most analysts value at $2 billion to $2.5 billion. But a successful rollout of the phone is RIM's best-case scenario—and even that will be difficult as RIM needs to impress consumers in an increasingly crowded market. Apple Inc. is expected to release its next iPhone this year, while more powerful devices using Google Inc.'s Android software are appearing each month. And recently Nokia, armed with a relatively well-reviewed Microsoft operating system, is cutting prices for its low-end devices around the world. Nokia's move targets the same developing-world markets where RIM has recently performed relatively well. The few details RIM has shown off to application developers—including a new touch pad keyboard and an easy-to-use interface—have garnered positive reviews. But so far, RIM has given no specific timeline for that launch, and only the barest glimpse of what the new BlackBerry 10 phones may look like. ""Given the increased competition in the high end, and dramatic growth in low-end Android, we see little hope for a turnaround,"" BMO analyst Tim Long said in a note to clients. ""While the company is pinning its hopes on (the) BlackBerry 10 OS, we believe it is too little and too late."" RIM has a still-comfortable cash cushion, upward of $2 billion, which the company said it expects to increase in the current quarter. But if losses continue, that safety margin is also under threat. RIM will need to spend heavily to push out its new phone and market it widely later this year. In recent weeks, Mr. Heins has been focused on shaking up RIM's top management, amid a parade of senior-executive departures and a handful of new c-suite hires.He's also promised to cut costs, warning Tuesday of ""significant"" job losses in certain divisions, though assuring investors he would still be hiring to support the BlackBerry 10 launch. The company has decided it needs to cut at least 1,500 employees—RIM had 16,500 workers as of March—and may cut many more, according to people familiar with the matter. The RIM spokeswoman said the company isn't managing toward a specific head count. Anupreeta Das contributed to this article. Write to Will Connors at william.connors@wsj.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,Corporate News: HTC Phones Gain Clearance From U.S.,"TAIPEI-- HTC Corp. cleared a critical hurdle in a crucial market when all of its shipments to the U.S. -- including the latest EVO 4G LTE and One series smartphones -- passed customs review, fulfilling a precondition for imports set by a U.S. trade body, the company said Wednesday. ""The devices were released and will reach customers in the U.S. soon,"" an HTC official said. The Taiwan mobile-phone maker said it had worked around the design of the new phones to avoid the disputed technology that the International Trade Commission ruled to be in violation of a patent held by Apple Inc. Shares in HTC fell 1.9% to 424 New Taiwan dollars (US$14.31) in Taipei on Wednesday.' While analysts say that both the EVO 4G and One series smartphones are important for HTC in its quest to maintain, or gain, market share in the U.S., the Taiwan company continues to face an uphill battle against dominant rivals Apple Inc. of the U.S. and Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea. The HTC official said future shipments to the U.S. will continue to be inspected by customs due to an order issued by the ITC in December that took effect April 19, but declined to say whether the latest go-ahead issued by U.S. Customs implies that future inspections will require less time. The ITC order requires all HTC shipments to the U.S. after April 19 to be inspected and cleared by U.S. Customs before reaching customers. ""Future inspections will likely take less time, which is a relief,"" KGI Securities analyst Richard Ko said. ""But the fundamentals are still not optimistic, as competition from [Samsung's] Galaxy III and [Apple's] iPhone will continue to be tough."" HTC said last week that some shipments of EVO 4G phones were already cleared by U.S. Customs by May 22, but the HTC official on Wednesday declined to give a specific launch date for the EVO 4G phones in the U.S. The launch of this model was delayed from May 18 due to the customs review. But according to the website of Sprint, HTC's designated network carrier for EVO 4G phones in the U.S., the phones were delivered starting Thursday to customers who preordered the phone. HTC earlier said that the inspection could also disrupt future sales of its One series of smartphones, which were released in the U.S. last month before the customs inspection order took effect. As HTC's sales in the U.S. remain weak, the company has been turning to Asia and other emerging markets for growth. But some analysts have questioned the company's strategy, saying that it would be tough for HTC, which lacks the cachet of Apple or Samsung, to compete against Chinese handset makers, which offer smartphones at lower prices. Like HTC, Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. also produce smartphones with advanced features.

201205,IPhone moves down-market as Cricket prepares to sell it starting at $400; service $55/month,"NEW YORK (AP) - Leap Wireless International Inc., the parent of the Cricket cellphone service, on Thursday said it will be the first mainland U.S. phone company to sell recent iPhone models on a prepaid, no-contract basis. Starting June 22, Leap will sell the iPhone 4S starting at $500 and the iPhone 4 starting at $400. Service will cost $55 per month for unlimited calls, texting and data. Leap Wireless International Inc., which is based in San Diego, focuses on selling no-contract service to low-income households. Its own network is limited to certain cities. In other places, it uses Sprint Nextel Corp.'s network. The iPhone is compatible with only part of Leap's network, and the company is limiting sales to those areas, which include Houston and Austin, Texas; Portland, Ore.; Pittsburgh; Denver; and Salt Lake City. Leap said the arrangement will be available in areas covering about 70 percent of its 6.2 million subscribers. Leap is the sixth-largest cellphone company in the U.S., as measured by number of subscribers. Open Mobile, which serves Puerto Rico, became the first U.S. company to start selling the iPhone 4 and 4s on a no-contract, prepaid basis on May 18. When the original iPhone launched in 2007, buyers could chose to set it up directly on an AT&T prepaid plan, But that option disappeared with later models. It has been possible to use imported or hacked ""unlocked"" phones on prepaid plans as well. Leap's ""unlimited"" data service for the phone slows down once a customer user has racked up 2.3 gigabytes of usage since the start of a monthly billing cycle. That's a slightly lower limit than either Verizon or AT&T imposes under their ""unlimited"" plans. Apple sells the iPhone at an average wholesale price of $647. The bigger phone companies then subsidize it by hundreds of dollars to sell it for $99 or $199. They count on making their money back in service fees over the life of a two-year contract. Since Leap sells the phone without a contract, it's subsidizing the phone less. Larger carriers also sell the iPhone without a contract plan. But those phones cost more than iPhones bought through plans, and service costs the same as for phones used on a contract plan. Leap's plan is cheaper than what most iPhone customers pay. Since the iPhone is so expensive, it's not a given that it's a good deal for a phone company to sell it. In a presentation to investors, Leap said it has committed $900 million over three years to buying iPhones. That's just 10 percent of its projected spending on phones, it said, and it doesn't expect iPhone sales to affect its operating income this year. ""We wouldn't be doing it if we didn't think it was a money maker,"" said Leap CEO Doug Hutcheson, in an interview. But because of the high price of the phone, he doesn't expect that more than 10 percent of the company's customers will buy it. ""This is an important addition to our portfolio, but it isn't going to become our business,"" Hutcheson said. Leap sells smartphones running Google Inc.'s Android software for $100, and sometimes even less. Investors initially cheered the news, sending Leap shares up in premarket trading, but the stock closed unchanged at $5.77. The iPhone is hugely popular, but its price has kept it out of reach of many people who want it, across the world. When asked whether they could produce a cheaper model to satisfy demand, Apple executives have said that their first priority is making a good phone. Missing from Leap's iPhone lineup is the 3GS, an older model that's still sold by AT&T. It's cheaper than the newer models, but doesn't work with Leap's or Sprint's networks. Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc. and Sprint, the three biggest cellphone companies in the U.S., already sell the iPhone, as do a half-dozen smaller, regional phone companies. The biggest companies that don't carry it are T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications Inc. U.S. Cellular Corp., another regional carrier, said it turned down the chance to sell the phone because of its cost. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Prospects Dim for BlackBerry Maker --- Research In Motion Hires Two Advisers to Evaluate Options And Warns of Operating Loss; Shares Fall 7.1% After Hours,"Research In Motion Ltd. warned its business is deteriorating and will likely lose money for the second straight quarter, underscoring the uphill battle to turn around its flagging BlackBerry smartphone business. The dire outlook comes as RIM scrambles to cut costs ahead of the rollout of its next BlackBerry expected this year. RIM is depending on this phone and a new mobile operating system to rescue the business, yet it still hasn't provided a date for the debut. Analysts have been marking down their earnings estimate for the quarter for weeks, but most had still figured RIM would turn a small profit in the period. The company posted a $930 million profit in the year-earlier quarter, and it has maintained an annual profit since fiscal 2004. RIM also said Tuesday it had hired outside advisers to help its board to figure out how to salvage -- or possibly sell parts of -- its business. The company said it hired bankers at J.P. Morgan Securities and RBC Capital to assist in a previously announced strategic review of options. Representatives at RBC and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. The banks are helping executives ""evaluate the relative merits and feasibility of various financial strategies, including opportunities to leverage the BlackBerry platform through partnerships, licensing opportunities and strategic business model alternatives,"" said Chief Executive Thorsten Heins in a statement. RIM shares fell 7.1% to $10.43 in after-hours trading, pushing the Canadian company's market capitalization under $6 billion, down from more than $39 billion at the start of last year. Mr. Heins has said he isn't looking to sell the company but has also declined to specifically rule that option out. In Tuesday's statement, RIM didn't say whether it was now looking actively for a buyer. A RIM spokeswoman said the company still believed ""the best way to drive value for our stakeholders is to execute on our plan to turn the company around."" The company, which employed more than 16,500 as of March, said it was taking additional steps to rein in costs. On Tuesday, it didn't provide details, but said there would be ""significant"" job losses in some parts of its business. RIM also said it would still be hiring to support the rollout of its new phone, the BlackBerry 10. RIM said it was targeting $1 billion in cost savings by the end of its fiscal year. RIM has been buffeted by falling BlackBerry sales globally and crumbling market share in the lucrative North American smartphone market amid competition by Apple Inc.'s iPhones and devices run off of Google Inc.'s Android operating system. Over the past year, RIM has announced a series of profit warnings and -- more recently -- several quarters of slowing BlackBerry sales around the world. RIM first unveiled its strategic review in March shortly after Mr. Heins took the reins from long time co-chiefs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, who stepped down from management early in the year. Since then, Mr. Heins has presided over a wide-ranging restructuring of the company's top ranks. The company has announced the departure of a series of high-ranking RIM executives -- including in the past week its top lawyer and its head of global sales. But it has also brought on a handful of new executives in recent weeks. Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, said he still wasn't expecting RIM to sell itself this year. But meanwhile, investors may not see any move short of an outright sale as a radical enough move in the effort to bolster RIM's position. ""This isn't really a transition yet,"" Mr. Gillis said. ""This is really just a downward slide."" Investors sold off shares Tuesday after the news was announced, mostly spooked by the disclosure that the company now expects to report an operating loss in its fiscal first quarter ending June 2. RIM cited falling sales volumes and competitive pricing for the expected loss. Analysts have said the company may be forced to write down more inventory as unsold BlackBerrys and its poor-selling PlayBook tablet stack up in warehouses. Last year, RIM took a nearly half-billion-dollar write-down on unsold PlayBooks. In its last fiscal quarter, it wrote down $267 million in unsold BlackBerrys. Mr. Heins didn't give any cause for short-term optimism. ""Our financial performance will continue to be challenging for the next few quarters,"" he said in the statement. But RIM also said its cash holdings would increase in the quarter, from last period's $2.1 billion stockpile. That is still a healthy cushion, and with RIM essentially debt free, it could alleviate some worry that RIM risks burning through cash as it scrambles to unroll its next phone by year-end. --- Will Connors in Toronto and Anupreeta Das in New York contributed to this article.

201205,Tech Suits Endanger Innovation,"Casual observers would find little in common between the smartphones in their pockets and the funky backbeat of the Beastie Boys’ Car Thief. But these two creations will go down together in the annals of creativity as reminders of the flaws in our intellectual property laws. TufAmerica, which manages the rights to the catalog of the go-go band Trouble Funk, sued the Beastie Boys this month, saying they had illegally used samples from Trouble Funk’s classics “Drop the Bomb” and “Say What” in several tracks on their 1980s albums “Licensed to Ill” and “Paul’s Boutique.” To fans of 1980s hip-hop, the suit was a bitter reminder of how copyright law changed the music they loved. Back then, a new generation of artists rapped over elaborate musical mosaics made of brief samples from other songs. “Paul’s Boutique” included hundreds of samples from artists ranging from the Beatles to Afrika Bambaataa. A series of court decisions in the 1990s, though, made this kind of musical collage all but impossible, forcing artists to get permission for every snippet they used — a logistical and financial nightmare. Lawsuits flew against several rappers, and a form of cultural expression virtually disappeared. Hip-hop may have little to do with high tech. But its experience carries a stark warning for the future of technology. High-tech behemoths in a range of businesses like mobile computing and search and social networking have been suing one another to protect their intellectual property from what they see as the blatant copying and cloning by their rivals. Regardless of the legitimacy of their claims, the aggressive litigation could have a devastating effect on society as a whole, short-circuiting innovation. The battle raging over smartphone technology is the latest case in point. Since 2010, Apple and Microsoft have led a frenzy of patent and copyright litigation against the makers of smartphones running Google’s Android operating system, hoping courts around the world will force their rivals to pay license fees, remove features from their devices or even leave the market altogether. Apple and Microsoft have spent billions to acquire the patent portfolios of old technology companies to bolster their case. Though Google has mainly played defense, its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility and its thousands of patents have helped Android device makers go on the offensive. The confrontation could have a reasonable outcome — a détente in which the companies licensed each other’s technology on reasonable terms and coexisted in peaceful rivalry. But the smartphone wars could easily escalate, reducing competition in mobile computing and, like hip-hop mash-ups, knocking technologies out of the market for good. This would defeat the very purpose of intellectual property law. Patents on inventions, like copyrights on songs, are not granted to be fair to their creators. Their purpose is to encourage innovation, a broad social good, by granting creators a limited monopoly to profit from their creations. While companies like Apple may believe they are insufficiently compensated for their inventions, the evidence often suggests otherwise. The belief that stronger intellectual property protection inevitably leads to more innovation appears to be broadly wrong. Innovation is often tripped up by intellectual property rights. One study found that the number of new rose varieties registered by American nurseries fell after the passage of the Plant Patent Act of 1930, which allowed for the patenting of new rose hybrids. Another study concluded that copyrighting new gene sequences sharply reduced scientists’ subsequent experimentation with the decoded genes, even if they were later placed in the public domain. Surveys have found that the risk of patent litigation deters firms from pursuing innovations. It’s not that we don’t need to protect intellectual property at all. But the protections must take into account that innovation is often a cumulative process, with each step piggybacking on the ideas before it. Like “Paul’s Boutique,” the software that drives smartphones is composed of a vast array of ideas from multiple sources. Everybody infringes to some extent on everybody else. Overly strong intellectual property laws that stop creators from using earlier innovations could slow creation over all and become a barrier for new technologies to reach the market. One of Apple’s patents, for instance, appears to grant it ownership over any application based on a user’s location. Think of the Google map feature that pinpoints where you are. Or imagine an app showing nearby hospitals or the best deals in nearby pizzerias. If Apple enforced the patent aggressively, it could foreclose a vast array of innovation. To compound the problem, critics argue, the Patent and Trademark Office regularly issues patents on inventions that are obvious or not new. Sometimes the patents are written too broadly. Apple, for instance, has patents on the concept of moving objects around on a mobile device’s screen using multiple touches. Not the specific instructions; the concept. Broad patents can even capture applications that the patent holder never envisioned. Facebook did not succeed because it was the first social networking technology. It succeeded because of how it unfolded the social networking model among student communities. Still, two months before Facebook’s initial public offering, Yahoo sued it for patent infringement, arguing that “Facebook’s entire social network model, which allows users to create profiles for and connect with, among other things, persons and businesses, is based on Yahoo’s patented social networking technology.” Broad patents can hinder innovation by allowing dominant businesses to stop future inventions that would disrupt their business model. “Who has patents?” asked the Stanford economist Tim Bresnahan, an expert on technology policy. “It’s the guys who have been around for a while, not the guys who have done a lot of innovation lately.” Overly broad patents have given birth to an entire new industry of “patent trolls,” whose only business is to buy patents and sue for royalties. TufAmerica, for instance, has made a business out of buying the rights to old songs and suing artists who sample them without permission. Intellectual property rights could be improved to better serve their purpose of encouraging innovation. Carl Shapiro, an expert on information technology on President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, has suggested patent reforms, including making it easier to challenge patents after they are issued, culling the roster of overly broad or ambiguous claims, and allowing those accused of infringement to claim independent invention as a defense. Perhaps software should not be patentable at all. In rulings since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has determined that abstract concepts like mathematical formulas cannot be patented. It has struck down two software patents and ruled against patents on diagnostic techniques because they were based on laws of nature. And it has asked an appeals court to reconsider a decision on patents over advertising online. Yet for all the concern over excess, intellectual property protections seem only to grow stronger. In 1998, for instance, Congress extended copyright protection to 70 years after the death of the author, from 50. Notably, the legislation applied to works of art that had already been created and hence needed no further incentive to come into being. Software patents will never be banned, of course. Indeed, software patents exploded after an appeals court in 1998 upheld a patent on a method to pool the assets of mutual funds using a mathematical algorithm, establishing the patentability of a business method and the software to run it. And the America Invents Act of last year, a measure expected to curb some of the excesses of patent law, came up short, allowing only a small window of time for companies to challenge new patents and forcing companies that challenged a patent to waive the right to do so again in court.

201205,Tech Suits Endanger Innovation,"Casual observers would find little in common between the smartphones in their pockets and the funky backbeat of the Beastie Boys' Car Thief. But these two creations will go down together in the annals of creativity as reminders of the flaws in our intellectual property laws. TufAmerica, which manages the rights to the catalog of the go-go band Trouble Funk, sued the Beastie Boys this month, saying they had illegally used samples from Trouble Funk's classics ''Drop the Bomb'' and ''Say What'' in several tracks on their 1980s albums ''Licensed to Ill'' and ''Paul's Boutique.'' To fans of 1980s hip-hop, the suit was a bitter reminder of how copyright law changed the music they loved. Back then, a new generation of artists rapped over elaborate musical mosaics made of brief samples from other songs. ''Paul's Boutique'' included hundreds of samples from artists ranging from the Beatles to Afrika Bambaataa. A series of court decisions in the 1990s, though, made this kind of musical collage all but impossible, forcing artists to get permission for every snippet they used -- a logistical and financial nightmare. Lawsuits flew against several rappers, and a form of cultural expression virtually disappeared. Hip-hop may have little to do with high tech. But its experience carries a stark warning for the future of technology. High-tech behemoths in a range of businesses like mobile computing and search and social networking have been suing one another to protect their intellectual property from what they see as the blatant copying and cloning by their rivals. Regardless of the legitimacy of their claims, the aggressive litigation could have a devastating effect on society as a whole, short-circuiting innovation. The battle raging over smartphone technology is the latest case in point. Since 2010, Apple and Microsoft have led a frenzy of patent and copyright litigation against the makers of smartphones running Google's Android operating system, hoping courts around the world will force their rivals to pay license fees, remove features from their devices or even leave the market altogether. Apple and Microsoft have spent billions to acquire the patent portfolios of old technology companies to bolster their case. Though Google has mainly played defense, its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility and its thousands of patents have helped Android device makers go on the offensive. The confrontation could have a reasonable outcome -- a detente in which the companies licensed each other's technology on reasonable terms and coexisted in peaceful rivalry. But the smartphone wars could easily escalate, reducing competition in mobile computing and, like hip-hop mash-ups, knocking technologies out of the market for good. This would defeat the very purpose of intellectual property law. Patents on inventions, like copyrights on songs, are not granted to be fair to their creators. Their purpose is to encourage innovation, a broad social good, by granting creators a limited monopoly to profit from their creations. While companies like Apple may believe they are insufficiently compensated for their inventions, the evidence often suggests otherwise. The belief that stronger intellectual property protection inevitably leads to more innovation appears to be broadly wrong. Innovation is often tripped up by intellectual property rights. One study found that the number of new rose varieties registered by American nurseries fell after the passage of the Plant Patent Act of 1930, which allowed for the patenting of new rose hybrids. Another study concluded that copyrighting new gene sequences sharply reduced scientists' subsequent experimentation with the decoded genes, even if they were later placed in the public domain. Surveys have found that the risk of patent litigation deters firms from pursuing innovations. It's not that we don't need to protect intellectual property at all. But the protections must take into account that innovation is often a cumulative process, with each step piggybacking on the ideas before it. Like ''Paul's Boutique,'' the software that drives smartphones is composed of a vast array of ideas from multiple sources. Everybody infringes to some extent on everybody else. Overly strong intellectual property laws that stop creators from using earlier innovations could slow creation over all and become a barrier for new technologies to reach the market. One of Apple's patents, for instance, appears to grant it ownership over any application based on a user's location. Think of the Google map feature that pinpoints where you are. Or imagine an app showing nearby hospitals or the best deals in nearby pizzerias. If Apple enforced the patent aggressively, it could foreclose a vast array of innovation. To compound the problem, critics argue, the Patent and Trademark Office regularly issues patents on inventions that are obvious or not new. Sometimes the patents are written too broadly. Apple, for instance, has patents on the concept of moving objects around on a mobile device's screen using multiple touches. Not the specific instructions; the concept. Broad patents can even capture applications that the patent holder never envisioned. Facebook did not succeed because it was the first social networking technology. It succeeded because of how it unfolded the social networking model among student communities. Still, two months before Facebook's initial public offering, Yahoo sued it for patent infringement, arguing that ''Facebook's entire social network model, which allows users to create profiles for and connect with, among other things, persons and businesses, is based on Yahoo's patented social networking technology.'' Broad patents can hinder innovation by allowing dominant businesses to stop future inventions that would disrupt their business model. ''Who has patents?'' asked the Stanford economist Tim Bresnahan, an expert on technology policy. ''It's the guys who have been around for a while, not the guys who have done a lot of innovation lately.'' Overly broad patents have given birth to an entire new industry of ''patent trolls,'' whose only business is to buy patents and sue for royalties. TufAmerica, for instance, has made a business out of buying the rights to old songs and suing artists who sample them without permission. Intellectual property rights could be improved to better serve their purpose of encouraging innovation. Carl Shapiro, an expert on information technology on President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, has suggested patent reforms, including making it easier to challenge patents after they are issued, culling the roster of overly broad or ambiguous claims, and allowing those accused of infringement to claim independent invention as a defense. Perhaps software should not be patentable at all. In rulings since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has determined that abstract concepts like mathematical formulas cannot be patented. It has struck down two software patents and ruled against patents on diagnostic techniques because they were based on laws of nature. And it has asked an appeals court to reconsider a decision on patents over advertising online. Yet for all the concern over excess, intellectual property protections seem only to grow stronger. In 1998, for instance, Congress extended copyright protection to 70 years after the death of the author, from 50. Notably, the legislation applied to works of art that had already been created and hence needed no further incentive to come into being. Software patents will never be banned, of course. Indeed, software patents exploded after an appeals court in 1998 upheld a patent on a method to pool the assets of mutual funds using a mathematical algorithm, establishing the patentability of a business method and the software to run it. And the America Invents Act of last year, a measure expected to curb some of the excesses of patent law, came up short, allowing only a small window of time for companies to challenge new patents and forcing companies that challenged a patent to waive the right to do so again in court. Intellectual property, meanwhile, keeps growing. The United States patent office awarded 248,000 patents last year, 35 percent more than a decade ago. Some will spur innovation. But others are more likely to stop it in its tracks. E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Ad-Rock, left, and Mike D of the Beastie Boys.

201205,"RIM Shares Drop, and Analysts Warn of Further Trouble","Research in Motion'sunexpected warning that it may lose money during its current financial quarter pushed down the BlackBerry maker's already severely depressed shares on Wednesday and led several analysts to predict that worse is yet to come. Although RIM had stopped giving investors financial forecasts, largely because it had been consistently unable to meet them over the last year, it took the unusual step of issuing a statement late Tuesday saying that it might lose money during the quarter ending on Saturday. By midday Wednesday, RIM's shares traded on Nasdaq had fallen 8 percent to $10.33. While many analysts had expected that RIM might start to lose money later this fiscal year, none thought that moment would come during the current quarter. Before the announcement, the consensus of analysts was that the company would earn 42 cents a share, with the most pessimistic forecast coming in at 16 cents. Unlike many of his colleagues, Kris Thomson of National Bank Financial did not have to lower his target price for RIM's shares following the announcement. He has been predicting since December that it would fall to $8 a share. He shares the growing concern that the company's decline may reach a stage where a new line of phones and the new BlackBerry 10 operating system - which will appear at some unspecified point later this year - will not be enough to turn RIM around. In a note to investors, Mr. Thomson compared buying RIM's shares to ""going to the casino."" He added: ""If you're feeling lucky, this stock might be worth a dice-roll under $10."" Mr. Thomson wrote that RIM's announcement on Tuesday that it had hired J.P. Morgan Securities and RBC Capital Markets, a unit of the Royal Bank of Canada, to conduct a strategic review was a signal that the company was now for sale. But in his note to investors, Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley offered a different analysis. ""We do not believe RIMM is actively looking to sell the company despite the hiring of bankers to explore alternatives,"" he wrote, using the company's stock symbol. Instead, Mr. Gelblum thinks that it is more likely that RIM will only sell a part of itself, or turn over the operation of its unique global network, which provides corporate BlackBerrys with a high level of security, to another company under contract. While Thorsten Heins, RIM's president and chief executive, has said that the company would review licensing BlackBerry software to other companies, Mr. Gelblum wrote that this might actually harm the company because it would ""would just invite others to beat RIM"" using its own operating system. Mr. Gelblum forecasts that RIM's shares could drop as low as $6 or, if BlackBerry 10 is a success and the company's business outside of North America also accelerates, rise as high as $20. A year ago, RIM traded at more than $43. Mark Sue, of RBC Capital Markets, cut his forecast for RIM's share price to $11. He again warned that RIM's market share may fall below 5 percent. That level, he wrote, ""is the realm of subscale operations, razor-thin profits, and decreasing odds of a turnaround."" The company's deteriorating finances, Mr. Sue said, may hamper the BlackBerry 10 phone introduction and accelerate the move by high-end BlackBerry users in the United States to iPhones and phones based on Google's Android operating system. * Research in Motion Projects a Quarterly Loss * Consumers Less Happy With BlackBerrys * Products That Challenge RIM on Smartphone Security * RIM Looks to Sony and LightSquared for Talent * In BlackBerry Fields, Some Things Aren't Real The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120530e85u003pf ",NYT Blogs,30 May 2012,634 words,rim share drop analyst warn trouble,research motionsunexpected warning may lose money current financial quarter pushed blackberry maker already severely depressed share wednesday led several analyst predict worse yet come although rim stopped giving investor largely consistently unable meet last year took unusual step issuing statement late tuesday saying might ending saturday midday wednesday traded nasdaq fallen percent many expected start none thought moment announcement consensus company earn cent pessimistic coming unlike colleague kris thomson national bank target price following predicting since december growing concern decline stage new line phone operating system appear unspecified enough around mr thomson compared buying going casino added youre feeling lucky worth diceroll mr thomson wrote tuesday hired jp morgan security rbc capital market unit royal canada strategic review signal sale ehud gelblum morgan stanley offered analysis rimm actively looking despite hiring banker alternative wrote using symbol instead mr gelblum likely operation unique global network provides corporate high another thorsten heins president chief executive said licensing software mr gelblum wrote actually harm invite others beat mr gelblum drop success outside north america also accelerates ago traded sue rbc warned wrote realm subscale razorthin profit decreasing odds turnaround deteriorating finance mr hamper introduction highend user united iphones based google android motion project quarterly consumer le happy product challenge smartphone sony lightsquared talent field thing arent real york time document nytbeupf
201205,"UPDATE 2-Japan industrial output gains slow, stirring recovery doubts","* April output up 0.2 pct vs forecast for 0.5 pct rise * Manufacturers see May output down 3.2 pct, June up 2.4 pct * China slowdown, Europe crisis pose risks to outlook (Adds details, background) By Leika Kihara TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - Japanese factory output rose in April at a slower pace than expected, in a discouraging sign that China's slowing economy and Europe's debt crisis will weigh on Japan's fragile recovery. The data may keep the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy to keep the economy on a recovery path after it returned to growth in the first quarter from a year-end lull. Still, the central bank is expected to avoid taking further easing measures for now unless market jitters over the euro zone's woes trigger a spike in the safe-haven yen. The 0.2 percent increase in production was much slower than a 1.3 percent rise in March and less than the median estimate for a 0.5 percent gain, trade ministry data showed on Thursday, as some manufacturers curbed production due to an increase in inventories. Manufacturers said they expect output to decline in May and rebound in June, but economists said the risks from Europe's debt crisis and a rising yen are reason to be cautious about the pace of Japan's recovery. ""Growth was weaker than expected, reflecting sluggish demand for IT-related goods worldwide, particularly in China,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo. ""The forecast for May is worrisome as that would mean production would fall to levels seen last summer, and the expected rebound in June is also weak. All of this stems from a poor export environment."" The dollar fell to a 3-1/2 month low of 78.86 yen on Thursday as investors sought shelter from the euro-zone storm in the safe-harbour yen, triggering a warning from Finance Minister Jun Azumi that he was closely watching markets for any excessive moves in the Japanese currency. ASIA DEMAND WANING Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to fall 3.2 percent in May and then increase 2.4 percent in June, the data showed. Japan's economy is headed for a moderate recovery as rebuilding from a record earthquake in March 2011 gets into full swing, and government subsidies for low-emission vehicles support demand for automobiles. In a sign the recovery was broadening, wages rose for the third straight month in April and overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, gained the most in more than a year. But slowing growth in China, Europe's debt crisis and the persistent strength of the yen are clouding the outlook for the export-reliant economy. China, the world's second-largest economy and Japan's biggest trading partner, is on course this year to grow 8.2 percent, its slowest pace since 1999, according to a consensus forecast of investment bank economists in a Reuters poll. Slowing Asian demand for smartphones and game machines is starting to weigh on Japanese chip and electronic parts output, which fell 7.8 percent in April to mark the second straight month of declines, the data showed. ""The yen is strengthening but that doesn't immediately change the outlook for Japanese output. More crucial is final demand in China, as Asia-bound exports have yet to show signs of picking up,"" said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities in Tokyo. The BOJ is becoming increasingly convinced of Japan's recovery prospects and hopes that firm domestic spending, due partly to government subsidies for low-emission cars, will offset the slowdown in overseas demand. Indeed, output of cars and other transport machinery rose 6.5 percent in April. But inventories of these goods also grew 11.7 percent, and manufacturers in the sector project output to slump 13.6 percent in May, a sign the stimulus-driven boom may have peaked. ""For some models, automakers appear to have finished stocking up. Carmakers want to minimise the damage (from a slump in sales) after the subsidies expire,"" said a trade ministry official who briefed reporters on the data. The subsidies for low-emission cars will expire when money set aside for them runs out, which analysts say could be anytime during the summer or autumn of this year.

201205,FACTBOX-RIM: What are its businesses really worth?,"TORONTO, May 30 (Reuters) - Research In Motion Ltd's latest profit warning and its move to hire bankers to explore strategic options have raised speculation the BlackBerry maker might consider a piecemeal sale of its assets. Here is an overview of the assets of the one-time technology giant and some estimates on what the assets could be worth. SERVICES: RIM's services business, the core of the company's vaunted security offering, routes data through a network of servers that are spread across the globe. It is arguably the most valuable of RIM's assets and supports a subscriber base of 78 million users. Of these, analysts estimate that roughly 20 million users are enterprise or corporate users - a very attractive and hugely profitable base that would be of interest to the likes of Google Inc and Microsoft Corp, which own and license their operating systems to other handset makers such as Samsung and Nokia. The network could also be of use as a content delivery mechanism for a company such as Amazon.Com Inc . Analysts at Canaccord Genuity say that Google or Microsoft could run virtual versions of RIM's operating system on future smartphones and use RIM's network operations center (NOC) to migrate users onto rival devices down the road. ""We believe RIM's BlackBerry Enterprise Server and NOC architecture and recurring enterprise revenue stream are RIM's key strategic assets and are attractive to potential suitors,"" said Canaccord, which values the segment at about $2.75 billion. Other estimates peg the services business as being worth as much as $4.5 billion, but analysts also warn that using RIM's infrastructure to support other operating systems might be a technically challenging task. PATENTS: Ever since RIM escaped a life-threatening patent dispute in its early years, it has actively registered scores of inventions ranging from the angles on its famous thumb-friendly keyboard to its methods for synchronizing data. RIM's patent portfolio would be attractive to Google, Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Microsoft and other players in the fast growing smartphone market. Analysts and bankers value RIM's patents at somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion. But some analysts are not assigning any value to a block of patents that RIM acquired from bankrupt telecommunications company Nortel in 2011, as RIM acquired these as part of a consortium that included Apple, Microsoft, EMC Corp, Ericsson and Sony Corp. ""Given the Nortel patents are owned by a multi-company consortium controlled by majority holder Apple, we believe selling these patents could prove challenging,"" Canaccord analysts wrote in a research note to clients. HANDSETS: Analysts see little to no value in RIM's handset business, which likely lost money last year, according to some analysts who parsed the finer points of the company's filings. The big negative for RIM flagged by analysts at Nomura are the ""likely long-term losses from the device unit and the possible $2 billion needed to gradually close this unit down."" OTHER: Although many are beginning to draw parallels between former Canadian blue chip Nortel and RIM, the one major distinction is that RIM, unlike Nortel, is not burdened with debt. RIM, whose current market capitalization has fallen to about $5.5 billion, in fact has a cash reserve of about $2.1 billion. But Wall Street is ascribing little to no value to this stash, as a large part of it will likely go toward restructuring costs. Some analysts believe the company could raise some capital from the sale of buildings and other physical assets.

201205,UPDATE 2-Wall Street cuts targets as RIM reviews strategy,"* Numerous brokerages cut price targets on RIM * Analysts see odds of a turnaround at RIM fading * Stock slides further in premarket trading (Adds details, analyst comments) TORONTO, May 30 (Reuters) - Analysts cut their price targets for Research In Motion Ltd shares on Wednesday after its surprise warning of a likely fiscal first-quarter operating loss, and said the odds of a turnaround at the once iconic BlackBerry maker are fading fast. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company's announcement that it had hired bankers and commenced a strategic review did little to calm Wall Street's fears, and shares fell further before the bell on Wednesday, building on Tuesday evening losses. RIM shares fell to $10 by 0810 ET on Wednesday, after post market trading on Tuesday ended with the shares at $10.43. The stock has fallen more than 75 percent in the past 12 months and is trading at eight-year lows. ""A potential buyer remains uncertain, and potentially a long shot in our judgment,"" said Baird Equity analyst William Power in a note to clients. RIM said on Tuesday said it hired bankers from J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital to help evaluate its strategic options. But most analysts on Wall Street believe that an outright sale of the company is unlikely. ""We believe management does not intend to sell the company but rather evaluate licensing revenue opportunities,"" said Citi analyst Jim Suva in a research note. Suva, who cut his price target on RIM shares to $9.50 from $11.75, noted that RIM's earnings warning is also negative for suppliers that include Celestica Inc, Jabil Circuit Inc and Flextronics International Ltd. RIM, which was worth over $84 billion at its peak in 2008, now has a market capitalization of roughly $6 billion. It has fallen far behind Apple Inc and other rivals such as Samsung Electronics that use Google Inc's Android software. BMO Capital Markets, which also cut its price target on the stock to $9 from $11, does not see a buyer for either RIM's device business or its networks business. ""We believe the results will get worse over the next two quarters, and maybe longer,"" said BMO analyst Tim Long in a note to clients. ""We believe the subscriber base is set to start declining, and the recurring revenue should do the same."" RIM, struggling to retain top talent, has faced a series of high-level executive departures in recent weeks, and it is betting everything on the success of its next generation of BB10 smartphones that are expected to late this year. ""In our view, RIM management is still pursuing a flawed strategy,"" wrote Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey in a note to clients, arguing that RIM's plan to develop its own devices, its own operating system, and its own applications, while trying to build a robust ecosystem for third party developers is to fail.

201205,UPDATE 1-HTC says phones pass U.S. customs review,"(Adds details) TAIPEI, May 30 (Reuters) - Smartphone maker HTC said on Wednesday its latest smartphones have passed a U.S. customs review, clearing the way for it to ramp up sales in the United States as it looks to turn around a decline in what was once its largest market. Earlier in May HTC had said that U.S. sales of two new smartphones, the HTC One X and HTC EVO 4G LTE, would be delayed due to a requirement for customs inspections after the Taiwanese company lost a patent dispute with Apple Inc. That news sent its shares tumbling on concerns over its ability to win back share in the U.S. market. HTC said at the time that its new phones contained a workaround to avoid the technology covered in the patent case, but that inspections were still required. HTC has struggled to compete with Apple's iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy range, and faces a further threat after Samsung launched its latest S3 model in Europe on Tuesday In April, HTC Chief Executive Peter Chou said HTC would not return to the days when more than 50 percent of its revenue came from the United States. The company said in a brief statement on Wednesday that its phones ""met International Trade Commission standards and imports to the U.S. would proceed according to normal processes."" HTC launched the One series of models in February to lead its fight back against Apple and Samsung, giving the phones fast graphic chips and advanced music and photography functions.

201205,RIM Shares Trade Lower After CEO's Warning,"TORONTO—Research In Motion Ltd.'s shares fell sharply Wednesday as investors fled the BlackBerry maker after its chief executive warned of worse-than-expected first-quarter results and as hopes for a turnaround diminish. Shares in RIM closed 7.8% lower at $10.35 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after falling more than 10% at the start of the session. RIM Chief Executive Thorsten Heins said late Tuesday that sales of existing BlackBerrys were lagging behind rivals and that the company had hired investment banks J.P. Morgan Securities and RBC Capital Markets to help consider strategic options. RIM has said it isn't looking to sell the company, though Mr. Heins hasn't explicitly ruled out a sale. For the time being, many analysts and investors don't seem to think the prospect of a white horse buyer is worth waiting for. As its shares drop, the company's market capitalization is close to $5 billion, down from nearly $40 billion at the start of last year. The Waterloo, Ontario, company expects to report an operating loss in the fiscal first quarter, which ends June 2. RIM has stopped providing financial guidance, but analysts have been marking down their earnings estimate for the quarter for weeks—most had still figured RIM would turn a small profit in the period. The company posted a $930 million profit in the year-earlier quarter, and it has maintained an annual profit since fiscal 2004. The company, which employed more than 16,500 as of March, said it was taking additional steps to rein in costs. On Tuesday, it didn't provide details, but said there would be ""significant"" job losses in some parts of its business. RIM also said it would still be hiring to support the rollout of its new phone, the BlackBerry 10. RIM said it was targeting $1 billion in cost savings by the end of its fiscal year. RIM has been buffeted by falling BlackBerry sales globally and crumbling market share in the lucrative North American smartphone market amid competition by Apple Inc.'s iPhones and devices run off Google Inc.'s Android operating system. Over the past year, RIM has announced a series of profit warnings and—more recently—several quarters of slowing BlackBerry sales around the world. RIM first unveiled its strategic review in March shortly after Mr. Heins took the reins from longtime co-Chief Executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, who stepped down from management early in the year. Since then, Mr. Heins has presided over a wide-ranging restructuring of the company's top ranks.

201205,China Clears Apple Sales of 3G Device,"BEIJING—Chinese regulators have approved an Apple Inc. device with high-speed wireless-data capabilities, suggesting that the U.S. computer maker is one step closer to selling the latest version of its iPad in China. According to the website of China's Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center, an Apple device with third-generation, or 3G, data capabilities has been issued the license needed for the company to begin sales in China. The device would be compatible with the network of China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., Apple's longtime partner in releasing its popular iPhone and iPad devices. The notice on the website didn't name the device, listed as ""model number A1430."" Apple's other devices capable of receiving cellular-network data, including the latest versions of its iPhone as well as earlier versions of its iPad, already have been approved for use and are being sold in China. Vendors often begin selling new devices within weeks of network-access licenses being granted. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A China Unicom spokeswoman also declined to comment. Though China is Apple's second-largest market, behind the U.S., the company has been slow to release the new iPad, which has come out in most developed and many other developing countries, such as Venezuela and Malaysia. The company hasn't given a reason for the slow release in China. But the approval comes amid a continuing lawsuit between Apple and electronics maker Proview International Holding Ltd. and its subsidiaries over the trademark of Apple's tablet computer. Proview Shenzhen, the mainland China subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Proview International Holding, registered a trademark years earlier for a product called IPAD that has been discontinued. It contends it still rightfully owns the China rights to the name. Apple has argued that it purchased the rights from Proview as part of a 2009 agreement. It is appealing a decision by a lower court that sided with the Chinese company. China Unicom—China's second-largest mobile operator by subscribers, after China Mobile Ltd.—has invested large amounts in infrastructure for 3G services. In a news briefing earlier this year, the company said it expects its 3G mobile-phone business to generate a profit in 2012, as the popularity of smartphones and tablet devices has led consumers to switch to 3G service plans.

201205,HTC Shipments Clear U.S. Customs Review,"TAIPEI—HTC Corp. cleared a critical hurdle in one of its key markets when all of its shipments to the U.S.—including the latest EVO 4G LTE and One series smartphones—passed customs review, fulfilling a precondition for imports set by a U.S. trade body, the company said Wednesday. ""The devices were released and will reach customers in the U.S. soon,"" said an official from HTC. The Taiwan mobile-phone maker said it had worked around the design of the new phones to avoid the disputed technology that was ruled by the International Trade Commission to be in violation of a patent held by Apple Inc. Shares in HTC fell 1.9% to 424 New Taiwan dollars (US$14.31) in Taipei on Wednesday.' While analysts say that both the EVO 4G and One series smartphones are important for HTC in its quest to maintain, or gain, market share in the U.S., the Taiwan company continues to face an uphill battle against dominant rivals Apple Inc. of the U.S. and Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea. The HTC official said future shipments to the U.S. will continue to be inspected by customs due to an order issued by the ITC in December that took effect April 19, but declined to say whether the latest go-ahead issued by U.S. Customs implies that future inspections will require less time. The ITC order requires all HTC shipments—both existing and coming models—to the U.S. after April 19 to be inspected and cleared by U.S. Customs before reaching customers. ""Future inspections will likely take less time, which is a relief. But the fundamentals are still not optimistic, as competition from [Samsung's] Galaxy III and [Apple's] iPhone will continue to be tough,"" said KGI Securities analyst Richard Ko. HTC said last week that some shipments of EVO 4G phones were already cleared by U.S. Customs by May 22, but the HTC official on Wednesday declined to give a specific launch date for the EVO 4G phones in the U.S. The launch of this model was delayed from May 18 due to the customs review. But according to the website of Sprint, HTC's designated network carrier for EVO 4G phones in the U.S., the phones were delivered starting Thursday to customers who preordered the phone. HTC earlier said that the inspection could also disrupt future sales of its One series of smartphones, which were released in the U.S. last month before the customs inspection order took effect. While some shipments of One phones already have reached U.S. carriers and have been sold, prolonged customs reviews might result in a shortage of the handsets when inventories run out, the company said earlier. As HTC's sales in the U.S. remain weak, the company has been turning to Asia and other emerging markets for growth. But some analysts have questioned the company's strategy, saying that it would be tough for HTC, which lacks the cachet of Apple or Samsung, to compete against Chinese handset makers, which offer smartphones at lower prices. Like HTC, Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. also produce smartphones with advanced features. Write to Aries Poon at aries.poon@dowjones.com Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,Prospects Dim for BlackBerry Maker; Research In Motion Hires Two Advisers to Evaluate Options And Warns of More Losses; Shares Tumble 7% After Hours,"Research In Motion Ltd. warned its business is deteriorating and will likely lose money for the second straight quarter, underscoring the uphill battle to turn around its flagging BlackBerry smartphone business. The dire outlook comes as RIM scrambles to cut costs ahead of the rollout of its next BlackBerry expected this year. RIM is depending on this phone and a new mobile operating system to rescue the business, yet it still hasn't provided a date for the debut. Analysts have been marking down their earnings estimate for the quarter for weeks, but most had still figured RIM would turn a small profit in the period. The company posted a $930 million profit in the year-earlier quarter, and it has maintained an annual profit since fiscal 2004. RIM also said Tuesday it had hired outside advisers to help its board to figure out how to salvage—or possibly sell parts of—its business. The company said it hired bankers at J.P. Morgan Securities and RBC Capital to assist in a previously announced strategic review of options. Representatives at RBC and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. The banks are helping executives ""evaluate the relative merits and feasibility of various financial strategies, including opportunities to leverage the BlackBerry platform through partnerships, licensing opportunities and strategic business model alternatives,"" said Chief Executive Thorsten Heins in a statement. RIM shares fell 7.9% to $10.34 in after-hours trading, pushing the Canadian company's market capitalization under $6 billion, down from more than $39 billion at the start of last year. Mr. Heins has said he isn't looking to sell the company but has also declined to specifically rule that option out. In Tuesday's statement, RIM didn't say whether it was now looking actively for a buyer. A RIM spokeswoman said the company still believed ""the best way to drive value for our stakeholders is to execute on our plan to turn the company around."" The company, which employed more than 16,500 as of March, said it was taking additional steps to rein in costs. On Tuesday, it didn't provide details, but said there would be ""significant"" job losses in some parts of its business. RIM also said it would still be hiring to support the rollout of its new phone, the BlackBerry 10. RIM said it was targeting $1 billion in cost savings by the end of its fiscal year. RIM has been buffeted by falling BlackBerry sales globally and crumbling market share in the lucrative North American smartphone market amid competition by Apple Inc.'s iPhones and devices run off of Google Inc.'s Android operating system. Over the past year, RIM has announced a series of profit warnings and—more recently—several quarters of slowing BlackBerry sales around the world. RIM first unveiled its strategic review in March shortly after Mr. Heins took the reins from long time co-chiefs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, who stepped down from management early in the year. Since then, Mr. Heins has presided over a wide-ranging restructuring of the company's top ranks. The company has announced the departure of a series of high-ranking RIM executives—including in the past week its top lawyer and its head of global sales. But it has also brought on a handful of new executives in recent weeks. Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, said he still wasn't expecting RIM to sell itself this year. But meanwhile, investors may not see any move short of an outright sale as a radical enough move in the effort to bolster RIM's position. ""This isn't really a transition yet,"" Mr. Gillis said. ""This is really just a downward slide."" Investors sold off shares Tuesday after the news was announced, mostly spooked by the disclosure that the company now expects to report an operating loss in its fiscal first quarter ending June 2. RIM cited falling sales volumes and competitive pricing for the expected loss. Analysts have said the company may be forced to write down more inventory as unsold BlackBerrys and its poor-selling PlayBook tablet stack up in warehouses. Last year, RIM took a nearly half-billion-dollar write-down on unsold PlayBooks. In its last fiscal quarter, it wrote down $267 million in unsold BlackBerrys. Mr. Heins didn't give any cause for short-term optimism. ""Our financial performance will continue to be challenging for the next few quarters,"" he said in the statement. But RIM also said its cash holdings would increase in the quarter, from last period's $2.1 billion stockpile. That is still a healthy cushion, and with RIM essentially debt free, it could alleviate some worry that RIM risks burning through cash as it scrambles to unroll its next phone by year-end.

201205,"RIM's value sinks as BlackBerrys are edged out, but patents and network could entice buyer","WATERLOO, Ontario (AP) - Research In Motion Ltd., the maker of the BlackBerry, is in steep decline. The company, once the crown jewel of the Canadian technology industry, is now worth 1 percent of Apple's market capitalization. One way for RIM to stop the downward tailspin: It could sell itself to a competitor or financial firm. But who would step up to buy RIM --and why? Late Tuesday, the company said it expects to post an operating loss for the current quarter, a sign that BlackBerry sales are falling even faster than analysts expected. On Wednesday, the company's stock hit its lowest level since 2003, the year RIM went from making two-way e-mail pagers to smartphones. The stock has fallen 93 percent since their peak in 2008. Since then, the BlackBerry's dominance as the smartphone for on-the-go business people has been eviscerated by Apple Inc.'s iPhone, and more recently, by phones running Google Inc.'s Android software. Research firm IDC says BlackBerrys now account for 6.4 percent of the global smartphone market, a third of what they had two years ago. In that time, the company's financial performance has suffered. RIM reported a 25 percent revenue decline in the latest fiscal quarter, to $4.2 billion from $5.6 billion. For the full fiscal year that ended on March 3, it earned $1.2 billion, or $2.22 per share, on revenue of $18.4 billion. That's down from net income of $3.4 billion, or $6.34 a share, on revenue of $19.9 billion in fiscal 2011. RIM issued the dire warning about its business Tuesday, adding that it will lay off a ""significant"" number of employees. Still, the company is defiant. Chief executive, Thorsten Heins, says he can turn things around with the help of fresh smartphone software. Heins joined RIM four years ago and was most recently its chief operating officer. He replaced co-CEOs Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis in January after the company lost tens of billions in market value. ""My charter from the board of directors is very clear: long-term value creation with RIM,"" Heins told The Associated Press in an interview at the company's headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario, earlier this month. Analysts give RIM only a slight chance of coming out of the crisis. To hedge its bets, the company has hired bankers to look at its options. It's not actively looking to sell itself, Heins said, but it wants to be prepared. ""We are prudent because we know the situation is somewhat challenging,"" Heins said. ""So we are just looking at everything that could be an option. That doesn't mean we are pulling on those options. But we need to understand ... what is our field of action that we could take in case we need to?"" As RIM's prospects worsened, last year marked a turning point in the way analysts assess RIMs value. Instead of treating it like a company with a future, they started looking at it as a collection of parts that could be split up and sold separately to the highest bidder. Michael Walkley at Canaccord Genuity believes most of the company's value lies in the monthly fees it gets from phone companies in exchange for running the systems that deliver email and Web pages to BlackBerrys. RIM has 78 million users connected to this system, but Walkley estimates that only 20 million are corporate and government users who are likely to stick around because of the communications security RIM provides. The rest are consumers who will jump to competing phones, he believes. That business is worth about $2.75 billion to a competitor, Walkley wrote in a research report Wednesday. The other major component of RIM's value is its patent portfolio. The company had an early scare in U.S. patent courts in 2006, when it was forced to pay $612.5 million to a small company founded by an inventor who had patents on wireless e-mail delivery. Since then, it's filed for thousands of patents to use as a defense against future suits. Patents on wireless technologies exploded in value last year, as Apple and Microsoft Corp. started suing makers of phones that run Google's Android software. Countersuits followed. A consortium that included Apple and RIM bought the patents of a defunct Canadian maker of telecommunications gear, Nortel, for $4.5 billion last year. That compares with the $1.13 billion Nortel's once-prominent wireless networks business fetched in 2009. As a counter-move, Google bolstered its own patent portfolio by buying Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., a U.S. phone maker with only slightly better prospects than RIM, for $12.5 billion. Where does that leave RIM? Christopher Marlett, the CEO of MDB Capital, said RIM's patents are worth more than $1 billion, and could be worth as much as $4 billion if a bidding war develops between Apple, Google, Microsoft Corp. and perhaps Samsung Electronics Co. ""It's a question of how aggressive they get,"" Marlett said. His firm is an investment bank that focuses on intellectual property, including patents. Walkley puts the value of RIM's portfolio at $2.5 billion, excluding the patents RIM bought from Nortel and shares with Apple, Microsoft and other buyers. RIM has $2.1 billion in cash, but Walkley discounts this completely, since the phone business will likely start using up cash soon, and downsizing will require severance payments. That means the email network and the patents comprise RIM's entire value at $5.25 billion, by his estimate. That's very close to RIM's current market capitalization, at $5.4 billion, though a buyer could be expected to pay a premium. The cash cushion also means that RIM is in no imminent danger of going bankrupt. But as the shares decline, RIM is likely to face increasing pressure from shareholders to unlock the company's value through a sale, and to abandon the comeback plan. A possible middle ground would be to sell the patent portfolio while keeping the rest of the company. Two months ago, AOL, once a pioneering Internet service provider, sold and licensed its patents --which are more modest than RIM's for $1 billion-- to Microsoft. Microsoft is one company that's been suggested as a potential RIM buyer. The software juggernaut is trying to get back into smartphone software, but its Windows Phones haven't been popular so far. Buying RIM could give it a chance to establish itself as a provider of trusted wireless email services, though moving subscribers from BlackBerry to Windows could be challenging. ------ AP Technology Writer Peter Svensson contributed from New York. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Stocks lose big as Europe worries stalk Wall Street; 10-year Treasury yield at postwar low,"Fearing a financial rupture in Europe, investors around the world fled from risk Wednesday. They punished stocks and the euro and flocked to bonds, driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to its lowest point since World War II. In the United States, where concerns about Europe have already wiped out most of the strong gain that stocks had from January through March, major averages fell more than 1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 161 points. With Spain's banking system teetering and Greece's political future unclear ahead of crucial elections next month, European stocks lost even more. The euro dropped below $1.24, to its lowest point since the summer of 2010. ""Everyone's just afraid that if Europe doesn't get its act together, there will be a big spillover in the U.S.,"" said Peter Tchir, manager of the hedge fund TF Market Advisors. He said the uncertainty in Europe was reminiscent of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, when it was briefly unclear in the United States whether banks would be bailed out and ""we had these giant swings up and down."" Wall Street, which woke up to increased anxiety over higher Spanish borrowing rates, was down from the opening bell. The Dow closed down 160.83 points, or 1.3 percent, at 12,419.86. The Dow has had a miserable May, losing more than 6 percent, and is on track for its first losing month since September. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 19.10 points to 1,313.32. The Nasdaq composite index fell 33.63 to 2,837.36. Energy stocks were hit hardest because of a big drop in the price of oil, but stocks in all major industries fell. The trigger for Wednesday's sell-off was Spain, where the banking system is under strain a week after its fourth-largest bank required $23.8 billion in government aid to cover souring real estate loans. Investors are increasingly worried that problems at the bank, Bankia, might recur at other Spanish banks. Many lent heavily during the nation's real estate bubble. Losses from the real estate crash might be too big for Spain's government to shoulder. On Wednesday, borrowing rates rose sharply for Spain and Italy, which are seen as the latest problem cases in a debt crisis that has rocked global markets for more than two years. Traders dumped bonds issued by those governments. The yield on Spain's 10-year bonds, a key indicator of market confidence in the country's ability to continue to make payments on its debt, shot as high as 6.69 percent, the highest since the euro currency was launched in 2002. Intense demand for low-risk, easily tradable securities led investors to buy U.S. government debt. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged to 1.61 percent from 1.74 percent late Tuesday. Wednesday's yield appeared to be the lowest since 1945, said Bill O'Donnell, head of U.S. Treasury strategy at the Royal Bank of Scotland, citing data from the European Central Bank and other sources. Federal Reserve daily records only go back to 1962, and those reflect a previous record of 1.70 percent, set May 17. ""There's just a massive flight to safe-haven assets today,"" O'Donnell said. He characterized the rush into U.S. bonds by citing a well-known, unsavory analogy made by Richard Fisher, the head of the Federal Reserve's Dallas bank: ""The U.S. is the prettiest horse in the glue factory."" Yields on German government bonds, also seen as safe, turned lower, too. Concern about Europe was everywhere: The European Commission said consumer confidence fell sharply across the region last month. Spaniards withdrew money from their banks, a trend that could force more banks to demand government aid. Fear also spread about the Spanish government's ability to go on without itself being bailed out. Spain's main stock index closed down 2.6 percent. An opinion poll in Greece showed that the far-left Syriza party is gaining support ahead of elections June 17. Syriza opposes the system of bailouts and sharp budget cuts that have kept Greece afloat but also gutted its economy. If the party wins, Greece may be forced to exit the euro currency. Uncertainty about the future of the currency union would likely boost borrowing costs across the region, threatening nations that have received bailouts, like Portugal, and those that might need them, like Italy. Until the Greek elections next month, things will be too uncertain for the U.S. market to sustain a meaningful rally, said David Kelly, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. If Greece's leaders allow the bailouts to continue and European governments start spending to spur growth, Kelly expects the market eventually to rise. If Syriza wins and Greece is expelled from the euro, he expects a volatile market for months. Amid the tumult, the European Commission called on the 17 countries that use the currency to create a ""banking union"" that can centrally oversee and, if needed, bail out national banks. If Europe's financial crisis plunges it into a deep recession, global economic growth will likely falter, reducing demand for commodities and machines that power growth. Fearing that outcome, traders pushed the stocks of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and aluminum company Alcoa to among the biggest declines of the 30 companies that make up the Dow. The euro fell as low as $1.2360, the lowest since the summer of 2010. Benchmark stock indexes closed down 2.2 percent in France and 1.8 percent in Italy and Germany. When banks and big investors get frightened, they sell stocks of all countries and the bonds of countries in trouble. They buy Japanese yen, German bonds and especially U.S. Treasurys. Such purchases are not about turning a profit, said O'Donnell of RBS. That's why German government two-year notes are paying zero percent: People are simply handing their money over for safekeeping. The U.S. Treasury market is still considered one of the safest places in the world to stash billions in a hurry. At $11 trillion, no other market is as large, so there's always somebody ready to buy or sell Treasurys. ""When people just want to get their money back, there's not a lot of competition,"" O'Donnell said. Food and energy commodities fell sharply. Crude oil lost more than $3 to below $88 a barrel. Crude has been falling steadily since the beginning of May, when it traded as high as $106 a barrel. Kelly, of J.P. Morgan Funds, said investors should remember that the U.S. is on firmer economic footing than Europe, and make sure their portfolios could withstand a market rally or a downturn, because both outcomes look possible. ""Things could be much better, or much worse, than the markets have priced in,"" Kelly said. ""The only logical investment strategy is to be balanced -- to get to the middle of the boat."" Among U.S. stocks making moves: -- Monsanto, the agricultural company, was one of the few big gainers in a sea of red. It jumped 2.2 percent after its CEO said this year's earnings will likely surge 25 percent, far more than Wall Street had been expecting. Sales were strong in its seed and chemicals business, including Roundup herbicides. -- Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, plunged 7.1 percent after the company said late Tuesday it had hired a team of bankers to help it weigh its options -- Wall Street jargon for a possible sale or reorganization.

The revamped Chrome operating system, announced Tuesday by Google, plays high-definition video, has a rebuilt trackpad and is even designed to work on future touch-screen models. None of which matters if Google cannot get computers that use it out into the world, something that is proving as big a challenge as engineering Chrome. One thing is certain, however: Google is not giving up. It is heading to retail outlets, showcasing the machines as cheap and easy to manage corporate devices, and rethinking how it sells products for education. Executives involved with Chrome say Google doesn't care if it takes years for the Chrome operating system to catch on. (Google also calls its Web browser Chrome.) ""What I am sure of is the level of commitment inside the company,"" said Sundar Pichai, the head of Chrome at Google. ""The Chrome browser was at a 3 percent share after a year. Android had little share over a year. It takes time."" The browser has at least a fifth of the market, enough to make it a serious contender against Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Android is the most widely used smartphone operating system. Since its first appearance in July 2009, the Linux-based Chrome operating system has been intended for people who live online. The name shared with Google's Web browser underscores both the Chrome operating system's requirement of an Internet connection to obtain access to most applications, and Google's desire to tie together many products, like documents, e-mail and social networking. There are a lot more people living online than three years ago, but still few of them using Chrome computers. Chromebook sales are so small that NPD Group, a research firm that tracks sales numbers for electronics, declined to disclose them. Stephen Baker, an analyst with NPD, said retail distribution for these notebooks is poor, and the bigger PC manufacturers like Dell and Hewlett-Packard are not making them. He said that Google will need to rethink how these computers will be portrayed to everyday shoppers in a store. It won't be easy for a Best Buy employee, for example, to sell a computer that appears to just run a Web browser. ""It's not an easy message to convey,"" he said. ""For consumers, it's a niche product. It has a very limited customer base through a very small number of outlets."" Laptops using Chrome, called Chromebooks, are currently made by Acer and Samsung. There are also desktop models, called Chromeboxes. Mr. Pichai has been showing off new laptops and desktops from Samsung, and says Acer will also be working with the new version of the Chrome OS. More manufacturers will be selling machines, possibly including touch-screen tablets, by Christmas, he said, but he did not identify the manufacturers. Some Best Buy outlets will sell the machines, which so far have only been available online. That could increase sales, since most people still like to go to physical stores and touch new machines before they buy them. The real future for these products, however, may begin in fleet-type sales to business and schools. The laptops cost $450, and the desktops $329, far less than most computers. More important, they can be centrally configured and managed, which means they could be attractive for use in call centers, schools or other places that tend to use the same software over large groups. Google is also looking at new ways to price the machines for schools. A year ago, Google tried selling them on a low per-month charge. That proved hard to work out with the typical annual budgets of most school systems. To date, more than 500 schools are using Chrome machines. That is not many, considering there are over 20,000 school systems, school districts, colleges and universities in the United States. Steve Ballmer, the chief executive of Google's archrival, Microsoft, likes to say, ""We just keep coming and coming and coming."" Google is almost as rich, and just as tenacious. * New Google Chrome Aims at Windows 8 * Hints of a $199 Tablet and 3-D Chromebook * Google Makes Its Chrome Browser Mobile * Google Opens Pop-Up Shops for a Hands-On Chromebook Experience * Google's Chrome Laptops to Go on Sale in June The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120529e85t005bp ",NYT Blogs,29 May 2012,754 words,buy chromebooks google keep pushing,pm updated added comment interview npd analyst brian x chen revamped chrome operating system announced tuesday google play highdefinition video rebuilt trackpad even designed future touchscreen model none matter get computer use world something proving big challenge engineering one certain however heading retail outlet showcasing machine cheap easy manage corporate device rethinking sell product education executive involved say doesnt year also call web browser commitment inside company said sundar pichai percent share android little time least fifth market enough serious contender mozillas firefox microsofts internet explorer widely used smartphone since first appearance july linuxbased intended people live online shared underscore requirement connection access application desire tie together many like document email social networking lot living three ago using chromebook sale npd group research firm track number electronics declined disclose stephen baker npd distribution notebook poor bigger pc manufacturer dell hewlettpackard making portrayed everyday shopper store wont best buy employee appears message consumer niche limited customer base laptop called chromebooks currently made acer samsung desktop called chromeboxes mr pichai showing new samsung acer working version o selling possibly including tablet christmas identify far available increase since physical touch real may fleettype business school cost le important centrally configured managed attractive center tend software looking way tried permonth charge proved hard typical annual budget date considering district college university united steve ballmer chief archrival microsoft coming almost rich tenacious window chromebook mobile open popup handson chromebook june york nytbetbp
201205,Morning Take-Out,"Dewey & LeBoeuf Files for Bankruptcy  |  Dewey & LeBoeuf, the law firm crippled by financial miscues and partner defections, filed for bankruptcy on Monday night, punctuating the largest law firm collapse in United States history. The filing, made in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, is the final chapter in a turbulent period for Dewey, which came apart after disappointing profits and prodigious debt forced it to slash partners' salaries. The partners, already owed millions from previous years, grew concerned over the firm's finances and their ability to get paid. A partner exodus destroyed the firm. Dewey announced on Monday that the firm planned to liquidate. It said it would ask about 90 employees to remain on staff to assist in winding down its business. The firm has $315 million in liabilities, of which $225 million is owed to its banks, according to the court filings. Other creditors include the firm's landlords and former partners owed money. ""This is a very sad day for the legal profession,"" said Richard J. Holwell, a former federal judge in Manhattan now in private practice. ""Dewey is a fabled firm with a lot of great lawyers, and a demise of this magnitude is unprecedented.""

She was 22. Ms. Keegan once wrote a guest column for DealBook, arguing that college students should try to resist the allure of a high-paying job in finance after graduation. Drawing on interviews with her peers, she tapped into a national debate on the financial services industry. ""Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but I think most young, ambitious people want to have a positive impact on the world. Whether it's through art or activism or advances in science, almost every student I spoke to had some kind of larger, altruistic goal in life,"" she wrote.

201205,"INSTANT VIEW 6-RIM enlists JPMorgan, RBC in review, warns of loss","(Adds commentary) May 29 (Reuters) - Blackberry-maker Research in Motion , which has steadily ceded market share to Apple Inc and Google Inc in the hotly contested global smartphone arena, has hired JP Morgan and RBC Capital Markets to help review its struggling business. The company, which some analysts say may try to put itself up for sale, expects to post an operating loss in the current quarter. Commentary: ED SNYDER, ANALYST, CHARTER EQUITY RESEARCH ""RIM is on the downward slope and its going to get steeper. The new management is rightly evaluating all the alternatives to try to stave off what will inevitably be greater losses. ""I don't think anybody's going to buy them so much as split up the company. Jim Balsillie left because he was proposing splitting the company into hardware and software. ""You're not going to sell RIM whole. The most valuable part of RIM today is the server business. The hardware business is a mess and probably going to get worse. ""The biggest problem RIM faces is that it's a very illiquid market in suitors for its phone business. There's very few companies that could exploit RIM's (hardware) assets to make a go of it. Those who can are already beating the pants off RIM. ""On the services side, you could see Microsoft picking that up, or Apple or even Samsung. Anybody who wants a stronger base in the enterprise."" DANIEL ERNST, ANALYST, HUDSON SQUARE RESEARCH ""The layoffs are not new. The most interesting thing that came out of that press release is that they are going to have a loss in some operations. That's certainly below our expectations and below the Street. ""In the broader scheme of things it's not a surprise. RIM is stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. On the high end they're getting crushed by Apple. At the low end they are getting crushed by Android. In overseas markets where you can get a $100 Android phone, it does Web browsing, email and apps. It may not be a great phone but it does all these modern things we're used to. ""RIM doesn't have a product at the high end and doesn't have a product at the bottom end. Meanwhile their core corporate customers have been slowly churning out to Apple. They have a lot of work cut for them. ""RIM's core issue is their product. It doesn't matter how much they cut costs or how many bankers they hire if it doesn't have a product to sell. "" SCOTT SUTHERLAND, ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES ""They need to take a long hard look at themselves. As long as they stick with this integrated strategy, they'll always be playing catch-up but never get to where Apple and others are. At the end of the day, being an integrated business will go the way of Palm. They really need to rethink how to become part of a bigger ecosystem. ""They have a lot of tangible assets, they have their patent portfolio, they have the enterprise mobility platform and they have the device business. In their integration of all that they're so far behind, I just think sticking to that, maybe you have a long slow death. By separating those units, I think you can get some value off the different pieces. ""Nokia has shown how to do it right. They're going to take a lot of pain over at Nokia, but they've made the tough decision to become part of a larger ecosystem."" JOHN JACKSON, ANALYST, CCS INSIGHT ""By engaging the bankers, you just have that elevated possibility of strategic action. Nothing strategic happens until you hire the bankers. ""RIM has assets that might be valuable to various parties broken up, they might be valuable collectively. I think there are quite a number of plausible scenarios out there, not the least of which is still an organic recovery. I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that they can't restructure effectively. ""It is clear that the investment community has lost patience with RIM and that is going to weigh on their ability to recover organically. ""There is zero surprise in the matter that RIM is guiding toward on operating loss this quarter, and that they're going to continue to have a tough time - no real surprises there. ""The collective assets that comprise BB10 are formidable and I think the market overlooks that. ""The market has perhaps been a little bit myopic in not appreciating the extent to which those assets look like the future."" EHUD GELBLUM, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY ""Bankers do a lot more than buy and sell, certainly finding a buyer is one the things they do, but in this case it would be an option of last resort. The bankers ""are there to help them restructure, from outsourcing pieces of it, selling divisions etcetera so that the cost structure will come down. ""They will be a much, much smaller company. They have to bring down the cost structure in a hurry so they don't get to the point that they go bankrupt until they have a new product. Is there a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? The odds are definitely against them. ""They could have the best product but the way the market has developed - set up for Android and iOS and maybe Microsoft - it's really hard to see it would be receptive for a fourth."" MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER, WEDBUSH MORGAN, LOS ANGELES ""Clearly a big disappointment. I can't say it's going to take people completely by surprise from a trader standpoint, but the magnitude of the miss: they didn't quantify it, they just said it's going to be an operating loss. And the consensus estimate for the quarter is 41 cents, so you know it's going to be at least 42 cents below estimates. ""I don't think it's a surprise that guidance is being lowered, but I think the magnitude of the disappointment below estimates is definitely a negative surprise. ""They did say that they hired JP Morgan and RBC to evaluate options, so that might be a potential saving grace for the stock. I don't think any options are off the table, whether it be licensing their proprietary software or putting the company completely up for sale. ""It is further validation that the iPhone and Android are continuing to dominate the smartphone space, and you are seeing the clear losers being RIM and Nokia."" ALEX GAUNA, ANALYST, JMP ""We were all anticipating this anyway. But there isn't a lot of detail around it. How deep is the loss? ""They're clearly moving in the wrong direction right now, so I found it a little frustrating that there wasn't more detail. It wasn't as helpful as it could have been. ""If they're really trying to repair their relationship with Wall Street and investors, this was not all that helpful."" COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS ""Everyone talks about the transition, but in order to have a transition, you need to have something to transition to. ""We're not even at the point where this is a transition, this is just a downward slope right now. ""They're talking about (Blackberry) 10, but 10 is going to be in the back half of the year... That's also part of it."" MARK MCKECHNIE, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY LLC ""Clearly its a special situation stock. It's having trouble competing with Android and Apple for the No.3 place.

201205,"UPDATE 4-RIM hires bankers for strategic review, forecasts Q1 loss","* RIM says will cut ""significant"" number of job * JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Canada hired as advisers * Shares down almost 13 percent in after-market trade (Updates with details, background on previous deal discussions) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 29 (Reuters) - Research In Motion Ltd has hired bankers for a far-reaching strategic review and to look for partnerships as the BlackBerry-maker warned it would likely report a shock fiscal first-quarter operating loss. RIM virtually invented the concept of on-your-hip email with its first BlackBerry devices, but now finds itself struggling badly in the smartphone market as it trails far behind Apple Inc and other rivals such as Samsung Electronics that use Google Inc's Android software. RIM said it would also cut a ""significant"" number of jobs, although it did not say how many. Two sources with close connections to RIM have said it plans to slash its workforce closer to 10,000 by early next year from 16,500 currently. The lack of details about the size of the loss and the job losses disappointed some analysts. ""They're clearly moving in the wrong direction right now, so I found it a little frustrating that there wasn't more detail,"" said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""That is a disaster. It's really bad. We did not expect an operating loss this quickly,"" said Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. RIM's shares, down more than 75 percent over the past 12 months and trading at eight-year lows, slumped nearly 13 percent to around $9.77 a share in after-market trading, although they pulled back slightly to be last quoted at $10.38. About four years ago they traded at more than $140. Mark McKechnie, an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC, put RIM's value at ""about $10 per share,"" reflecting what its portfolio of technology patents might bring in a sale. RIM is also struggling to retain its top talent after a series of high-level executive departures in recent weeks. RIM said on Monday that its chief legal officer was resigning and its head of global sales resigned last week to take a job at audio company Sonos. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company hired bankers from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBC Capital Markets to help the company evaluate strategies, including a possible overhaul of its business model, as well as other moves such as expanding the BlackBerry platform through partnerships and licensing deals. TAKEOVER TALKS SET ASIDE Last year, RIM held numerous takeover discussions with potential buyers ranging from Amazon and Microsoft Corp to private equity firms, sources have previously told Reuters. But those talks never resulted in an M&A transaction under former co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie. By the end of last year, RIM management had set aside any options for a sale and focused on trying to turn the company's fortunes around. JPMorgan and RBC were brought in shortly after the announcement that RIM would pursue strategic alternatives in March, said one source close to the matter. ""These advisors have been tasked to help us with the strategic review we referenced on our year-end financial results conference call and to evaluate the relative merits and feasibility of various financial strategies,"" RIM CEO Thorsten Heins said in a statement. RIM was not specific about the size of the likely loss in the quarter ending June 2. Before the warning, analysts had expected RIM's earnings to fall to 42 cents a share and revenue to slip to $3.64 billion, according to analyst views collated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RIM is due to release the results on June 28. In March, RIM posted a net loss of $125 million on the back of an inventory write-down for phones launched last year. Excluding those one-time items, RIM reported an adjusted profit of $418 million. Heins stressed that he planned to maintain spending and hiring for the development of the next-generation BlackBerry 10 phones and to expand its catalog of third-party applications. A dearth of apps compared with the number available for Apple and Android-based devices has been a major drag on RIM's sales. RIM's biggest selling point is that other smartphone makers still cannot compete with the security features on RIM's devices, something that has made the BlackBerry a crucial tool for police, government and military use. RIM said its subscriber base grew to 78 million users, up 1 million from the previous quarter ended March 29. But growth was slower than in any recent quarter. RIM's market share is falling by the month and the company is pinning its hopes on the BlackBerry 10 models, featuring a new operating system that RIM says will let it compete more effectively against Apple and others. But the new devices won't be released until later this year, pointing to further difficult quarters to come. ""I don't see the tide turning,"" said Misek. ""The problem is the BlackBerry 10 handsets aren't coming out next quarter, so you know next quarter is going to most likely be worse. Then you look at the November quarter, when we'll probably get the BB10 handsets and at the same time we'll have the iPhone 5. So that quarter is probably going to be bad. ""So we have a string of bad quarters coming and it really is tough to see how it's going to get better.""

201205,Family feud may disrupt Samsung succession plans,"SEOUL, May 30 (Reuters) - A family feud at Samsung Group, parent of the world's largest electronics company by revenue, could upset the smooth handover of control of a smartphones-to-ships conglomerate whose $234 billion annual sales are bigger than the economy of Singapore. Lee Kun-hee, South Korea's richest man and chairman of Samsung Electronics, on Wednesday defends three lawsuits from his elder brother, Lee Maeng-hee, a sister and another relative, who claim $1 billion of assets - mainly shares in Samsung Life, an insurance company at the heart of a web of Samsung Group cross-shareholdings. Lee Kun-hee is unlikely to attend the case at the Seoul Central District Court. There's little chance of Lee losing control of Samsung, but the legal wrangling over a small part of the Samsung fortune - a day after the enthusiastic launch of Samsung's latest Galaxy S3 smartphone - may dent plans to eventually hand over the reins to his only son, Jay Lee. The hearing may also shed more light on how the Lee family maintains its grip on a sprawling group, some details of which emerged in a 2008 lawsuit when Kun-hee was found guilty of financial wrongdoing and tax evasion that eventually led to the current suit. ""It's generally not in one's favour to bet against the House of Samsung and the chairman for domestic legal issues - where such influence often transcends economic borders into legal ones,"" said Jasper Kim, a professor of international business law and finance at Ewha University's graduate school. In an unusually public spat at the top of one of the country's famed chaebol - the family-owned industrial groups that wield huge economic and political clout - Maeng-hee, who is in his 80s, has called his younger septuagenarian brother ""greedy"" and ""childish"". Kun-hee retorts that Maeng-hee was turfed out of the family and not judged fit to lead Samsung by their father Lee Byung-chull, who founded the group in 1938. EVER EVERLAND The Samsung Group is effectively controlled by Samsung Everland, a small zoo and theme park company with equity capital of just $10.7 million. If Kun-hee's stake in Samsung Life falls below Everland's, under South Korean law Everland would be considered a financial holding company, requiring it and companies under its control to sell stakes in non-financial companies, including Samsung Electronics. Maeng-hee, the eldest son of Samsung's founder, and his sister are seeking a quarter of Kun-hee's stake in Samsung Life. Kun-hee is the biggest shareholder of Samsung Life, with a 20.76 percent stake, followed by Everland with 19.34 percent. As part of the web of cross-holdings, Samsung Life owns 7.21 percent of Samsung Electronics, which owns 35.29 percent of Samsung Card , which holds 8.64 percent of Everland. ""Lee (Kun-hee) would prefer to settle in cash because losing some of his stake in Samsung Life could spark a bigger ownership restructuring in key Samsung companies,"" said Jun Yong-ki, an analyst at Hyundai Securities. Buying more Samsung Life shares would be an expensive option for Kun-hee and Jay Lee. It would be simpler, and cheaper, to have Everland sell its Samsung Life stake to other group entities so the family remains the top shareholder of Samsung Life, maintaining their ownership structure, analysts say. Samsung declined to comment on the litigation, which is a personal, civil case. Kun-hee has hired three of the country's biggest law firms to defend him. FAMILY FRICTION Lee Maeng-hee was chosen to lead Samsung in 1967 when his father retired, but his aggressive management style caused friction with the founder's confidants, according to several books about Samsung. Ties were finally severed after a coup by the founder's second son, Chang-hee, who told the presidential office his father had a $1 million slush fund overseas. Lee Byung-chull believed his eldest son was also involved in the plot to discredit him. He exiled Chang-hee to the United States, and returned as chairman himself. In 1976, when diagnosed with cancer, he decided Kun-hee should take over the business. Chang-hee died in 1991. In a recent book on Maeng-hee, ""Prince Sado of Samsung"", Lee Yong-u, no relation, wrote that Maeng-hee failed in his succession bid due to a conspiracy by the founder's inner circle, which included Kun-hee's father-in-law. ""My brother (Maeng-hee) had his own personality and the chairman had in his mind his successor should have a certain set of qualifications. I was able to become his successor partly because I am his son, but if I didn't have the qualifications he had in his mind, I wouldn't be able to make it,"" Kun-hee was quoted as saying in a 2010 book, ""The Lee Kun-hee story"". PUBLIC ANGER As and when Jay Lee takes over, there is likely to be closer public scrutiny amid growing anger over chaebols' dominance in an economy where wealth gaps are widening. ""It's not clear whether the share transfer scheme to Jay Lee will be clawed back by the courts at this point, from a legal purview,"" said Ewha's Kim. Jay Lee, 43, has yet to make any significant mark on the business, beyond a failed e-commerce venture during the dotcom bubble. Critics say he lacks his father's charisma, business insight and entrepreneurship. The snappily dressed and bespectacled Lee has a degree in East Asian history from Seoul National University, an MBA from Keio University in Japan and also attended the doctoral programme at Harvard Business School. He has two children and went through one of Korea's highest profile divorce cases. The Lee family has long been under attack by activist shareholders over its obscure share dealings. ""Right now, the reason why Korean stocks tend to sell at a discount is because of this problem (of limiting the say of minority shareholders). I'd say that's the single most important factor,"" said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group. Longer term, there is a risk that a focus on keeping it in the family may damage Samsung Group. ""The current Samsung Group transfer of power dynamics resembles the Roman Empire at or near its peak,"" said Ewha's Kim. ""What history has shown us is that what brought down the Pax Romana dynasty was over-expansion and over-spending. In this sense, history could very well repeat itself with the iconic Samsung corporate dynasty - its areas are simply too stretched and its resources spent too far away from its traditional areas of core competencies.""

201205,TEXT-S&P summary: Nokia Corp.,"S&P base-case operating scenario In our base-case assessment for 2012, we expect the group's consolidated revenues to decline by 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin to be close to breakeven. We believe that revenues from the Devices and Services division could decline in 2012 by the same extent as in 2011 (minus 18%) after Nokia reported first quarter 2012 revenues below our expectations, particularly for Symbian-based smartphones. We still expect revenue from Lumia smartphones to grow over time but not sufficiently to stabilize revenues in the smartphone division in the near term. Nokia's share of the global smartphone market fell to 8% in the first quarter of 2012 (from 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011 according to market research company Strategy Analytics) and we believe it could decline further in the near term. However, smartphone revenues could start rising by the end of 2012, and contribute to a stabilization of revenues in the Devices and Services division toward the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013 because Lumia devices are higher-priced. Our anticipation of lower revenues in 2012 also reflects the recently weak sales in Nokia's mobile phone division, which fell by 32% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2012. Nokia's strong position in this market could also weaken, especially in China and India, where demand has been significant for low-price smartphone-like devices. We understand that Nokia could accelerate and deepen the ongoing restructuring of the Devices and Services division. However, we do not believe that this will offset declining revenues in the near term and we expect non-IFRS operating margins for the division to be slightly negative in 2012, compared with positive 7% in 2011. S&P base-case cash flow and capital-structure scenario In our base-case assessment for 2012, we expect consolidated FOCF of minus EUR1 billion. We continue to view Nokia's cash position as a positive rating factor but we expect net cash to fall to EUR3.5 billion-EUR4.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2012, from EUR4.9 billion at March 31, 2012. This anticipated sharp decline includes a dividend payment of EUR740 million in May 2012. Liquidity The short-term rating is 'B', reflecting our long-term corporate credit rating and our liquidity assessment as ""strong"" according to our criteria. In our opinion, the group's strong liquidity can more than cover its needs over the near term, even if EBITDA were to decline sharply for a limited period or if NSN were unable to draw on a EUR2.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF). The group has good relationships with its banks, in our view. Nokia's main liquidity sources are as follows: -- Assumed consolidated surplus cash of about EUR5 billion over the next two years. As of March 31, 2012, the group's liquid assets totaled EUR9.8 billion. This figure includes cash on hand of EUR1.8 billion and short-term marketable securities of EUR8 billion. -- An undrawn committed RCF of EUR1.5 billion maturing in March 2016 with no financial covenants. -- NSN's EUR2.0 billion RCF, maturing in June 2012. We understand that NSN has already entered agreements to refinance this RCF with a EUR1.5 billion facility in two equal tranches maturing in June 2013 and June 2015. NSN's existing and new facilities contain maintenance financial covenants. Following a recent EUR1 billion capital injection from Siemens AG (A+/Positive/A-1+) and Nokia, we believe that headroom under NSN's covenants should be adequate over the next few quarters. Against these sources, we anticipate the following liquidity uses: -- Negative group FOCF of EUR1 billion in 2012, including cash restructuring outlays relating to NSN and the Devices and Services division. -- Debt amortization of EUR1 billion in the next 12 months, which primarily relates to already refinanced debt maturities at NSN, and a lack of other debt maturities before 2014. -- Dividends of EUR740 million in 2012. Recovery analysis The senior unsecured notes issued by Nokia are rated 'BB+,' in line with the corporate credit rating. The recovery rating on these instruments is '3' indicating our expectation of meaningful (50%-70%) recovery prospects for debtholders in an event of payment default. In line with our recovery criteria, the recovery ratings on unsecured debt issued by corporate entities with a corporate credit rating of 'BB-' or higher are generally capped at '3' to account for the possibility that their recovery prospects are at greater risk of being impaired by the issuance of additional priority or pari passu debt prior to default. To determine recoveries we simulate a hypothetical default scenario, in which a payment default occurs in 2019, triggered by an inability to refinance notes maturing in that year. In our view, this would most likely be due to a continued decline in revenues and market share and an inability to reduce costs coupled with continuous significant use of cash balances to invest in new technologies that do not improve operating performance. At this point, we envisage annual EBITDA to have declined to about EUR690 million. Our stressed enterprise valuation at our hypothetical point of default in 2019 is EUR2.76 billion, equivalent to a stressed EBITDA multiple of 4.0x. After deducting priority liabilities of EUR250 million, which mainly comprise enforcement costs and 50% of the group's pension liabilities. We see about EUR2.5 billion remaining for unsecured debtholders. We envisage about EUR5 billion of debt outstanding at default (including six months pre-petition interest), assuming that debt maturing in 2014 is refinanced, and the EUR1.5 billion RCF remains in place and is fully drawn at default. In calculating Nokia's stressed enterprise value, we exclude NSN, which we view as a stand-alone entity with its own financing arrangements with no guarantees from Nokia. We also exclude debt relating to NSN in our post-default waterfall. If value were to be obtained from NSN at our hypothetical point of default, it might enhance recovery prospects but would be unlikely to have an impact on the recovery rating which is capped at '3' due to the unsecured nature of the notes. Outlook The negative outlook reflects the possibility of a downgrade in the next 12 months if we see that the non-IFRS operating margin in the Devices and Services division remains at or below break even, or if consolidated FOCF remains negative, as this would further reduce Nokia's net cash position. This could be the case if revenues from Lumia smartphones do not increase significantly toward the end of 2012 as we currently expect, or if margins deteriorate further due to competitive pressure. We could revise the outlook to stable if revenues in the Devices and Services division stabilize, cash burn declines significantly, and non-IFRS operating margins return to at least mid-single-digit percentage levels.

201205,"UPDATE 4-Opera seen a Facebook fit but no ""For Sale"" sign","* Analysts say it would take over $1 bln to buy Opera * Company open to offer at the right price -bankers * Top shareholder: Not aware of any talks (Adds background) By Joachim Dagenborg and Balazs Koranyi OSLO, May 29 (Reuters) - Facebook is under pressure to make money from the increasing number of users who access the social networking site from mobiles, making Norway's Opera a good fit for it, bankers familiar with the technology industry said. Shares in the mobile browser maker soared by as much as 26 percent on Tuesday. Tech blogs reported recently that it was in the sights of Facebook, which was criticised at the time of its $100 billion initial public offering for failing to have an effective mobile advertising strategy. Opera's Internet browser optimises surfing on mobiles, which can be a slow and painful experience especially on more basic phones, and is especially popular in emerging markets. Bankers said the company had long been up for sale informally but they ruled out rival interest from the likes of Google and Yahoo in the short term. ""The company has been available for a long time. Informally it is for sale,"" one of the bankers said. ""And Facebook wants to buy its way into the emerging markets."" Another source familiar with the matter said it was unclear whether interest from third parties would ultimately result in closer partnerships or an outright takeover of Opera. ""Opera is attracting growing interest as mobile becomes more strategic for Internet companies, but there is no 'For Sale' sign up over the company,"" the source said. Opera currently benefits from partnerships with multiple companies including Google, which would be threatened by a takeover from a powerful rival such as Facebook. ""It's a classic challenge for a company like this. They're like the Switzerland of mobile. Someone would have to derive meaningful value to take them off of that independent path,"" the sources said. Facebook shares slid to a new low on Tuesday at just above $30, extending a losing streak since its controversial and glitch-ridden market debut on May 18. Facebook is approaching saturation point in the developed world and says its next billion users will come from countries such as India and Nigeria. Because many people in those markets own simple phones and do not have access to app stores, it is important for Facebook to make the experience of accessing the site through a Web browser as painless as possible. Its chief technology officer, Bret Taylor, said in February that Facebook would lend its weight to a push for better Web standards that would enable more apps to be delivered via a simple Internet browser, instead of going through Apple and Google stores. ""On paper (a Facebook-Opera combination) is a good story. Opera's browser is used in feature phones, not smartphones, mainly in the emerging markets,"" a second banker said. Opera, which has about 200 million subscribers to its Mobile and Mini services, has built a significant share in major emerging markets such as India and Brazil, which are strategic growth markets for Facebook. HEFTY PREMIUM The Norwegian company would be such a perfect fit for Facebook that the U.S. company would have to pay a hefty premium, analysts said. DNB, Norway's top bank, said the price would have to be double Friday's closing level, or 68.6 crowns, valuing Opera at $1.35 billion. Danske Bank and ABG Sundal Collier both predicted a price between 50 and 60 crowns a share, or $1 billion to $1.2 billion. ""Opera would be sensible for Facebook on several levels,"" Arctic Securities said. ""It would enhance the now limited mobile experience of Facebook, improve Facebook's mobile monetization problem, help Facebook retain online game developers leaving the social network over the lack of a mobile platform and further improve Facebook's ability to target ads."" Opera makes various Web browsers that work across an array of platforms including mobile phones, tablets, PCs and TVs. The software is available on most phones, including Apple's iPhone and Research in Motion's BlackBerry, and works on various operating systems, including Google's Android, giving Opera the reach Facebook is seeking. The browser can compress data by as much as 90 percent, saving consumers on data charges, and has the technology to better display ads, a significant factor for Facebook which has struggled to convert its rapidly increasing traffic from mobile platforms to revenue. Opera officials have repeatedly declined to comment. However, Chief Executive Lars Boilesen last October said he would ""love to"" further cooperate with Facebook. ""We are already Facebook's platform of distribution in emerging markets like Africa and India. A big part of the Opera Mini traffic is from Facebook. So we are already their channel in these markets,"" he said in October. ""We would love to cooperate with Facebook, but the same goes for Google and everyone else. There are no limits here, because we are the leading mobile client in these markets,"" he added. OBSTACLES Still, several obstacles remain. Opera's founder and top shareholder, Jon S. Von Tetzchner, said the firm should focus on organic growth. ""I want Opera to focus on growth and delivering good results; there are big opportunities for Opera,"" Tetzchner, who holds 10.9 percent of Opera, told Reuters. ""We have been promised 500 million users by 2013, and I think that's a good goal and the firm should keep going for it."" He added, ""I personally think that an ARPU (average revenue per user) goal of $1 is even modest. I am not pushing for a takeover."" Tetzchner said he was not aware of a bid and had not decided how he would react to one but that it would be, as he described it, ""undemocratic"" to try to block it if others supported it. Another obstacle could be Google, which has extensive relationships with Opera. ""A takeover by Facebook will likely send cold water down Google's spine,"" Arctic Securities said. Google is Opera's default search partner for Opera Mini and Opera Mobile worldwide outside Russia/CIS, making the firm a major relationship for Google.

201205,A look at BlackBerry and its maker in recent months as it faces heavy competition,"Research In Motion Ltd., the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry, warned Tuesday of an operating loss and layoffs to come as the company struggles to regain market share lost to Apple's iPhone and phones running Google's Android system. Here's a look at recent developments: Sept. 15, 2011: RIM reports a sharp drop in net income and revenue in the fiscal second quarter and says it has sold far fewer PlayBook tablet computers than it expected. Oct. 10: Email and Internet services are disrupted for three days, primarily outside North America. RIM says a crucial link in its infrastructure had failed, and a backup didn't work either. By the third day, other users, including those in the U.S. and Canada, were affected by a backlog of traffic. Oct. 25: RIM says it is delaying the launch of an upgraded operating system for the PlayBook until February, saying it isn't up to its standards yet. The company also says the new version initially won't have the popular messaging service BlackBerry Messenger. It's the third delay announced since the features were promised in April. Dec. 2: RIM says it is writing off much of its inventory of PlayBook tablets after it had to sell them at a deep discount. The model originally priced at $500 now costs $200. The company says it's taking a pre-tax charge of $485 million in the just-ended quarter. RIM also says it will sell fewer BlackBerrys in the holiday quarter than in the one that just ended. It also says it won't meet full-year earnings guidance of $5.25 to $6 per share, the third cut in a row. Dec. 6: RIM says ""BlackBerry 10"" will be the new name for its next-generation system after the company loses a trademark ruling on its previous name, BBX. Dec. 15: RIM says new phones deemed critical to the company's future won't be out until late 2012. The company says the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a highly integrated chipset that won't be available until mid-2012, so the company can now expect the new phones to ship late in the year. The company also says BlackBerry sales will fall sharply in the holiday quarter compared with the three months that ended Nov. 26. RIM says it would only ship between 11 million and 12 million BlackBerrys in the fourth quarter, down from 14.1 million in the third quarter. Jan. 22, 2012: RIM founder Mike Lazaridis and long-time executive Jim Balsillie announce they will step down as co-CEOs. Thorsten Heins, a chief operating officer who joined RIM four years ago from Siemens AG, was named as their replacement. Lazaridis and Balsillie remain on the board. Feb. 21: RIM finally releases an upgraded operating system for its PlayBook. The free upgrade allows for built-in email, calendar and contacts on the tablet -- features promised within 60 days after the PlayBook's launch last April. The PlayBook had received negative reviews because it launched without an email program and the popular messaging service BlackBerry Messenger. The new version still doesn't include the messaging service. March 29: RIM says Balsillie has resigned from its board, and two top executives are leaving. RIM also writes down the value of its product inventory again as the company reports a loss of $125 million, its first quarterly loss since fiscal 2005. Heins doesn't rule out a sale, but he says it is not the main direction of the strategic review he's overseeing. April 26: Newest board member of RIM says a turnaround could take three to five years. Prem Watsa, RIM's third-largest investor, says he sees his investment in the company as a long-term one, adding that RIM's fortunes won't be reversed soon. May 1: RIM unveils a newly designed smartphone prototype powered by its upcoming BlackBerry 10 system. The prototype BlackBerry has a touchscreen, but no physical keyboard like most BlackBerry models. No update was given on the new system's launch date. May 2: Company stresses that while the prototype has no physical keyboard, RIM will continue to make some models with one. May 8: RIM announces hiring of two senior executives from struggling tech companies. Frank Boulben, the new chief marketing officer, comes from LightSquared. Kristian Tear, the new chief operating officer, is from Sony Mobile Communications. Tuesday: RIM says it will have an operating loss in the current quarter and significant layoffs this year. The company says it has hired J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets to help evaluate various strategies, including opportunities to partner with other companies and license software. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Business Highlights,"------ Americans grew gloomier about the economy in May NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans grew much gloomier about the economy in May, causing a private group's measure of consumer confidence to fall the most it has in eight months. Worries about jobs, housing and the stock market rattled consumers, even though gas prices are falling. The latest figures suggest Americans will need to see more encouraging economic signs before their worry starts to dissipate. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 64.9 from a revised 68.7 in April. Analysts had expected the index to climb to 70. ------ Europeans ambivalent about euro, survey finds LONDON (AP) -- The debt crisis that has ravaged Europe for the best part of three years has exposed a dislike of the single currency but little desire to abandon it, a wide-ranging survey of public opinion found Tuesday. Pew Research Center's survey across eight European Union countries, including five members of the 17-country eurozone, indicated that the region's financial problems have triggered full-blown fears about the future of Europe as a political project. In Greece, the epicenter of the debt crisis, 71 percent of those polled want to keep the euro, compared with 23 percent who want to return to the drachma. Most people surveyed in Greece, which is now in its fifth year of a savage recession, think the euro has been good for them -- 46 percent, compared with 26 percent who thought the euro was a bad thing. ------ Iran, other Mideast states hit by computer virus LONDON (AP) -- Iran and other Middle East countries have been hit with a cunning computer virus that can eavesdrop on computer users and their co-workers and filch information from nearby cellphones, cybersecurity experts said Tuesday. Suspicion immediately fell on Israel as the culprit. The Russian Internet security firm Kaspersky Lab ZAO said the ""Flame"" virus is unprecedented in size and complexity. Researcher Roel Schouwenberg marveled at its versatility. Computers in Iran appear to have been particularly affected, and Kaspersky's conclusion that the virus was crafted at the behest of a national government fueled speculation it could be part of an Israeli-backed campaign of electronic sabotage against the Jewish state's archenemy. ------ RIM hires JP Morgan, RBC to review business TORONTO (AP) -- Struggling BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion says it has hired J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets to advise it and says there will be significant layoffs this year. RIM said in a release Tuesday that the advisers have been tasked to evaluate various strategies, including opportunities to partner and license. RIM made no mention of a sale of the company, but new Chief Executive Thorsten Heins did not rule out the idea after RIM's last earnings were released in late March. RIM also says it expects to report an operating loss for the first quarter. ------ Home prices rise in most major US cities WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home prices rose in March from February in most major U.S. cities for the first time in seven months. The increase is the latest evidence of a slow recovery taking shape in the housing market. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index shows that prices rose in 12 of the 20 cities it tracks. Three of the weakest markets showed signs of improvement. Prices rose in Tampa and Miami. They were unchanged in Las Vegas. ------ Facebook's stock falls below $30 for first time NEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook's stock has fallen below $30 for the first time since its much-awaited public debut this month. The stock fell $3.07, or 9.6 percent, to close at $28.84 on Tuesday. That's 24 percent below its debut price as a public stock. It went as low as $28.65 earlier in the day. Facebook Inc. began trading publicly on May 18 following one of the most anticipated stock offerings in history. ------ Dairies pamper cows to improve production CHILTON, Wis. (AP) -- Lucky, a 7-year-old dairy cow, had been walking with a limp for several weeks when veterinarian Sara Gilbertson was called. Instead of prescribing painkillers, Gilbertson tried an unusual new therapy -- a chiropractic adjustment that included a full-length spinal massage. Gilbertson rubbed the Holstein's spine by gently squeezing it from neck to tail, pausing to apply firm pressure to one hip and readjust several vertebrae. The cow stood in calm silence, moving only enough to reach another mouthful of hay. Later, as Lucky reclined on a bed of sand, Gilbertson noted with satisfaction how relaxed and comfortable the animal seemed. Cow comfort has become a key concern for the nation's farmers, who have known for generations that contented cows give more milk. The traditional techniques for keeping cows happy aren't complicated -- feed them well, keep the temperature comfortable and give them room to move around. But some dairy farmers are turning to a new array of creative options intended to keep cows as mellow -- and productive -- as possible. ------ Sprint to shut Nextel as early as June 2013 NEW YORK (AP) -- Sprint Nextel Corp. on Tuesday said it will shut down the Nextel network as early as June 30 next year, cutting off service for its walkie-talkie-like Nextel phones. Sprint had already said the shutdown would commence next year but had not set a date. The Overland Park, Kan., phone company bought the Nextel network in 2005 and has lost money every quarter for the last four years as it's struggled with the cost of running two incompatible wireless networks. There were 5.4 million phones active on the Nextel network at the end of March. Many Nextel customers are businesses or government agencies that issue the phones to construction crews and other mobile workers. Sprint now faces the challenge of convincing these customers to move to the Sprint network rather than competing carriers. As part of the pitch, Sprint has added phones with a walkie-talkie-like ""push-to-talk"" feature. ------ Google, Samsung unveil new version of Chromebook SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Google will try to win more converts to a computer operating system revolving around its popular Chrome Web browser with a new wave of lightweight laptops built by Samsung Electronics. Tuesday's release of the next-generation Chromebooks will give Google and Samsung another opportunity to persuade consumers and businesses to buy an unconventional computer instead of machines running on familiar software by industry pioneers Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. Unlike most computers, Google's Chromebooks don't have a hard drive. They function like terminals dependent on an Internet connection. The laptops come with 16 gigabytes of flash memory -- the kind found in smartphones, tablet computers and some iPods. Two USB ports allow external hard drives and other devices to be plugged into the machines. ------ Record drop in retail sales adds to Spain's woes MADRID (AP) -- A record drop in retail sales added to Spain's economic woes on Tuesday as the government struggled to boost confidence in the crippled banking industry and investors remained doubtful of the country's ability to manage its debts during a recession. April retail sales dropped 9.8 percent from a year earlier as the country battled its second recession in three years and a 24.4 percent jobless rate that is expected to rise. It was the 22nd straight monthly decline and more than double the 3.8 percent drop posted for March, the National Statistics Institute announced. A gloomy Bank of Spain report heaped more bad news on the government. The central bank predicted the economy will keep shrinking at least through June, after contracting 0.3 percent in the first quarter. The government has predicted a 1.7 percent contraction for the whole of 2012. ------ By The Associated Press(equals) The Dow Jones industrial average rose 125.86 points, or 1 percent, to close at 12,580.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed up 14.60 points at 1,332.42, and the Nasdaq composite added 33.46 points to 2,870.99. Benchmark U.S. crude ended the day down 10 cents at $90.76 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, which helps set the price for oil imported into the U.S., lost 43 cents to finish at $106.68 per barrel in London. In other futures trading, natural gas lost 13.9 cents to end at $2.429 per 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas has lost about 22 cents in the past two trading sessions. Heating oil lost 2 cents to finish at $2.8088 per gallon, while wholesale gasoline added 1.36 cents to finish at $2.9065 per gallon. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,RIM warns of operating loss and says there will be significant layoffs,"TORONTO (AP) - Struggling BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion warned Tuesday that it will have an operating loss in its current March-June quarter and said there will be significant layoffs this year. RIM also said in a release that it has hired J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets to help the company evaluate various strategies, including opportunities to partner with other companies and license software as well as other alternatives. Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM made no mention of a sale of the company but new chief executive Thorsten Heins did not rule it out after RIM's last earnings were released in late March. ""It's a disaster, it's bad,"" Jefferies analyst Peter Misek said. ""The problem is you can't see a path to a sale until you stabilize the business."" Misek said if the advisers weren't brought in to consider a sale originally they are likely considering it now. Misek expects RIM to announce as many as 5,000 layoffs soon. RIM's stock was halted in after-hours trading Tuesday. When trading resumed shares fell more than 10 percent, or $1.20, to $10.03. The once-iconic RIM, the company that pioneered the smartphone market with its Blackberry phones, is facing the most difficult period in its history. RIM's U.S. share of smartphones dropped from 44 percent in 2009 to 10 percent in 2011, according to market researcher NPD Group. The company still has 78 million active subscribers across the globe, but Apple and Android phone makers such as Samsung and HTC are taking market share. The company is working on the launch of a new software operating system, but that's happening just as North Americans are abandoning their BlackBerry's for flashier and more versatile smartphones like Apple's iPhone and phones that run Google's Android software. ""The on-going competitive environment is impacting our business in the form of lower volumes and highly competitive pricing dynamics in the marketplace, and we expect our (current quarter's) results to reflect this, and likely result in an operating loss for the quarter,"" new chief executive Thorsten Heins said. Heins, formerly a little known chief operating officer at RIM, took over in January after RIM founder Mike Lazaridis and longtime executive Jim Balsillie stepped down as Co-CEOs after the company lost tens of billions in market value. RIM said there will be staff reductions among its 16,500 employees and significant spending cuts as the company looks to save a $1 billion -- even as it transitions to its much-delayed ""BlackBerry 10"" software platform expected out later this year. RIM reiterated that its financial performance will continue to be challenged for the next few quarters. Misek believes that had BlackBerry 10 been released last year, the company might have had a chance, but he said now RIM is likely to release the new BlackBerrys right when Apple is due to introduce a new iPhone. Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Financial, called it a downward slide that's not going to get any better. Gillis said he doesn't see any buyers for RIM coming forward soon. Gillis said the advisers are likely presenting a number of options, including a sale, split up of the software and hardware business or a continued attempt to turn the company round. Gillis said RIM could license something like its popular BlackBerry messenger service. ""Unfortunately, it falls into the too little, too late category,"" Gillis said. ""It doesn't mean somebody won't try it. It doesn't mean it's going to be a savior for the company either."" Gillis believes RIM is fighting against some of the best talent in the world in Google, Apple and Samsung in a fast-moving marketplace. ""They were the leader and this is what happens in the technology cycle of creation and destruction. They rode the first wave of the smartphone revolution and Apple is riding the next one,"" Gillis said. BlackBerrys lag iPhones and Android phones when it comes to third-party applications or ""apps,"" small software programs that perform one or two tasks like editing mobile photos or displaying sports scores. The iPhone's popularity has continued to skyrocket as Apple has developed a vast ecosystem of apps. Now, RIM must persuade developers that it's worth their time and effort to make apps for the BlackBerry 10 platform. RIM has tried to make showier phones with touchscreens that resemble the iPhone's, but those offerings have largely flopped. And so has RIM's tablet, the PlayBook, which uses the very software that will be in the new BlackBerry 10 smartphones. RIM is following the same trajectory as struggling Finnish handset makers Nokia and California-based Palm, both of which attracted consumers with trend-setting phones and technologies in their heyday, only to be outmaneuvered by competitors. In Canada, there is fear that the nation's biggest technology company could go the way of former Canadian tech giant Nortel, which declared bankruptcy in 2009 and was picked over for its patents. ""It is a very bad situation for Canada, primarily because this was the national champion,"" Misek said. ""What this illustrates is you have to be globally competitive and you've got to remain globally competitive."" 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Google tries to win more converts to Chrome operating system with new laptops from Samsung tries to win more converts to Chrome operating system with new laptops from,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google will try to win more converts to a computer operating system revolving around its popular Chrome Web browser with a new wave of lightweight laptops built by Samsung Electronics. Tuesday's release of the next-generation Chromebooks will give Google and Samsung another opportunity to persuade consumers and businesses to buy an unconventional computer instead of machines running on familiar software by industry pioneers Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. Unlike most computers, Google's Chromebooks don't have a hard drive. They function like terminals dependent on an Internet connection. The laptops come with 16 gigabytes of flash memory -- the kind found in smartphones, tablet computers and some iPods. Two USB ports allow external hard drives and other devices to be plugged into the machines. Chromebooks haven't made much of a dent in the market since their debut a year ago. In that time, more people have been embracing Apple's iPad and other tablet computers -- a factor that has contributed to a slowdown in sales of personal computers. The cool reception to Chromebooks has raised questions about whether Google misjudged the demand for computers designed to quickly connect to its dominant Internet search engine and ever-expanding stable of other online services, ranging from email to a recently introduced file-storage system called Drive. ""The Chromebooks have had less to offer than tablets, so they haven't been that interesting to consumers,"" said Gartner analyst Mika Kitagawa. Google says it always intended to take things slowly with the Chromebooks to give its engineers time to understand the shortcomings of the machines and make the necessary improvements. ""This release is a big step in the journey to bringing (Chromebooks) to the mainstream,"" said Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Chrome and apps. The upgraded laptop, called ""Series 5 550,"" is supposed to run two-and-half times faster than the original machines, and boasts higher-definition video. Google also added features that will enable users to edit documents offline, read more content created in widely used Microsoft applications such as Word and Excel, and retrieve material from another computer at home or an office. More emphasis is being placed on Chrome's Web store, which features more than 50,000 applications. The price: $449 for models that only connect to the Internet through Wi-Fi and $549 for a machine that connects on a 3G network. Samsung's original Chromebooks started out with prices ranging from $429 to $499. Like the original Chromebooks, the next-generation machines feature a 12.1-inch screen display and run on an Intel processor. Google Inc. and Samsung also are introducing a ""Chromebox"" that can be plugged into a display monitor to create the equivalent of desktop computer. The box will sell for $329. The latest Chromebook and new Chromebox will be available online only, beginning in the U.S. on Tuesday, followed by a Wednesday release in the United Kingdom. The products will go on sale in brick-and-mortar stores for the first time in still-to-be-determined Best Buy locations next month. The expansion beyond Internet-only sales signals Google's determination to attract a mass audience to its Chromebooks, just as it's done with smartphones running on its Android software. More than 300 million mobile devices have been activated on Android since the software's 2008 release. Without providing specifics, Pichai said several other computer manufacturers will release Chromebooks later this year. Google plans to back the expanded line of Chromebooks with a marketing blitz during the holiday shopping season in November and December. One reason Google is confident Chromebooks will eventually catch on is because the Chrome Web browser has attracted so many fans in less than four years on the market. The company says more than 200 million people worldwide currently are using the Chrome browser. Like other laptop and desktop computers, the Chromebooks will have to contend with the accelerating shift to the iPad and other tablets. The iPad 2, an older version of Apple's tablet line, sells for as little as $399, undercutting the new Chromebook. Other low-cost tablets are expected to hit the market later this year. One of them might even be made by Motorola Mobility, a device maker that Google bought for $12.5 billion earlier this month. Google so far hasn't commented on Motorola's future plans for the tablet market. The new Chromebooks also are hitting the market at a time when some prospective computer buyers may be delaying purchases until they can check out machines running on Windows 8, a makeover of Microsoft's operating system that is expected to be released in September or October. Microsoft designed Windows 8 so it can be controlled through touch as well as keyboards. That versatility is expected to inspire the creation of hybrid machines that are part laptop, part tablet. Google shares added $2.81 Tuesday to close at $594.34. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,"A look at how selected chipmakers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: April 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC estimate that PC shipments in the first quarter were ahead of their expectations, though growth was modest in light of competition from smartphones and tablet computers. Hewlett-Packard Co. appeared to have regained some of the business it had lost as it was weighing whether to dump its PC business. Lenovo Group Ltd. showed strong gains over last year. Dell Inc.'s market share fell as it focused on higher-end, higher-profit machines. April 17: IBM Corp. reports flat revenue, falling short of analysts' expectations. Software and services revenue grew, but IBM's hardware and financing segments saw a decline. Intel Corp. reports first-quarter results that were held back by a shortage of hard drives, which meant that PC makers had to curb production and needed fewer Intel chips. The scarcity was caused by flooding of hard-drive factories in Thailand last year. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology PLC reports that its earnings in the latest quarter surged and revenue almost doubled. CEO Steve Luczo says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. But Seagate says it also shifted its product line to ""industry-leading products"" across all of its markets. April 18: Strong demand boosted revenue at Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs says the company benefited from growing global demand for new 3G- and 4G-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. But he says the cost of making more 28 nanometer chips could cut into profit margins in upcoming months. April 19: Microsoft Corp. reports a surprise rise in sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers. Analysts had assumed that many businesses and consumers thinking about buying a PC would hold off until Windows 8 hits the market in the fall. That didn't turn out to be the case as revenue in the Windows division increased 4 percent in the latest quarter. EMC Corp., one of the world's largest makers of data-storage computers, says first-quarter earnings jumped 23 percent, boosted by increased demand for its cloud computing products. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. says its computing solutions unit had flat revenue, while the graphics segment saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue because of lower demand for desktop and mobile graphics. SanDisk Corp., a maker of flash memory, says quarterly earnings sank by almost half amid weak demand and low selling prices -- trends the company expects will continue in the current quarter. The company says it expects demand to rise, but not until the second half of 2012. Altera Corp., a semiconductor maker, reports weak results it attributes to lighter-than-expected demand for its products, particularly from customers in the communications industry. In addition, the company said it had some issues trying to fill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. The company expects its business to rebound in the second quarter and says its backlog has significantly improved since the end of the quarter on stronger demand for its products. April 23: Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. says the business cycle ""bottomed"" in the first quarter. Orders rose 13 percent. CEO Rich Templeton says 2012 will be ""a good year for growth."" Xerox Corp. says revenue from its services business grew, while technology revenue, such as sales of document systems and supplies, declined. Services now make up more than half the company's revenue. April 24: Apple Inc.'s Mac sales for the quarter came in slightly below expectations, at 4 million. But Apple once again reported blowout iPhone sales, along with iPad sales that were two and a half times what it sold a year earlier. The relative strength of iPhone sales means they accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent. April 25: Business software maker SAP AG says net income rose 10 percent in the first quarter. It cited strong sales momentum for its high-speed HANA data platform and cloud-computing acquisition SuccessFactors. April 26: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which supplies chips under contract for other companies including Apple, predicts ""solid growth"" with stronger-than-anticipated demand for smartphones and tablet computers coming from the U.S. and China. Western Digital Corp., a leading maker of hard drives, says production is heading back up. That led to a drop in its stock price, as a bigger supply could lead to lower prices. CEO John Coyne says Western Digital and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods that hit factories in Thailand last year. They had led to industrywide shortages of hard drives. May 11: Nvidia Corp., which makes graphics chips and processors for PCs, tablets and other devices, reports quarterly results that beat expectations and gives strong revenue guidance for the current quarter. May 17: Salesforce.com Inc., a maker of Web-based business software, says it lost money in the first quarter, but adjusted profit and revenue beat expectations, and the company raised its forecast for full-year results. May 22: Dell Inc. says total product revenue fell 5 percent to $11.42 billion in the latest quarter as revenue from mobility products, software, desktop PCs, and storage products all decreased. Sales to consumers took a particularly sharp decline of 12 percent, while sales to the public sector fell 4 percent and revenue from large businesses decreased by 3 percent. Sales to small and medium businesses grew 4 percent. May 23: Hewlett-Packard Co. announces plans to cut 27,000 workers, or 8 percent of its work force, as the growing popularity of smartphones, the iPad and other mobile devices makes it tougher for the company to sell personal computers. Revenue in the PC division was flat as revenue from consumer products fell 4 percent, offset by a 3 percent increase in revenue from businesses. Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's second largest PC maker, says quarterly profit rose 59 percent on record sales. The company reported strong growth in Europe and North America despite economic problems there. For the fiscal year ending in March, global PC shipments rose 35 percent, while market share rose to a new high of 12.9 percent. Coming up: Not yet known: Oracle Corp.

201205,A look at how selected makers of phones and other consumer-electronic gadgets are faring,"A look at how selected makers of phones and other consumer-electronic gadgets are faring: April 19: Microsoft Corp. says it shipped 1.4 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first three months of the year, about half of the 2.7 million shipped a year earlier. Nokia Corp. says sales of smartphones dropped to 12 million in the first quarter, from 24 million a year earlier, while volume sales of cellphones fell to 83 million from 108 million a year earlier. April 24: Apple Inc. says it sold 35 million iPhones in the quarter, almost twice as many as it sold a year ago and above analyst expectations. IPad sales came in below analyst expectations, at 11.8 million units. But that was still two and a half times as many as it sold in the same quarter a year ago. Mac sales were also slightly below expectations, at 4 million. That was 7 percent more than a year ago. Apple sold 7.7 million iPods, down 15 percent from a year earlier. AT&T Inc. says it activated 4.3 million iPhones in the first quarter. That was down from 7.6 million in the fourth quarter, when AT&T began selling the iPhone 4S. However, the number was still up from the 3.6 million iPhones AT&T sold in the same quarter a year ago. HTC Corp. reports a drop in first-quarter earnings and revenue as it faces competition from Apple and Samsung, but it expects revenue to rise in the current quarter with its ""HTC One"" series phone that offers users a better camera and music experience in addition to a sleek design. HTC says its biggest challenges had been the iPhone 4S's launch late last year. It expects to win back some of the U.S. market and expand its markets in Europe and Asia. HTC doesn't disclose the number of devices it sold, citing competitive reasons. April 25: TomTom says it sold 1.4 million personal-navigation devices in North America, down from 2.1 million a year ago. In Europe, it sold 2 million, down from 2.4 million.

201205,Dow Jones industrial average posts a rare gain of nearly 125; Facebook flops again,"NEW YORK (AP) - The stock market is desperately looking for good news. On Tuesday, oil prices fell, the euro sank to a 22-month low, and the yield on the U.S. government's 10-year Treasury note fell near a historic low after a report suggested that Spain will have more trouble repaying its debts. But stocks rose anyway. In fact, they had one of their best days in an otherwise dreary month. Investors focused on hopes that China is poised to rev up its economic growth machine and that upcoming elections in Greece will help the country stay in the euro. ""The overriding news isn't that great,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at investment advisors Banyan Partners. ""But Greece and China are taking the pressure off the market in the short term."" Gains in industrial stocks that depend heavily on the Chinese economy, like Caterpillar and Alcoa, helped push the Dow Jones industrial average up 125.86 points. The Dow closed at 12,580.69, up 1 percent. China is the largest market for aluminum, which Alcoa makes, and Caterpillar recently said it is aggressively courting China to sell its construction equipment. Both stocks gained 3 percent. It was only the fifth gain for the Dow this month. The index is down 4.8 percent for May and is headed for its first monthly loss since September. The main culprits behind the decline have been the increasing likelihood that Greece will drop out of the euro currency and a worsening of Spain's financial condition. Facebook plunged 10 percent to $28.84, shaving $25 billion off from the company's market value in its first seven days of trading. The glitch-plagued IPO has drawn scrutiny from regulators and ire from disgruntled investors who had trouble executing trades. Blackberry maker Research in Motion plunged 11 percent in after-hours trading to $10 after the company said it expects to post a loss in its first quarter amid tough competition in the smartphone business. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed up 14.60 points at 1,332.42, and the Nasdaq composite added 33.46 points to 2,870.99. U.S. markets were closed Monday for Memorial Day. Oil prices fell below $91 after ratings agency Egan Jones downgraded Spain's debt Tuesday. Crude oil prices have been dropping steadily from $106 four weeks ago amid signs of slowing global growth. Analysts have been concerned that Spain and other weak European economies could drag the European Union into recession this year. It would lead to lower demand from Europe, a region that consumes 16 percent of the world's oil. It also could harm trading partners like the U.S. and China and slow down global demand for oil. The same worries flagged in the report sent the euro to $1.246, its lowest point against the dollar since July 2010. Investors fled to the safety of U.S. government bonds, sending the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury note as low as 1.71 percent, near an all-time low. Stock investors on Tuesday appeared relieved with news from Greece that a party in favor of abiding by the terms of the country's financial rescue could win in national elections next month. That could avoid a catastrophic rift with Greece's international creditors and keep the struggling country within the euro zone. There was also some positive news from the beleaguered U.S. housing market. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller report found that home prices increased in 12 of the 20 cities it tracks. The increase in March from the month before was the first in seven months. It was the latest evidence of a slow recovery taking shape in the troubled housing market. In Europe, concerns that Spain's ailing banking sector might worsen the European debt crisis sent the Spanish stock market to nine-year lows. Other European markets rose. Spain's banks are sitting on huge amounts of soured investments in the country's imploded real estate market. That has led to the recent nationalization of Bankia, the country's fourth-largest lender. Bankia revealed last week that it needs far more money in state aid than previously expected, $23.8 billion. Madrid's Ibex index fell 2.3 percent and Bankia dropped another 13.6 percent. Other stocks that were making big moves: -- Interline Brands shot up 40 percent after the maintenance company said it is being acquired by a pair of private equity groups for about $811 million. -- Patriot Coal rose 6 percent after the company said its CEO is leaving the company. Last week Patriot announced that it is working with private equity firm The Blackstone Group after there were concerns that the mining company could run short on cash. -- ConocoPhillips rose over 2 percent after a Citi analyst said the company is likely to pay hefty dividends this year thanks to asset sales that generated higher returns than analysts expected. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Samsung launches latest Galaxy smartphone in Europe before arrival of Apple's new iPhone,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Samsung Electronics Co., the world's largest maker of mobile phones, said its third-generation Galaxy S smartphone went on sale Tuesday in 28 European and Middle Eastern countries, hoping to cement its lead over Apple's iPhone. The Galaxy S III smartphones hit the shelves in countries including France and Britain. By the end of July, nearly 300 mobile operators around the world will be selling the device. Buyers of the new smartphone in five European countries will also be the first to get their hands on Samsung's music streaming service. In Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain, the Galaxy S III will be shipped with access to the Music Hub -- an iTune's like service allowing users to listen to music as well as buy and store it. Samsung said the service has a 19-million song catalog. Samsung said the initial response to the new smartphone was positive. At Vodafone Group, pre-sale orders for the Galaxy S III outstripped those of any previous Android-based smartphones, according to Samsung. The Galaxy series of smartphones is widely acknowledged in the industry as a success for Samsung, turning it from a smartphone also-ran into a viable competitor with the iPhone from Apple Inc. While Apple has kept the screen size of the iPhone the same in every upgrade since 2007, Samsung increased the screen size of its highest-end smartphone in its two major updates. The latest Galaxy phone screen is nearly twice as big as the iPhone screen. The 4.8-inch S III also features more computing power that supports voice commands and an eye-movement tracking feature to keep the screen from dimming. The music service, which is available in free and paid versions, can recommend new tunes based on a user's listening preferences. The paid service allows uploading and storage of music files on servers that can be accessed from more than one Internet-connected device at a cost of (EURO)9.99 per month, Samsung said. Unlike Apple, which uses its in-house operating system and iTunes music service, Samsung has relied on Google's Android operating system for its flagship smartphones. Samsung's music service is a result of its acquisition of mSpot Inc., a Palo Alto, California-based provider of music and movie streaming services on the Web and mobile devices. The Korean firm has been making efforts to increase homemade mobile content, such as its own messaging application, hoping that these features will boost consumer loyalty. Samsung overtook Apple in smartphone sales for the first time in the first three months of this year, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. The Suwon, South Korea-based company sold 44.5 million smartphones in the January-March quarter, compared with Apple's 35.1 million iPhone sales. Market watchers expect that Apple may use its annual conference for developers next month to announce the yearly upgrade to the iPhone, which then can go on sale as early as July. Aside from being big rivals in the smartphone market, Samsung and Apple have also a close business relationship. Samsung supplies mobile chips and display panels for iPhones and iPad tablet computers, counting Apple among its biggest clients. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,REFILE-UPDATE 3-Samsung Galaxy S3 gets head start on rival iPhone,"(Refiles to remove extraneous apostrophe in paragraph six) * Goes on sale in 28 countries on Tuesday * S3 has voice recognition, bigger screen than iPhone 4S * Queue overnight outside Berlin store * Samsung shares down 0.2 pct, lagging Seoul market By Miyoung Kim and Paul Sandle SEOUL/LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics launched its top-of-the-range Galaxy S3 smartphone in Europe on Tuesday, aiming to outsell its previous model that helped the South Korean company topple Apple as the world's largest smartphone maker. The Galaxy S3, which tracks the user's eye movements to keep the screen from dimming or turning off while in use, hits stores in 28 European and Middle East countries, including Germany, as Samsung aims to increase its lead over Apple months ahead of its new iPhone, expected in the third quarter. Samsung has tried to create the kind of frenzy around the launch that has become the norm for Apple's new gadgets. But some customers will have to wait a couple of weeks to get their phone because of delays in making it in a newly-invented ""Pebble Blue"" colour. In Berlin, about 50 customers queued outside the BASE mobile phone shop on Monday night eager to be the first to lay their hands on the S3. Also in Frankfurt some 100 people were in the queue this morning when the Deutsche Telekom shop on the city's busiest shopping street The Zeil opened. ""That's about the same as when the latest iPhone went on sale,"" said 21-year old Steven Barth, who was taking orders at the shop. ""I think our publicity campaign also helps. We are giving away about a hundred Galaxys today, in this shop."" Robert, a student from Frankfurt, who declined to give his last name as he should have been studying, said he had already ordered his Galaxy S3. ""I didn't really like it when Apple was selling the iPhone only via Deutsche Telekom. That's when I decided to buy a Samsung and never left,"" the 28-year old said. Other Frankfurt cellphone stores were not so busy. And in Paris, several cellphone stores did not have the S3 and sales assistants said they did not know when they would get it. ""Consumers have been waiting for the Galaxy S3. It's one of the few emblematic smartphone launches this year,"" said Laurent Lame, marketing director of devices for French operator SFR. He said Samsung was aiming for a similar buzz as with iPhone launches. ""Samsung has closely guarded the details of the phone to create a sense of secrets and confidentiality that then makes the launch into an event. They do 'teasing' like Apple does now,"" Lame said. A spokesman for Vodafone in Britain said the device had been the most pre-ordered Android device in its line-up ever. MASSIVE MARKETING The smartphone, running on Google's Android operating system, boasts a 4.8-inch (12.2 cm) screen, one of the largest on smartphones ever, and much bigger than the 3.5-inch display on the iPhone 4S. Top global carriers - from Britain's Vodafone to Singapore's SingTel - have started to promote the S3 aggressively, fuelling speculation the smartphone could top its predecessor, the Galaxy S2's 20 million sales worldwide. Samsung itself has said it expects the new flagship model to outsell its predecessor. Samsung introduced its first Galaxy in 2010, three years after the iPhone's debut, to counter Apple's roaring success in smartphones when the troubles of bigger rivals Nokia and BlackBerry maker Research In Motion had started. Samsung sold 44.5 million smartphones in January-March - equal to nearly 21,000 every hour - giving it 30.6 percent market share. Apple sold 35.1 million iPhones, taking 24.1 percent market share. ""The Galaxy S3 is a real challenger to the upcoming iPhone,"" said Francisco Jeronimo, an IDC analyst based in London. ""This is likely be one of the most sold smartphones this year, though the real test will come when the next iPhone is launched."" In the race for global smartphone supremacy, Apple has accused Samsung of copying some of its products. The South Korean company counter-claims that Apple has infringed its patents. Both have denied the allegations, and a long-running court saga continues. Apple plans to use a larger screen on the next iPhone, according to people familiar with the situation. The current iPhone 4S model was introduced last October. Samsung has launched its own music service on the Galaxy S3, putting itself head-to-head with Apple. It has previously rebranded existing music and video services. ""Samsung is not known for our content services; we make good hardware products but we haven't done much in the content space but that's changing,"" T.J. Kang, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics' Media Solution Center, said. ""We are doing it to create a better experience for our users. There are things we could do better if we have complete control over all of the service."" MORE ROUNDED In a departure from its predecessor, whose look and feel became the main subject of the legal dispute with Apple, the latest Galaxy has a more rounded outline. It also has voice recognition, dubbed S Voice, which will inevitably be compared with Apple's Siri, and image recognition software that can tag and share photographs. Prices vary depending on the contract. A model with 16 gigabytes of memory costs up to 189 pounds ($300) under a 12-month contract with Vodafone. A similar package for the iPhone 4s costs 159 pounds, but comes with a more expensive monthly data plan. Samsung said it will release the S3 via 296 carriers in 145 countries by July. Profit from Samsung's mobile division nearly tripled in January-March to $3.6 billion, accounting for 73 percent of operating profit. Analysts estimate its global marketing campaign for the S3 will likely have cost several hundred million dollars. Samsung - whose shares have gained 82 percent since late-August, beating Apple's 58 percent rise - is now banking on an aggressive marketing campaign ahead of the summer London Olympics to further drive sales. It has said its mobile market share in China doubled after the 2008 Beijing Olympics. ""The S3 is supported by an unprecedented promotional campaign,"" said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight in London. ""Samsung's timing with the Galaxy S3 is perfect.""

201205,PRESS DIGEST-Australian General News - May 29,"Compiled for Reuters by Media Monitors. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW (www.afr.com) Iain Ross, president of Fair Work Australia, yesterday suggested that the workplace arbiter legally separate its traditional industrial relations duties from its oversight of monitoring trade unions. Mr Ross, who appeared in front of a upper house committee yesterday, added that Fair Work Australia's reputation had been substantially lessened by the scandal surrounding the Health Services Union. Page 1. -- Harry Boon, former director of failed Hastie Group, yesterday slammed the decision by three of the engineering firm's seven lenders to not accept a write-down on their debt after the company had sourced two potential financial backers.

201205,UPDATE 2-RIM's top lawyer joins parade of resignations,"* Karima Bawa ran RIM's litigation, commercial agreements * Lawyer joins head of global sales in exiting RIM * Departures come as new CEO puts stamp on company * RIM plans make-or-break BlackBerry launch later in year * Shares rise slightly on Toronto Stock Exchange (Adds quotes from analyst, details) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 28 (Reuters) - The top lawyer at Research In Motion Ltd has resigned and will soon leave the struggling BlackBerry maker, RIM said on Monday, joining a parade of long-time company executives to depart since Thorsten Heins took over as CEO earlier this year. The loss of Chief Legal Officer Karima Bawa - who litigated numerous patent disputes and helped write many of RIM's commercial deals - follows the resignation of RIM's head of global sales, Patrick Spence, last week. [ID :nL1E8GOPR2] ""Thorsten Heins is reframing the RIM organization. Not everyone will fit into the new picture,"" said IDC analyst Kevin Restivo. ""Departures, forced or otherwise, are inevitable anytime management sets a new course for an organization."" The resignations come ahead of what are expected to be massive layoffs this year as the company prepares to launch BlackBerry smartphones run by an operating system completely different from that used in its legacy phones. RIM's shares have fallen some 75 percent in the last year while its market share has shriveled against competition from iPhone maker Apple Inc and a slew of manufacturers using Google Inc's Android operating system. RIM's Toronto-listed rose 0.9 percent to C$11.34 late Monday afternoon. The company's Nasdaq-listed shares < RIMM.O> were not trading due to a U.S. holiday. Bawa, who joined RIM in 2000, was promoted to general counsel and chief legal officer in late 2010. She plans to stay with the company while a replacement is hired and during a transition, R IM said in an emailed statement after Reuters asked about Bawa's status. Analysts and former employees have long complained about what they viewed as a hyper-cautious corporate approach at RIM. That grew out of a drawn-out patent dispute early in the company's rise and was exacerbated by the hiring of a slew of in-house lawyers afterwards. CLEANING HOUSE RIM is quietly cleaning out layers of management and recruiting f resh faces to fill important roles in a new structure being fashioned under Heins, who himself replaced longtime co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in January. ""Thorsten has a very different leadership style,"" said one former RIM employee who left several months ago. ""He is picking a very specific organizational structure, inner circle, external hires and strategy, and a lot of folks aren't 100 percent comfortable with it."" The former employee spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his ongoing business relationship with the company. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company currently employs around 16,500 people globally. Two sources with close connections to RIM have told Reuters that RIM plans to bring its workforce closer to 10,000 by early next year. The sources asked to go unidentified because their disclosures would hurt their relationships with RIM. The cuts will affect RIM's legal, marketing, sales, operations, and human resources divisions, one of the sources said. ""The Research In Motion people have come to know is very likely to be a much smaller organization in the near future,"" said IDC's Restivo. ""It's a reflection of the company's smartphone struggles. Call it an trailing indicator if you will."" RIM's share of the global smartphone market slipped to 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2012 from 13.6 percent a year earlier, according to IDC. A round of 2,000 job cuts was planned for around June 1, the day before the end of RIM's quarter, the Globe and Mail said on Saturday, citing several people close to the company. Last July RIM said it cut 2,000 jobs, after its worker count ballooned to near 20,000 following a string of acquisitions in recent years. Balsillie remains the departure with the highest profile. While cutting all formal ties to the company, he remains a major shareholder. Lazaridis is still influential on the board. A chief operating officer, Jim Rowan, and the head of software David Yach left in March. Soon after, Alan Brenner, a senior vice president for the BlackBerry platform, and Alistair Mitchell, vice president for the BlackBerry Messenger instant messaging product, also left. The head of RIM's India unit left in November, its head of government relations left months before that, and former chief marketing officer Keith Pardy departed more than a year ago. RIM said this month it had replaced Pardy with wireless veteran Frank Boulben, who has yet to start work. It has also named Kristian Tear as its single chief operating officer. He replaces Heins, who took the CEO job, Rowan, who departed, and a third operating head, Don Morrison, who retired last year.

201205,Green thumb app tells users when plants need watering,"TORONTO, May 28 (Reuters) - Wilted, starving, thirsty houseplants could soon be getting more tender loving care thanks to a new plant sensor and app that tells owners when it is time for watering and feeding. The Koubachi Wifi Plant Sensor, which is placed in the soil of the potted plant, connects with a smartphone app that alerts users when plants need watering, misting, fertilizer or more sun or shade. ""There's very little information when you buy a plant. Most of the time there's a little sticker that will say it needs a medium amount of light and water every few days. But that's very rough and doesn't apply for most plants,"" said Phillipp Bolliger, the inventor of the system and CEO of Koubachi AG, which is based in Zurich, Switzerland. The sensor collects data such as soil moisture, light intensity and ambient temperature, which is sent to the app, available for iOS devices and through the web. Bolliger said water monitoring is particularly important. ""The problem people run into most often is that they give too much water -- that's the main cause of killing plants,"" he explained in an interview. The data is used to customize care plans, delivered via the app, for more than 135 species of plants, including orchids, tomatoes and umbrella plants. The care plans were developed in conjunction with plant physiologists at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Institute of Technology. Bolliger said the plant care plans can be accessed through the app without purchasing a sensor, but they are more accurate when paired with it. ""We run different experiments with a lot of different plant types in the greenhouse,"" said Bolliger. ""We have our experts assess the vitality of the plant. Then we verify our models given the actual expert analysis of the plant's vitality."" He added that it is not necessary to purchase a sensor, which costs 100 euros ($125), for each plant because there is a multi-plant feature that allows the system to learn the specifics of the plant in a few weeks, depending on the size of the plant. It will have enough information to tailor the plant care plan and the sensor can then be used in a different plant. The sensor, which took about three years to develop, can run for more than a year on a single set of batteries, according to Bolliger. ""It kind of resembles a stone that is in the plant,"" he said. The app, which is free, is available worldwide from the App Store in English and German and there are plans for French and Japanese versions. The sensor is sold only online at store.koubachi.com. The company is planning to expand its distribution to local retailers in the United States and Canada.

201205,UPDATE 2-Canada's RIM to cut at least 2000 jobs- report,"* Article says major restructuring begins in next few weeks * Source tells Reuters job cuts could be much higher * BlackBerry maker had already slashed jobs in 2011 (Adds number of RIM employees globally, details on stock move) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 26 (Reuters) - Research In Motion Ltd is preparing for a major restructuring beginning in the next couple of weeks that will see it eliminate at least 2,000 jobs worldwide, the Globe and Mail reported on Saturday, citing unnamed sources. The Canadian newspaper, citing several people close to the company, reported that the next round is layoffs is said to be planned for around June 1 - a day before the BlackBerry smartphone maker's first quarter ends - but some expect the announcement even earlier. One source close to the company told Reuters the impending layoffs could hit as many as 6,000 people and affect RIM's legal, marketing, sales, operations, and human resources divisions. ""The strategic question is: are you accelerating into a better future or shrinking to a niche operation,"" said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the job cuts. A RIM spokeswoman contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the report. But she pointed to comments that new Chief Executive Thorsten Heins and Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka made on RIM's last earnings call about plans to streamline operations and save $1 billion in the fiscal year. The spokeswoman said RIM now has about 16,500 staff globally. This is down from a peak closer to 20,000. RIM reported a fourth-quarter loss in March, when the new CEO announced the initial steps in a strategic overhaul. Heins took over from longtime co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in January. Once the dominant player in the wireless e-mail sector, RIM has lost market share due to fierce competition from Apple Inc's iPhone and phones running on Google Inc's Android software. RIM has already been through one round of restructuring. Last July it announced plans to cut about 11 percent of its workforce, or 2,000 jobs. A string of high-level employees have departed RIM recently, including global head of sales Patrick Spence, who was set to take a senior job at audio company Sonos. Several sources close to the company told Reuters RIM had been letting more junior staff go for several months in what has come to be known internally as 'Goodbye Thursdays,' because the cuts typically occurred on that day of the week. The job cuts have failed to boost the company's stock. On Thursday RIM shares hit a multi-year low of C$10.87 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock changed hands for more than C$150 in 2008.

201205,Senate Backs Bipartisan Bill to Speed Drugs and Avert Shortages,"WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a major bipartisan bill on Thursday to prevent drug shortages and to speed federal approval of lifesaving medicines, including lower-cost generic versions of biotechnology products. A similar bill is on a fast track to approval in the House, perhaps as early as next week. President Obama, consumer groups and pharmaceutical companies strongly support the legislation. The measures reflect the government’s effort to keep up with new therapies developed during a decade of rapid progress in biomedical research. After months of legislative paralysis and political sniping, the sight of Democrats and Republicans working together on a significant bill was remarkable. The Senate vote was 96 to 1. The no vote was cast by Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who said the measure did “far too little” to make drugs more affordable. The bill would increase the government’s reliance on user fees, requiring makers of drugs and medical devices to pay $6.4 billion over five years to help finance the evaluation of their products by the Food and Drug Administration. The measure reauthorizes user fees for brand-name drugs and medical devices, and it introduces fees for the review of generic drugs and less expensive versions of certain biotechnology products, known as biosimilars. The chief sponsor of the bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said the fees for generic drugs “are expected to slash review times to a third of current levels, from 30 months to 10 months, and will improve the speed with which generic products are made available to patients.” Mr. Harkin, the chairman of the Senate health committee, wrote the bill over the last 18 months with Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the senior Republican on the panel. About 60 percent of the money for the review of applications for new drugs already comes from industry fees, which are used by the F.D.A. to hire scientists and buy equipment. If Congress does not act, the agency would have to lay off some employees. The bill would impose new requirements on drug makers to notify the government of potential drug shortages, which have become common in recent years. Federal officials would have to take steps to “help mitigate or prevent” the shortages, perhaps by finding other sources of supply, in this country or abroad. Senators of both parties said they had received pleas for help from constituents affected by drug shortages. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the concern was personal because his wife was being treated for breast cancer. “Through 20 weeks of chemotherapy,” Mr. Reid said, “my wife, Landra, and I lived with the fear that the medicine she needed every Monday morning wouldn’t be there because there were shortages. Fortunately for us, the drug was always accessible. But many Americans have not been so fortunate. People die as a result of not having these medicines.” The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said, “This is an incredibly complex piece of legislation that strikes a difficult balance, protecting consumers while avoiding the stifling regulation that slows the process of bringing drugs and devices to market.” Democrats from states with thriving drug and device industries, like Minnesota and New Jersey, joined Republicans in saying they wanted to nudge the F.D.A. to accelerate the review of new products without jeopardizing patients’ safety. The Congressional Budget Office said the bill “would lead to earlier marketing of lower-priced drugs,” reducing the average price of drugs in the market and saving more than $750 million over 10 years in Medicare, Medicaid and federal subsidies for private insurance under the new health care law. Over the next five years, the budget office said, the F.D.A. would collect $4.1 billion in fees for the review of brand-name prescription drugs, $1.6 billion for generic drugs, $609 million for medical devices and $128 million for less costly versions of biotechnology products. The legislation sets performance goals for the agency, including deadlines that would reduce the time it takes for new products to reach the market. The goals were negotiated by the agency and drug and device companies. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said this arrangement was highly unusual. “Typically,” Mr. Burr said, “legislation is crafted in Congress, not negotiated in the back room of the F.D.A. with device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Congress is effectively shut out of the process until a deal negotiated behind closed doors is announced.” The bill would create expedited procedures for the review of “breakthrough drug therapies” for life-threatening diseases. It would offer incentives for the development of antibiotics to treat infections caused by germs resistant to existing drugs. The bill also requires more frequent inspection of foreign companies that produce drugs imported into the United States; increases criminal penalties for the sale of counterfeit drugs; and requires pharmaceutical companies to keep track of each batch of drug products from the factory to the pharmacy. The bill would also require the F.D.A. to perform more studies before regulating health-related software programs that run on smartphones and other mobile devices. Such programs, known as mobile medical applications, can be used to help people stop smoking, to help them manage diabetes or to highlight tumors on X-ray images, for example.

201205,Senate Backs Bipartisan Bill to Speed Drugs and Avert Shortages,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a major bipartisan bill on Thursday to prevent drug shortages and to speed federal approval of lifesaving medicines, including lower-cost generic versions of biotechnology products. A similar bill is on a fast track to approval in the House, perhaps as early as next week. President Obama, consumer groups and pharmaceutical companies strongly support the legislation. The measures reflect the government's effort to keep up with new therapies developed during a decade of rapid progress in biomedical research. After months of legislative paralysis and political sniping, the sight of Democrats and Republicans working together on a significant bill was remarkable. The Senate vote was 96 to 1. The no vote was cast by Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who said the measure did ''far too little'' to make drugs more affordable. The bill would increase the government's reliance on user fees, requiring makers of drugs and medical devices to pay $6.4 billion over five years to help finance the evaluation of their products by the Food and Drug Administration. The measure reauthorizes user fees for brand-name drugs and medical devices, and it introduces fees for the review of generic drugs and less expensive versions of certain biotechnology products, known as biosimilars. The chief sponsor of the bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said the fees for generic drugs ''are expected to slash review times to a third of current levels, from 30 months to 10 months, and will improve the speed with which generic products are made available to patients.'' Mr. Harkin, the chairman of the Senate health committee, wrote the bill over the last 18 months with Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the senior Republican on the panel. About 60 percent of the money for the review of applications for new drugs already comes from industry fees, which are used by the F.D.A. to hire scientists and buy equipment. If Congress does not act, the agency would have to lay off some employees. The bill would impose new requirements on drug makers to notify the government of potential drug shortages, which have become common in recent years. Federal officials would have to take steps to ''help mitigate or prevent'' the shortages, perhaps by finding other sources of supply, in this country or abroad. Senators of both parties said they had received pleas for help from constituents affected by drug shortages. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the concern was personal because his wife was being treated for breast cancer.

201205,CORRECTED-ANALYSIS-Hard-up telcos get stingy with mobile give-aways,"(In May 24 story, corrects Reuters instrument code (RIC) for Telefonica to, from.) * Telefonica, Vodafone cut mobile subsidies in Spain * French mobile goes low-cost, no frills * Shift in operators usual business model * Risky move for operators amid recession in Europe * Could hurt premium phone makers like Apple, Samsung By Leila Abboud PARIS, May 24(Reuters) - Save up now for that new iPhone: the era of free or cut-price phones when signing a new mobile phone contract may be soon be over in Europe. Telecom companies, facing a profit squeeze from fierce competition and regulatory pressures, are taking the knife to the generous subsidies that allow new mobile customers to get the latest smartphones on the cheap. Two of Europe's biggest telecom operators, Vodafone and Telefonica, are using Spain as a testing ground for this big change in their business model, while in France a new ultra-low cost mobile player Iliad won clients with a no-subsidy approach. It's a gamble that could boost telcos' bottom lines but could also lose them customers in recession-hit Europe. And it is likely to hurt mobile phone makers if people hold back from buying the latest smartphone, which at 600 euros-plus often costs more than a flat screen television. In Europe, telecoms companies' spending on phones more than doubled to 13 billion euros ($16.36 billion) last year, meaning more was spent on phones than on upgrading mobile networks, according to Bernstein Research. Globally, phone subsidies climbed more than 40 percent from 2009 to 2011 to reach $48.5 billion. ""There is a sense of uneasiness about very heavy subsidies and a realisation that they are not good for the industry,"" said Telecom Italia Chief Executive Franco Bernabe at a conference. Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said that operators could now scale back their spending since consumers were addicted to smartphones. ""There are now very good Android smartphones available with mid-to-low end pricing, so there is much less need today to heavily subsidise handsets to just fuel data growth,"" he said on an investor call. Traditionally, mobile operators buy phones in bulk from manufacturers like Apple or Nokia and then offer them for free or a low upfront cost to customers when they sign a new one or two-year contract. Although they usually recoup the subsidy during the contract, some firms are concerned that the approach saps profits, especially as the cost of smartphones creeps up and tech-savvy consumers expect upgrades every year. In Spain, where one in four people are unemployed, market leader Telefonica dropped subsidised mobiles for new customers in March and offered payment plans instead so they can buy them themselves. Vodafone soon followed suit. Both say they will focus their marketing dollars instead on keeping their customers they already have. In France, new mobile player Iliad launched its 'Free Mobile' service in mid-January with no phone subsidies whatsoever and rapidly attracted 2.6 million customers, prompting all of its larger rivals to match the model despite initially deriding it. The marketing chief of Vivendi's SFR Frank Cadoret predicted up to 30 percent of the French would soon buy mobile services this way. U.S. phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon , are watching developments in Europe closely. They are managing to prosper from the smartphone boom because of better pricing power, an d have so far adopted less dramatic measures like delaying phone upgrades and imposing fees of $30 when people get a new mobile. Sprint Chief Executive Daniel Hesse told Reuters that it was too early to tell whether further measures would be needed. ""Obviously the subsidies we pay have been going up, up, up... carriers have to take actions."" Cutting mobile subsidies is not without risk, analysts say, and it's far from certain it will become the norm. They have helped lock-in customers via long-term contracts. Eliminating them means people can leave when they want. There is always the risk that some companies will stick with subsidies to entice customers. In Spain, third-place player France Telecom is playing the spoiler to Vodafone and Telefonica by keeping subsidies to boost market share. And by severing the link between the phone and service, telecom operators are also opening the door for smartphone makers to bypass them to market. ""The single biggest card the operators have to play in negotiations with smartphone makers especially Apple is that they control distribution of the phones,"" said Thomas Wehmeier, telecom analyst at consultancy Informa. ""If they stop subsidising them, more phone makers could just start selling to customers directly and operators will have even less bargaining power."" Apple already does this discreetly in its U.S. and U.K. stores in partnership with Barclays, offering 6 to 12-month financing for iPhones. Retailers could also jump into the fray. Tesco ran a full-page ad in a London newspaper to tout its financing plans to customers buying iPads. APPLE, SAMSUNG HIT But the shift could also hurt phone makers, especially Apple and Samsung, which make the most expensive smartphones. Asian brokerage CLSA estimates that 42 percent of Apple's revenue last year came from telecom companies' mobile subsidies. Nokia, trying to make a comeback in smartphones, will need marketing and distribution support from telecoms companies if its new Lumia phones are ever to rival the iPhone. People also might trade down to cheaper models, such as the emerging crop of Chinese-made Android smartphones that cost $150-300 instead of $600-800 for an Apple or Samsung. Or they might just keep the one they have for longer, depressing sales. In France, phone sales are set to fall from 24 million last year to less than 20 million this year due to Free Mobile's effect, said an executive who declined to be named. In a worst case scenario where all operators kill subsidies, some $24 billion would be wiped out of the mobile phone market, said Pierre Ferragu, analyst at Bernstein Research. ""We don't think that is likely to happen though,"" said Ferragu. ""Operators in Europe aren't getting rid of subsidies but just offloading them to partner banks via financing plans, so we think consumer behaviour won't be affected too much."" EXPERIMENTS How it all plays out will depend on how consumers react and how telecom operators position themselves in each market. In France, 25 year-old Natalie Reynaud says she recently bought her own iPhone 4S and signed up for Free Mobile. ""I like that I can switch operators freely and not be tied into a long contract,"" she said, adding that mobile subsidies offered by France Telecom or SFR didn't tempt her. Reynaud also passed up a consumer loan offered by Free Mobile in partnership with a local bank because she didn't want to pay interest. France's established firms, France Telecom, SFR, and Bouygues Telecom plan to keep subsidies for their mainstream business as a way to attract clients. ""People have finally realised that premium smartphones cost the same price as a television! Few people want to lay out that sum at the beginning of their contracts,"" said Olivier Roussat, who heads Bouygues Telecom. But he admits firms will probably have to cut subsidies over time. ""If the French market heads to average monthly bill around 20 or 30 euros a month, it's [20120525 083605 GMT] obvious that we won't be able to subsidise mobiles."" In Spain, it's too early to tell how the three-month old subsidy shift will evolve. In the first quarter, which included only March under the new policy, Telefonica lost 170,000 mobile subscribers, Vodafone lost 90,000, while France Telecom gained 130,000 subscribers. José María Álvarez-Pallete López, who heads Telefonica's European businesses, told investors that the company knew it would lose customers initially but felt this was the right thing to do to keep its most valuable subscribers and improve profits. ""We think this is a change that is needed at a sector level,"" he said. A Bernstein analysis predicted that Telefonica and Vodafone could potentially add 25 percent to operating profit in Spain. But a sales clerk at a Phone House store in Madrid said that she had seen more customers opting for Orange since Vodafone and Telefonica got rid of subsidies. ""People are in a hurry to pick up the iPhone from Orange, because they are afraid that Orange will also cut the subsidies in a near future,"" she said.

201205,"Fate of BlackBerry's Popular Messaging Tool in Doubt --- As the Smartphone's Sales Shrink, So Too Do Users' Contact Lists; Research In Motion Curtails Effort to License Service","Corrections & Amplifications A Research In Motion Ltd. spokeswoman said the company remains focused on, and is committed to, BlackBerry Messenger, its instant-messaging service, and is ""excited to bring new capabilities"" to the service's user base. The spokeswoman had declined to comment on specific issues about the service during the reporting of a Marketplace article published Thursday. The article incorrectly implied that the company had declined to comment about RIM's overall commitment to BBM. (WSJ May 26, 2012) (END) Research In Motion Ltd. may have lost its dominance in the global smartphone market, but its instant-messaging service is still widely popular around the world. Now even that strong suit is threatening to weaken as world-wide sales of BlackBerrys falter and RIM softens efforts to leverage the messaging tool. Teenagers still embrace BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, for its quick and free instant messaging, and its easy-to-use contact list of friends. Security professionals -- police, firefighters and ambulance drivers -- have come to rely on it as one of the most dependable forms of electronic communications. There are more than 55 million BBM users today, up more than tenfold from the 5.3 million users in January 2009, according to RIM. In that same time frame, RIM's share of the U.S. smartphone market has dropped from more than 50% to less than 10%, according to research firm IDC. As BlackBerry users flock to Apple Inc.'s iPhone and devices powered by Google Inc.'s Android, they are also disappearing from the BBM contact list of their friends. That makes the service less useful, one dropped contact at a time. Kady Hadesman, a 17-year-old BlackBerry user from Franklin, Mich., said she used to have over 100 BBM contacts, whom she messaged frequently to chat about school and gossip. Now, she complains, ""my [BBM contact] list is at 26."" At the same time, a three-day RIM network outage across much of the world last fall has shaken confidence in BBM's reliability. The service is also up against a host of new competitors, such as Apple's iMessage and popular third-party messaging tools like WhatsApp Messenger, which can be used from most devices. Any bigger push by RIM to leverage BBM, however, is taking a back seat to Chief Executive Thorsten Heins' focus on pushing out the company's new phone and operating system later this year, according to people familiar with the situation. A RIM spokeswoman said the company declined to comment. That is a big shift from just a couple of months ago, when senior RIM executives were scrambling to figure out a way to capitalize on the popularity of the BBM service, these people said. Executives came up with a specific BBM strategy that aimed to open up RIM's proprietary network to other smartphone markers and carriers and license BBM as a service that could be used on a wide variety of devices including iPhones and Android phones, according to these people. The project was unofficially called ""SMS 2.0"" within the company, these people said. While some within the company worried that licensing BBM to competitors would further diminish any incentive to buy a BlackBerry, others saw the project as a brand-recognition driver that would help the company stay relevant until its next line of phones launched. RIM acquired a fast-growing New York-based messaging company called LiveProfile late last year as part of this strategy, according to people with knowledge of the deal. The small transaction wasn't publicly disclosed. LiveProfile executives didn't respond to requests to comment. But after RIM's two longtime chiefs, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, stepped down in January, Mr. Heins, their handpicked successor, ended the BBM push, these people said. He decided RIM shouldn't pursue licensing deals in general. ""It was not up for discussion,"" one person familiar with the matter said. BBM will appear on coming BlackBerry 10 phones, but RIM hasn't revealed any changes to the service. Still, RIM isn't letting BBM fall by the wayside. Recently, the company launched a new BlackBerry model in India with a dedicated BBM key, a first for the company. Last month, the company rolled out several new applications that allow users to access and link to popular social network sites like Twitter and Foursquare from within BBM. A handful of third-party messenger services are crowding the market, each trying to differentiate themselves from platform-specific tools like BBM. The most popular, according to app downloading tracker AppAnnie, is WhatsApp. The start-up declined to provide user numbers, but it has been at or the near the top of app downloads for over a year now. Another popular app is Touch, an offering from parent company Enflick, which started out as a simple messenger but is now trying to branch out into broader media communications. It has several million users. The difference between all these tools is negligible. Some offer a free model and are testing out advertising schemes. Others, like WhatsApp, require a one-time sign-up fee and then provide ad-free messaging. ""I would say right now BBM is still number one (in the messaging space) just by virtue of being around longest,"" said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. ""The question now is what is RIM going to do with this? Can they maintain this as a defensible position, especially when others catch on?"" Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,Corporate News: RIM's Sales Chief Exits,"TORONTO -- In another blow to Research In Motion Ltd., its London-based head of global sales is stepping down. Patrick Spence, whose high-profile role included helping to roll out the company's latest line of smartphones -- BlackBerry 7 -- around the world, is no longer at RIM, it said Wednesday. ""Patrick will be taking on a leadership position in a different industry,"" a RIM spokeswoman said in an email. ""The sales function will report directly into Kristian Tear, our newly appointed COO when he starts this summer. In the interim, the sales function will report to [CEO] Thorsten Heins."" Mr. Spence -- who is 37 years old and worked at RIM for 14 years -- is the latest in a string of executive exits at the company, which has seen its market share erode amid growing competition from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. RIM has lost roughly 75% of its market capitalization over the past year. Mr. Spence, who was one of the most public faces at the company, was set to be a key part of the launch of BlackBerry 10, RIM's next line of smartphones due out later this year. Through much of RIM's turbulent past 18 months -- with a falling stock price, network outages and slowing BlackBerry sales -- Mr. Spence took on a global-ambassador role. He was seen inside the company as a highflier, who was promoted quickly through the ranks. He was one of three executive vice presidents at RIM under Mr. Heins. In January, RIM's longtime co-chief executives, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, stepped down. Mr. Heins, then one of RIM's two chief operating officers, was named CEO. In March, Mr. Balsillie resigned from the board. Also in March, RIM's other chief operating officer, Jim Rowan, stepped down. RIM's chief technology officer also left.

201205,A Second Chance for Idle Electronics,"All the smart kids are selling their old gadgets, why aren’t you? More than 278 million mobile devices lie idle or deactivated in the United States, and nearly half are smartphones, consultants at Compass Intelligence say. Sure, most of those are destined for the recycling heap (You do recycle, right?). As for the others — the phones, tablets, game consoles, high-end digital cameras and other electronic goodies bought this decade — that’s cash sitting neglected in those drawers. Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones that sell for $270 new could be worth $200. A Wi-Fi-only 16-gigabyte iPad 2 that costs $400 new could fetch $300 or more. Here is how to sell them for the highest price. BUY A BRAND WITH GOOD RESALE VALUE Common sense dictates that if it was a highly sought-after consumer electronics item in the first place, like an iPhone or iPad, a Microsoft Xbox 360 or Sony PlayStation, a Nikon D90 or Canon 7D digital camera, there is likely to be strong demand for it used. If you are not sure how popular a device is, you could check Craigslist.org, eBay.com or Amazon.com to gauge broad interest. You could also peruse the various trade-in sites. Here are a few, but there are others: Swappa.com for Android devices; Glyde.com for gadgets and games; Gazelle.com for Apple products, as well as Android, BlackBerry and other phones; NewtonsHead.com for Apple products, including broken iPhones; BuyBackWorld.com or BuyMyTronics.com for all electronics; NextWorth.com for phones, cameras, tablets and games. A new site, Priceonomics.com, features more than two dozen price guides, for items from appliances to video equipment. A founder, Rohin Dhar, said in an interview, “We try to catalog basically all products ever made.” Then the company crawls through the Web, analyzing “hundreds of millions of listings” to find real-world prices. “With enough data,” Mr. Dhar said, “over time, it starts to get pretty accurate for what people are selling things for.” By far, Mr. Dhar said, Apple products are the most popular on the site. In a recent study, Priceonomics found mobile phones lost much of their value right away, and then continued to lose value more gradually over time. The exception was the iPhone. After 18 months, the iPhone retained 53 percent of its value, compared with 42 percent for Android phones and 41 percent for BlackBerry. “You can buy an iPhone 4S today and sell it a few months later on the secondary market for almost what you paid for it,” Mr. Dhar said on his blog. However, he added, “if you buy the latest big, fancy Android phone, a few months later it has lost hundreds of dollars in value.” TAKE CARE OF YOUR DEVICE Protect it from physical damage with cases and covers, advises Josh Smith of Gottabemobile.com, a news and review Web site. Buy an extended warranty from the maker — for example, Apple Care+ for iPhone — or from a third party like SquareTrade, squaretrade.com. When it comes time to sell, having a warranty that you can transfer has value, Mr. Smith said. If the screen is cracked, replace it yourself with a kit, or send it to a professional service like Phonedoctors.com or icracked.com. A flawless iPhone can be worth $60 or more over the value of one in good condition at trade-in time, he said by e-mail. Keep the original receipt, charger and accessories, as well as the box, to ship the device when you sell it later, Mr. Smith said. “This doesn’t have a huge impact on the price offered by Gazelle and others,” he said. Still, he added, “if you plan to sell to an individual, I’ve found that the box is a big plus, just because it feels more like a new product to the buyer.” PICK THE RIGHT TIME TO SELL Apple enthusiasts have this down to a science. MacRumors.com, a news and review site, provides a buyer’s guide with a product summary for each Apple product. A green dot means rumors suggest it is smart to buy, given that product’s life cycle; red means wait; yellow means buy, but only if you need it. Currently, only the new iPad is awarded the Buy Now green dot. Decide.com, a Web site and mobile app that tells when to buy electronics, sifts through millions of pieces of data to guess when a new product is coming out. Decide advises shoppers to buy or wait, using proprietary price and model predictions. The amount of speculation surrounding Apple product releases is overwhelming, but when a stock analyst like Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee writes that he finds “the upcoming sixth-generation iPhone refresh likely in the September-October time frame,” as he did recently, it helps to inform your timing. Based on observations of the market for used iPhones and iPads, “the best time to sell is a few weeks before the new iPhone is announced,” Mr. Smith of GottaBeMobile said. “It is possible to get a great price for a used iPhone right now, but many users aren’t willing to go without an iPhone until October.” Gazelle reports a recent spike in BlackBerry trade-ins, with a 14 percent increase in the last 30 days. The company said consumers, perhaps fearing rapid depreciation of the value of their BlackBerrys, were upgrading to other platforms quicker than ever before. But the trade-in values vary. A BlackBerry Bold 9650 from Verizon in good condition was valued at $26. A BlackBerry Bold 9900 from AT&T in good condition would fetch $177. CLOSE THE DEAL Now that you have completed your research, it is time to pull the trigger. Do you opt for Craigslist and instant cash, taking the necessary safety precautions to complete the transaction? Or do you choose eBay’s Instant Sale, instantsale.ebay.com, as more secure? For instant gratification in selling a used iPhone or iPad, Gazelle’s Gadget Trader, an iOS app, is tough to beat. In seconds it detects the device and reveals how much it is worth in good condition. Tap the Sell This Phone to Gazelle button and the deed is done. Mr. Smith of GottaBeMobile recommends services like Gazelle, Amazon, NextWorth and Glyde because they simplify the process, offering a safe and secure way to sell with free shipping and the ability to lock in prices. One last word about prices: If you hope to sell your phone to buy the latest iPhone in the fall, keep in mind that Apple typically discounts previous models. “Apple will likely sell the iPhone 4S for $99 and may give away the iPhone 4” with a two-year contract, Mr. Smith said. (The 3GS is expected to remain supported by Apple, so those models are still of value.) Once these price cuts happen, the resale prices for the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 will drop. “Sell before the drop for the best deal,” Mr. Smith said, “or buy after the drop if you don’t need the newest iPhone.” All prices are from Priceonomics.com.

201205,A Second Chance for Idle Electronics,"All the smart kids are selling their old gadgets, why aren't you? More than 278 million mobile devices lie idle or deactivated in the United States, and nearly half are smartphones, consultants at Compass Intelligence say. Sure, most of those are destined for the recycling heap (You do recycle, right?). As for the others -- the phones, tablets, game consoles, high-end digital cameras and other electronic goodies bought this decade -- that's cash sitting neglected in those drawers. Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones that sell for $270 new could be worth $200. A Wi-Fi-only 16-gigabyte iPad 2 that costs $400 new could fetch $300 or more. Here is how to sell them for the highest price.

201205,"The Canon G1 X: Big Sensor, Major Disappointments","You know why people carry around those big black S.L.R. cameras, don't you? Trust me: it's not for fashion's sake. No, they carry them around because the cameras contain big sensors. If there's one statistic that predicts photo quality, it's not megapixels: it's sensor size. Big sensors mean great photos in low light - and the ability to create that pro-style blurred background behind your subject. The most exciting camera developments of the last two years have been smaller camera bodies with big sensors in them. I was incredibly excited, in particular, to hear about the new Canon G1 X: a coat-pocketable zoom camera with a huge sensor: 0.92 inch diagonal. That's nearly the size of the APS-C sensor found in S.L.R. cameras like the Canon Rebel. It's 16 percent bigger than the Four Thirds sensor used by Olympus and Panasonic, and over six times the size of the sensors in previous Canon G cameras (and most other compacts). The G1 X is the latest in a long line of the peculiar cult-classic cameras in Canon's G series (G10, G11, G12 ). Peculiar because it's a one-piece camera with lots of features that high-end photo nuts want: metal body, a hot shoe for accessories, full manual controls, lots of buttons with amazing amounts of customization, and an actual eyepiece viewfinder. You don't swap lenses on this thing. Like its predecessor, the G1 X has a fantastic hinged screen that lets you shoot over your head, down at waist level, or even facing yourself. But the huge sensor makes the G1 X a whole new ballgame. I've spent a couple of months with the camera I was dying to love, and I have to say that I'm a little disappointed. Which is hard for a true-blue Canon nut to admit. First of all, it's a homely, ungainly contraption, full of corners and bumps; in a wind-tunnel test against the world's other cameras, this one would come in dead last. But that's O.K.: fans of the G's don't buy them for their looks. The viewfinder is another matter. It's great that Canon hasn't completely surrendered to the modern trend of eliminating the eyepiece viewfinder, which is still an advantage in bright light or very low light. What's not great is that on this camera, if you can believe it, the lens barrel actually blocks your view. I'm not kidding. You hold this thing up to your eye, and maybe one-fifth of the scene is blocked by the lens itself. It's impossible to compose a shot accurately this way. Now, when you're fully zoomed in to the full 4X, the lens is no longer visible. But still - how could you design a flagship camera and not notice that? If you know what you're doing, the photos are excellent, although they're rarely as good as an S.L.R.'s. The blurry-background effect - technically, shallow depth of field, caused by a wide aperture - isn't easy to achieve. What's the point of a huge sensor if you can't get the soft-focus background? More concerns: The battery lasts only two-thirds as long as its predecessor's: 250 shots on a charge, which is very low. Focusing is frustratingly slow, especially when you're zoomed in. The zoom seems to take a moment to engage after you push the lever (which surrounds the shutter button). The burst mode is an astonishingly slow 1.6 shots a second. (There is a 4.5 frames per second mode - six shots maximum - but you give up control over exposure, white balance and ISO, and the screen goes completely black while you're shooting!) The weirdest thing, though, was that I kept getting motion blur while in Auto mode. That is, if any part of my subject was in motion, it came out blurry, even in good light. That's something we haven't seen for years. And on a camera with a jumbo sensor? It made no sense! I was so baffled that I wrote to Canon about it, and got this prompt reply: ""Full Auto on the PowerShot G1 X is designed for snapshots of stationary subjects."" Wait, what!? $800 for a camera that's designed for still lifes? Yes. Canon suggests that if you want to take a picture of something moving, you should switch to P mode and increase the light sensitivity (ISO), or switch to Scene mode and choose a mode like Sports. Strangest thing I've ever heard. Video should be fantastic. The camera records in full 1080p high definition, has a dedicated start/stop button for video and has stereo microphones. It can also change zoom and focus while filming, which is still a relatively rare talent for a camera. In practice, the zooming and refocusing are so slow, they ruin many a shot. It takes six seconds to zoom 4X while filming, and about as long to refocus. Painful. O.K., I admit it; I'm harping on the flaws. There's a lot of stuff to love in this camera, too: fantastic ergonomics, buttons just where you want them, and superb photos, among other things. (You can see some sample shots here.) But nonetheless, for $800, I think you can do a lot better. Sony's incredible NEX series comes to mind, for example. The bodies of these cameras are far smaller than the G1 X's, yet they have full S.L.R.-size sensors inside. Of course, the NEX's interchangeable lenses stick out and add bulk. But over all, these cameras will disappoint or frustrate you far less often. And they offer Sony's incredible Sweep Panorama mode, which is just incredibly useful. The idea of a nearly S.L.R.-size sensor in a coat-pocketable camera is a sort of holy grail; I've been longing for it for over a decade. It's an amazing engineering feat, frankly. So let's hope that Canon considers the G1 X a trial balloon, a learning experience - and blows its own first attempt out of the water with next year's model. * How to Track Your Smartphone Data Usage * How Compatible Are Rival E-Readers? * The Prius V and Its Entune System * Tone-Deaf Lawyers Jeopardize the Draw Something Game * There Is a Lot of Big Tech News The New York Times Company Document NYTB000020120524e85o005bp ",NYT Blogs,24 May 2012,1112 words,canon g x big sensor major disappointment,know people carry around big black slr camera dont trust fashion sake sensor there one statistic predicts photo quality megapixels size mean low light ability create prostyle blurred background behind subject exciting development last two year smaller body incredibly excited particular hear new canon g x coatpocketable zoom huge inch diagonal thats nearly apsc found slr like rebel percent bigger four third used olympus panasonic six time previous compact latest long line cultclassic series onepiece lot feature highend nut want metal hot shoe accessory full manual control button amazing amount customization actual eyepiece viewfinder dont swap lens thing predecessor fantastic hinged screen let shoot head waist level facing whole ballgame ive spent couple month dying say im disappointed hard trueblue admit homely ungainly contraption corner windtunnel world dead thats ok fan dont buy another hasnt surrendered modern trend eliminating still advantage bright whats barrel actually block view im kidding eye maybe onefifth blocked impossible compose shot accurately youre zoomed longer visible design flagship youre excellent although theyre rarely slrs blurrybackground effect technically shallow depth caused aperture isnt achieve whats cant softfocus concern battery twothirds focusing frustratingly especially youre zoomed seems moment engage lever surround shutter burst astonishingly per maximum give white balance iso youre weirdest though kept getting motion auto part came thats something havent seen jumbo made sense baffled wrote got prompt reply powershot designed stationary wait thats life yes suggests something moving p increase sensitivity iso choose strangest ive ever heard video record high definition dedicated startstop stereo microphone also change filming relatively rare talent zooming refocusing ruin many painful im harping flaw ergonomics superb among sample better sonys incredible nex example far slrsize inside nexs interchangeable add bulk le often offer sonys sweep useful idea slrsize coatpocketable holy grail ive longing engineering feat frankly considers trial balloon learning blow attempt water next track smartphone data usage compatible rival ereaders prius v entune system tonedeaf lawyer jeopardize something game tech news york company document nytbeobp
201205,UPDATE 1-RIM sales chief hired by audio company Sonos-sources,"* Patrick Spence resigned this week to take Sonos job * Sonos audio equipment wireless controls music playback * Being passed over for COO job helped push Spence out-source (Adds details on Sonos) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 24 (Reuters) - Patrick Spence, who resigned this week as global head of sales at struggling BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd, has been hired as chief commercial officer at wireless home audio company Sonos Inc, several sources with knowledge of his plans said. Sonos is a privately held consumer electronics company based in Santa Barbara, California, with offices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, China and Malaysia. Sonos was not immediately available to comment. RIM declined to comment beyond a statement issued on Wednesday that said Spence was taking on a leadership role in another industry. Spence was considered a rising star at RIM whose promotion to the global sales position last July recognised his major role in building strong sales growth in Europe and emerging markets such as the Middle East. He was pivotal to the global launch of a range of BlackBerry 7 devices last year and worked to decentralize RIM's sales planning so it fit better with regional needs. But analysts suggest his close ties to former RIM co-Chief Executive Jim Balsillie may have left him isolated after Balsillie quit earlier this year over a major strategy disagreement. He was passed over for a vacant chief operating officer role at RIM this month, which one source said also pushed him to look for opportunities outside RIM. RIM's Nasdaq-listed shares, already languishing at lows last seen in late 2003, closed 3.4 percent lower on Thursday at $10.71. Sonos' audio system enables music to be played in different rooms of a house by its own remote control, or a computer, or smartphones and tablets from Apple Inc or running Google Inc's Android software. It can play tracks from a user's own digital music library and is compatible with a range of streaming music services including Last.fm, Sirius XM Radio Inc, Pandora Media Inc, and Spotify. As chief commercial officer, Spence will be a right-hand man to the company's founder and chief executive, John MacFarlane. The former head of Microsoft Corp's Xbox and phone division, Robbie Bach, sits on the board of Sonos.

THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW (www.afr.com) Alan Joyce, chief executive of Qantas Airways, announced yesterday an increase of more than 25,000 seats per week on the airline's east coast operations servicing Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast. ""Qantas is increasing capacity and frequency on key business routes to provide greater flexibility for customers,"" Mr Joyce said, adding that he was prepared to add as many extra flights as was necessary to maintain Qantas' 65 percent share of the domestic market. Page 15. -- Alison Watkins, chief executive of grain handler GrainCorp , yesterday said the company's strategy was to raise profits by A$40 million over the next two years. Increases of A$15 million are expected through improvements in the grain handling network, A$10 million from grain exports, A$10 million from improving its malt business and A$5 million from integration plans. ""We are happy with the business we got  we don't need to acquire anything,"" Ms Watkins said. Page 15. -- Bernie Brookes, chief executive of retailing giant Myer , yesterday criticised the political uncertainty in Australia, blaming it for negatively affecting Australian businesses. ""There's no doubt that business wants certainty  certainty and a focus on the macro and microeconomics the government can control and influence is what we'd love to see,"" Mr Brookes said. Page 17. -- Allen Lew, a senior executive at Singapore Telecommunications Limited, said yesterday that large opportunities exist within the Australian market for the telecommunications operator to grow its portfolio. ""Australia is the largest [information technology] services market in the entire Asia-Pacific, so we have to be very strong here, otherwise we don't have credibility to go up to the rest of Asia-Pacific,"" Mr Lew said. Page 20. -- THE AUSTRALIAN (www.theaustralian.news.com.au) Australian brewing giant Foster's Group Limited (FGL) lost brewing and distributing contracts that accounted for nearly 10 percent of sales under parent company SABMiller, it was revealed yesterday. Under change-of-control provisions caused by the global brewer's A$12.3 billion takeover of the former, rivals were able to terminate existing deals with FGL, with SABMiller saying losing the agreements ""was a known risk at the time of acquisition"". Page 21. -- Sam Walsh, executive in charge of iron ore at global miner Rio Tinto, expressed confidence for future Chinese demand for the commodity in Sydney yesterday. ""When we see the iron ore business, it is a very robust business and we see that continuing in both the short term and the long term,"" Mr Walsh said, adding that current demand was ""steady as she goes"". Page 21. -- John Borghetti, chief executive of airline Virgin Australia , yesterday criticised the practice of outsourcing and offshoring at a business lunch in Sydney.

Page 23. -- Kevin Lyons, general manager of long distance bus company Greyhound Australia, yesterday praised the operator's new business-class service between Sydney and Canberra. ""Travellers on Greyhound's platinum coach won't lose a moment of productivity with unlimited free Wi-Fi, on-board power plugs and USB connection,"" Mr Lyons said. Greyhound's one-way business-class fare retails for A$36 on the Sydney Canberra route. Page 23. -- THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD (www.smh.com.au) The chief executive of AGL Energy, Michael Fraser, yesterday said that the electricity retailer's purchase of Victoria's largest power generator, Loy Yang A, represented ""excellent value for shareholders"". The A$900 million deal will place AGL Energy equal in terms of capacity with main competitor Origin Energy in the national electricity market. ""We're buying this at - or near - the bottom of the cycle,"" Mr Fraser said.

201205,BlackBerry stock falls after sales chief resigns,"* Stock down 3 percent after Patrick Spence resigns * Exit not surprise given Balsillie connection-analysts By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Research In Motion Ltd fell more than 3 percent on Thursday morning after the BlackBerry maker said its global sales chief had resigned. The resignation of Patrick Spence, a 14-year RIM veteran, comes as the Canadian company struggles to sell legacy products and prepares for the make-or-break launch of its new smartphone later this year. London-based Spence had risen steadily through RIM's ranks and was widely credited with building strong sales growth in the Middle East and other emerging markets. ""Losing Patrick is undoubtedly a blow to RIM and he is a significant loss to the European operation,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. ""He was a well-liked and committed BlackBerry advocate who was highly regarded both inside and outside the business."" RIM did not name a replacement or say where Spence was going when it made the announcement late on Wednesday. Spence was pivotal to the global launch of a range of BlackBerry 7 devices last year and had worked to decentralize RIM's sales planning so it fit better with regional needs. His sudden departure was not a shock to some analysts, who said his close ties to RIM's former co-Chief Executive Jim Balsillie may have left him isolated after Balsillie quit earlier this year over a major strategy disagreement. ""Spence was a Balsillie protege so his departure isn't a surprise altogether,"" said IDC analyst Kevin Restivo. ""But his departure is still a punch in the stomach to RIM faithful as he helped the company rise to prominence in key markets such as the UK and the Gulf states."" New CEO Thorsten Heins moved quickly to put his stamp on the company after he took over in January from Balsillie, who had focused on sales, and founder Mike Lazaridis, who led product development. Heins filled a long vacant chief marketing job earlier this month and also named Kristian Tear as chief operating officer. Being passed over for that job may have influenced Spence's decision to leave, the Globe and Mail newspaper said, citing a source close to the company. The departure creates a void in sales as RIM struggles to sell existing devices seen as lagging those of industry leaders Apple and Samsung, while at the same time working on a major transition of its smartphone lineup to the operating system first used in its poor-selling PlayBook tablet. The stock was down 3 percent at $10.75 at mid-morning on the Nasdaq. It has lost three-quarters of its value in the past year and languishes at prices last seen in December 2003, when its annual sales were seven times smaller than its last quarterly revenue tally.

201205,ANALYSIS-Hard-up telcos get stingy with mobile give-aways,"* Telefonica, Vodafone cut mobile subsidies in Spain * French mobile goes low-cost, no frills * Shift in operators usual business model * Risky move for operators amid recession in Europe * Could hurt premium phone makers like Apple, Samsung By Leila Abboud PARIS, May 24(Reuters) - Save up now for that new iPhone: the era of free or cut-price phones when signing a new mobile phone contract may be soon be over in Europe. Telecom companies, facing a profit squeeze from fierce competition and regulatory pressures, are taking the knife to the generous subsidies that allow new mobile customers to get the latest smartphones on the cheap. Two of Europe's biggest telecom operators, Vodafone and Telefonica, are using Spain as a testing ground for this big change in their business model, while in France a new ultra-low cost mobile player Iliad won clients with a no-subsidy approach. It's a gamble that could boost telcos' bottom lines but could also lose them customers in recession-hit Europe. And it is likely to hurt mobile phone makers if people hold back from buying the latest smartphone, which at 600 euros-plus often costs more than a flat screen television. In Europe, telecoms companies' spending on phones more than doubled to 13 billion euros ($16.36 billion) last year, meaning more was spent on phones than on upgrading mobile networks, according to Bernstein Research. Globally, phone subsidies climbed more than 40 percent from 2009 to 2011 to reach $48.5 billion. ""There is a sense of uneasiness about very heavy subsidies and a realisation that they are not good for the industry,"" said Telecom Italia Chief Executive Franco Bernabe at a conference. Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said that operators could now scale back their spending since consumers were addicted to smartphones. ""There are now very good Android smartphones available with mid-to-low end pricing, so there is much less need today to heavily subsidise handsets to just fuel data growth,"" he said on an investor call. Traditionally, mobile operators buy phones in bulk from manufacturers like Apple or Nokia and then offer them for free or a low upfront cost to customers when they sign a new one or two-year contract. Although they usually recoup the subsidy during the contract, some firms are concerned that the approach saps profits, especially as the cost of smartphones creeps up and tech-savvy consumers expect upgrades every year. In Spain, where one in four people are unemployed, market leader Telefonica dropped subsidised mobiles for new customers in March and offered payment plans instead so they can buy them themselves. Vodafone soon followed suit. Both say they will focus their marketing dollars instead on keeping their customers they already have. In France, new mobile player Iliad launched its 'Free Mobile' service in mid-January with no phone subsidies whatsoever and rapidly attracted 2.6 million customers, prompting all of its larger rivals to match the model despite initially deriding it. The marketing chief of Vivendi's SFR Frank Cadoret predicted up to 30 percent of the French would soon buy mobile services this way. U.S. phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon , are watching developments in Europe closely. They are managing to prosper from the smartphone boom because of better pricing power, an d have so far adopted less dramatic measures like delaying phone upgrades and imposing fees of $30 when people get a new mobile. Sprint Chief Executive Daniel Hesse told Reuters that it was too early to tell whether further measures would be needed. ""Obviously the subsidies we pay have been going up, up, up... carriers have to take actions."" Cutting mobile subsidies is not without risk, analysts say, and it's far from certain it will become the norm. They have helped lock-in customers via long-term contracts. Eliminating them means people can leave when they want. There is always the risk that some companies will stick with subsidies to entice customers. In Spain, third-place player France Telecom is playing the spoiler to Vodafone and Telefonica by keeping subsidies to boost market share. And by severing the link between the phone and service, telecom operators are also opening the door for smartphone makers to bypass them to market. ""The single biggest card the operators have to play in negotiations with smartphone makers especially Apple is that they control distribution of the phones,"" said Thomas Wehmeier, telecom analyst at consultancy Informa. ""If they stop subsidising them, more phone makers could just start selling to customers directly and operators will have even less bargaining power."" Apple already does this discreetly in its U.S. and U.K. stores in partnership with Barclays, offering 6 to 12-month financing for iPhones. Retailers could also jump into the fray. Tesco ran a full-page ad in a London newspaper to tout its financing plans to customers buying iPads. APPLE, SAMSUNG HIT But the shift could also hurt phone makers, especially Apple and Samsung, which make the most expensive smartphones. Asian brokerage CLSA estimates that 42 percent of Apple's revenue last year came from telecom companies' mobile subsidies. Nokia, trying to make a comeback in smartphones, will need marketing and distribution support from telecoms companies if its new Lumia phones are ever to rival the iPhone. People also might trade down to cheaper models, such as the emerging crop of Chinese-made Android smartphones that cost $150-300 instead of $600-800 for an Apple or Samsung. Or they might just keep the one they have for longer, depressing sales. In France, phone sales are set to fall from 24 million last year to less than 20 million this year due to Free Mobile's effect, said an executive who declined to be named. In a worst case scenario where all operators kill subsidies, some $24 billion would be wiped out of the mobile phone market, said Pierre Ferragu, analyst at Bernstein Research. ""We don't think that is likely to happen though,"" said Ferragu. ""Operators in Europe aren't getting rid of subsidies but just offloading them to partner banks via financing plans, so we think consumer behaviour won't be affected too much."" EXPERIMENTS How it all plays out will depend on how consumers react and how telecom operators position themselves in each market. In France, 25 year-old Natalie Reynaud says she recently bought her own iPhone 4S and signed up for Free Mobile. ""I like that I can switch operators freely and not be tied into a long contract,"" she said, adding that mobile subsidies offered by France Telecom or SFR didn't tempt her. Reynaud also passed up a consumer loan offered by Free Mobile in partnership with a local bank because she didn't want to pay interest. France's established firms, France Telecom, SFR, and Bouygues Telecom plan to keep subsidies for their mainstream business as a way to attract clients. ""People have finally realised that premium smartphones cost the same price as a television! Few people want to lay out that sum at the beginning of their contracts,"" said Olivier Roussat, who heads Bouygues Telecom. But he admits firms will probably have to cut subsidies over time. ""If the French market heads to average monthly bill around 20 or 30 euros a month, it's obvious that we won't be able to subsidise mobiles."" In Spain, it's too early to tell how th [20120524 144117 GMT] e three-month old subsidy shift will evolve. In the first quarter, which included only March under the new policy, Telefonica lost 170,000 mobile subscribers, Vodafone lost 90,000, while France Telecom gained 130,000 subscribers. José María Álvarez-Pallete López, who heads Telefonica's European businesses, told investors that the company knew it would lose customers initially but felt this was the right thing to do to keep its most valuable subscribers and improve profits. ""We think this is a change that is needed at a sector level,"" he said. A Bernstein analysis predicted that Telefonica and Vodafone could potentially add 25 percent to operating profit in Spain. But a sales clerk at a Phone House store in Madrid said that she had seen more customers opting for Orange since Vodafone and Telefonica got rid of subsidies. ""People are in a hurry to pick up the iPhone from Orange, because they are afraid that Orange will also cut the subsidies in a near future,"" she said.

201205,"As rivals falter, Lenovo has emerging market edge","HONG KONG, May 24 (Reuters) - With home turf advantage in the world's biggest computer market and a foothold in major emerging economies, China's Lenovo Group is looking to turn market share into profit, heaping more pressure on U.S. rivals Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc. Concern that global tech spending, particularly in the developed world, is weakening faster than expected has battered Dell shares and prompted HP to axe some 27,000 jobs. To counter weakness in consumer spending in major cities in the world's second-largest economy, Lenovo is Casting its net wider. ""We are seeing strong growth in smaller Chinese cities,"" Chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing said this week, unveiling a 59 percent jump in quarterly net profit. He noted that personal computer penetration in China is still just 20-30 percent versus 99 percent in the United States. China has been Lenovo's traditional stronghold, contributing 42 percent of group revenue and boasting the business's highest operating margins. Lenovo has around a 30 percent share of the Chinese PC market, well ahead of Acer, Dell, Asustek and HP, all with single-digit market share, according to data from research firm IDC. Lenovo sold 2.5 million PCs in China in January-March, according to IDC, and company data showed the average selling price across its products rose 1.5 percent from the previous quarter to $545. In the fast growing tablet segment, its Lepad trails some way behind Apple Inc's iPad, but outsells Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab. Analysts note that while Dell has focused on high-margin products, Lenovo has aimed for volume sales to gain market share. The key for Lenovo, which has risen to the world's No.2 PC maker after its 2005 acquisition of IBM's PC business, is how to turn that market share into profit. In the year to end-March, Lenovo's operating margin was below 2 percent - though it was 4.5 percent in China - compared to more than 7 percent at Dell and HP. Yang said Lenovo would look to turn a profit in emerging markets once it hits a certain volume - or 10 percent market share. This would allow it to hook in customers and profit later when they upgrade their products, particularly corporate clients, analysts said. After quarterly profit fell sharply at both HP and Dell, investors are asking questions about their product strategies and management focus in a weak global economy. Sunny Chung, Allianz Global Investors Taiwan Domestic Equity head, said a slowdown would cause some build-up in PC inventory as there would be more uncertainty over demand later this year. Allianz Global Investors owns Lenovo shares. Lenovo lags HP by 4-5 percentage points as global PC market leader, but analysts expect the Chinese firm to take the top slot this year or next. Lenovo has unveiled a series of consumer products in China as it moves aggressively into smartphones, tablet PCs and smart TVs, though some analysts question whether all its products will have the same level of success it has had in PCs. ""Lenovo's strategy in China is to continue building its own ecosystem, such as notebook, desktop, tablet, smartphone and TV. This could be kind of a dream as it's not easy to generate large profits from building hardware,"" said Angela Hsiang, an analyst with KGI Securities in Taipei. BUYING MARKET SHARE Lenovo has been winning market share in other emerging markets, such as Russia and India, where it is the top vendor, but that has been at the expense of operating losses due to aggressive pricing. Yang said his company's focus over the coming quarters would be to improve profitability in these markets by increasing volume sales and controlling costs in areas such as hard disk drives. In mature markets, which generate more than 40 percent of Lenovo's revenue, the company has taken market share more by acquisition. Last year it bought Medion in a deal that valued the German consumer electronics retailer at around $900 million, and signed a joint venture with NEC Corp to sell laptops in Japan. Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming says Lenovo is open to more acquisitions.

201205,UPDATE 2-RIM's head of global sales leaving BlackBerry maker,"* Patrick Spence is latest in string of departures * Spence managed BlackBerry 7 launch, push to decentralize sales * Sales to report directly to CEO on interim basis (Adds report of possible reason for exit, background) By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 23 (Reuters) - The head of global sales at Research In Motion Ltd has resigned to take on a leadership role in another industry, the BlackBerry maker said on Wednesday, a major blow ahead of make-or-break product launches due later this year. Patrick Spence was a 14-year RIM veteran widely considered a rising star. A spokeswoman for RIM said Spence's last day with the company will be June 15. Spence was promoted to the global sales role in July after serving as managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. A source close to the company told the Globe and Mail newspaper that Spence likely stepped down after being passed over for the chief operating officer role recently filled by Kristian Tear, who spent most of his career at Sony Corp , Ericsson, and their Sony Ericsson mobile phone joint venture. Tear's role covers operational functions for handhelds and services, including research and development, global sales, manufacturing and supply chain management. RIM has seen a steady stream of departures in the past year as its once-dominant market share has slipped amid fierce competition from Apple Inc and phones running on Google Inc's Android software. London-based Spence helped launch a range of BlackBerry 7 devices last year and had also worked to decentralize RIM's sales planning so it fit better with regional sensibilities. Spence joined RIM soon after graduating from the University of Western Ontario, before the company had created its first BlackBerry smartphone. RIM spokeswoman Tenille Kennedy said the sales function will report directly to Chief Executive Thorsten Heins on an interim basis before coming under Tear when he starts work in coming months. RIM did not name a replacement for Spence or say where he was going. Heins replaced longtime co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, who stepped down in January, and has moved quickly to clear house. Other key executives have also exited the company in the past year. A chief operating officer, Jim Rowan, and head of software David Yach left in March, at the same time that Balsillie left the board. Other recent departures include Alan Brenner, a senior vice president for the BlackBerry platform, and Alistair Mitchell, a vice president for the BlackBerry Messenger instant messaging product. The head of RIM's India unit left in November, its head of government relations left months before that, and former chief marketing officer Keith Pardy departed more than a year ago. RIM said this month it had replaced Pardy with wireless veteran Frank Boulben, who has yet to start work. Analysts expect RIM to struggle to sell its legacy devices - widely considered inferior to Apple's latest iPhone and high-end Android devices - for several quarters ahead of the planned launch of next-generation BlackBerry 10 phones later this year. In July, RIM slashed 2,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of its workforce, to cut costs as sales and profit fell. Its developer relations and sales and marketing teams were particularly hard hit. The company posted a loss in its most recent quarter on the back of a writedown on unsold inventory and a slump in phone shipments.

201205,"Fate of BlackBerry's Popular Messaging Tool in Doubt; As the Smartphone's Sales Shrink, So Too Do Users' Contact Lists; Research In Motion Curtails Effort to License Service","Research In Motion Ltd. may have lost its dominance in the global smartphone market, but its instant-messaging service is still widely popular around the world. Now even that strong suit is threatening to weaken as world-wide sales of BlackBerrys falter and RIM softens efforts to leverage the messaging tool. Teenagers still embrace BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, for its quick and free instant messaging, and its easy-to-use contact list of friends. Security professionals—police, firefighters and ambulance drivers—have come to rely on it as one of the most dependable forms of electronic communications. There are more than 55 million BBM users today, up more than tenfold from the 5.3 million users in January 2009, according to RIM. In that same time frame, RIM's share of the U.S. smartphone market has dropped from more than 50% to less than 10%, according to research firm IDC. As BlackBerry users flock to Apple Inc.'s iPhone and devices powered by Google Inc.'s Android, they are also disappearing from the BBM contact list of their friends. That makes the service less useful, one dropped contact at a time. Kady Hadesman, a 17-year-old BlackBerry user from Franklin, Mich., said she used to have over 100 BBM contacts, whom she messaged frequently to chat about school and gossip. Now, she complains, ""my [BBM contact] list is at 26."" At the same time, a three-day RIM network outage across much of the world last fall has shaken confidence in BBM's reliability. The service is also up against a host of new competitors, such as Apple's iMessage and popular third-party messaging tools like WhatsApp Messenger, which can be used from most devices. Any bigger push by RIM to leverage BBM, however, is taking a back seat to Chief Executive Thorsten Heins's focus on pushing out the company's new phone and operating system later this year, according to people familiar with the situation. A RIM spokeswoman said the company remains focused on, and is committed to, BBM and is ""excited to bring new capabilities"" to its user base. That is a big shift from just a couple of months ago, when senior RIM executives were scrambling to figure out a way to capitalize on the popularity of the BBM service, these people said. Executives came up with a specific BBM strategy that aimed to open up RIM's proprietary network to other smartphone markers and carriers and license BBM as a service that could be used on a wide variety of devices including iPhones and Android phones, according to these people. The project was unofficially called ""SMS 2.0"" within the company, these people said. While some within the company worried that licensing BBM to competitors would further diminish any incentive to buy a BlackBerry, others saw the project as a brand-recognition driver that would help the company stay relevant until its next line of phones launched. RIM acquired a fast-growing New York-based messaging company called LiveProfile late last year as part of this strategy, according to people with knowledge of the deal. The small transaction wasn't publicly disclosed. LiveProfile executives didn't respond to requests to comment. But after RIM's two longtime chiefs, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, stepped down in January, Mr. Heins, their handpicked successor, ended the BBM push, these people said. He decided RIM shouldn't pursue licensing deals in general. ""It was not up for discussion,"" one person familiar with the matter said. BBM will appear on coming BlackBerry 10 phones, but RIM hasn't revealed any changes to the service. Still, RIM isn't letting BBM fall by the wayside. Recently, the company launched a new BlackBerry model in India with a dedicated BBM key, a first for the company. Last month, the company rolled out several new applications that allow users to access and link to popular social network sites like Twitter and Foursquare from withinthe BBMservice. A handful of third-party messenger services are crowding the market, each trying to differentiate themselves from platform-specific tools like BBM. The most popular, according to app downloading tracker AppAnnie, is WhatsApp. The start-up declined to provide user numbers, but it has been at or the near the top of app downloads for over a year now. Another popular app is Touch, formerly called PingChat,an offering from parent company Enflick,also based in Canada, which started out as a simple messenger but is now trying to branch out into broader media communications. Italready has several million users. The difference between all these tools is negligible. Some offer a free model and are testing out advertising schemes. Others, like WhatsApp, require a one-time sign-up fee and then provide ad-free messaging. ""I would say right now BBM is still number one (in the messaging space) just by virtue of being around longest,"" said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. ""The question now is what is RIM going to do with this? Can they maintain this as a defensible position, especially when others catch on?"" Write to Will Connors at will.connors@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications Research In Motion Ltd. remains focused on, and is committed to, BlackBerry Messenger, its instant-messaging service, and is ""excited to bring new capabilities"" to the BBM user base, according to a company spokeswoman.

An earlier version of this article, however, incorrectly implied that the company had declined to comment about RIM's overall commitment to BBM. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,Google's Mobile Balancing Act,"Google Inc. begins a delicate balancing act in the world of mobile devices after finally closing its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. on Tuesday. With its biggest deal yet, Google is now armed with the hardware and software needed to build its own devices and muscle against Apple Inc.'s highly profitable iPhone and iPad. But as Google attempts to repair Motorola's unprofitable hardware business, it will also have to maintain strong ties with the dozens of other hardware makers that compete with Motorola and build devices using Google's free Android software. More than 300 million Android devices have been activated world-wide, including Motorola's line of Droid smartphones. Google is dependent on these handset makers to distribute its main moneymaker -- the Web-search engine -- and other mobile services that come with the software. The top Android hardware makers -- Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp., Sony Corp., and LG Electronics Inc. -- initially expressed formal support for the deal, after Google said its possession of more than 17,000 Motorola patents would protect the ""Android ecosystem"" from patent lawsuits. Behind the scenes, however, executives at many of the Android partners have privately expressed concerns about Google favoring Motorola after the deal closed. A recent shift in Google's Android strategy may help to allay such concerns. The company is looking to give multiple device makers early access to new releases of Android software to sell those devices directly to consumers, people familiar with the matter have said. That formula is different from Google's previous practice of joining with only one hardware maker -- like it did with Motorola in creating the Xoom tablet last year -- to produce a ""lead device"" before releasing the software to other device makers. That means Google could give Motorola and other hardware partners equal access to Android. Chinese antitrust authorities over the weekend said they cleared the deal on the condition that Google keep Android free and available without discriminating against any particular device maker for five years. Google's Android chief, Andy Rubin, has said there would be a ""firewall"" between Google and Motorola and he would have no knowledge of Motorola's affairs. Rajeev Chand, head of research at boutique investment bank Rutberg & Co., said it might take a year or two to find out whether Google can successfully employ an ""integrated"" approach like Apple's, while also ""serving needs and drawing business from an ecosystem"" of other hardware makers. Meanwhile, Google will be taking on Motorola's more than 90 facilities around the world and about 20,000 employees -- a figure that some analysts expect to be cut by Google. It will also have to run manufacturing plants, manage inventory and nurture relations with carriers and retailers. Even before the deal closed, Google explored potentially selling Motorola's TV set-top box business, which could be worth more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. A Google spokeswoman pointed to past statements that the company would run Motorola as a separate business, and declined to comment further. Motorola sold more than 17 million Android-powered smartphones last year and ranked fifth among hardware makers in terms of Android market share, at 7.9%, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Google named longtime executive Dennis Woodside as Motorola's chief. The 43-year-old Mr. Woodside had been head of Google's sales in the Americas and before then had helped to build the company's business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Mr. Woodside said he would focus the company's ""remarkable talent on fewer, bigger bets."" Essentially, he plans to whittle down the number of devices Motorola manufactures. Sanjay Jha, who had been Motorola's chief executive since it became an independent entity in January 2011, will leave the company. Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,Business Highlights,"------ Between Facebook and JPMorgan, Wall Street woes mount NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost four years after the financial crisis, Wall Street still can't get it right. Investor anger mounted Wednesday over the initial public offering of Facebook stock last week, which was fumbled by the banks that managed the deal and complicated by technical problems at the Nasdaq stock exchange. Shareholders filed at least two lawsuits against Facebook and Morgan Stanley, the bank that shepherded the IPO, over reports that it withheld negative analyst reports about Facebook from some clients before the company went public. It was the second stumble this month by a major Wall Street firm. JPMorgan Chase, usually revered for taming risk, has yet to contain a growing $2 billion loss in one of its trading units. The missteps are further eroding the confidence of Main Street, or what was left of it after the financial meltdown of 2008, and reinforcing the sense that the game is rigged. ------ HP to cut 27,000 jobs to save up to $3.5 billion annually SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to jettison 27,000 workers as the growing popularity of smartphones, the iPad and other mobile devices makes it tougher for the company to sell personal computers. The cuts announced Wednesday represent HP's largest payroll purge in its 73-year history. The reductions will affect about 8 percent of HP's nearly 350,000 employees by the time the overhaul is completed in October 2014. HP hopes to avoid as many layoffs as possible by offering early retirement packages. The company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., expects to save as much as $3.5 billion annually from the job cuts and other austerity measures. HP CEO Meg Whitman plans to funnel most of the savings into developing more products and services that could help the company adapt to technological shifts that are driving demand for more mobile computing and software that is provided over high-speed Internet connections. ------ Facebook may move shares to NYSE NEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook is in talks with the New York Stock Exchange to move its stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market after a botched initial public offering on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook's much-anticipated IPO was delayed by a half-hour on Friday because of glitches on the Nasdaq. After pricing at $38, Facebook's stock closed up 23 cents on Friday and has been down since. On Wednesday, it closed up $1, at $32, still down nearly 16 percent from the IPO price. ------ Pressure on EU leaders to solve Greek crisis BRUSSELS (AP) -- Europe's leaders gather in Brussels under mounting pressure to soften their tough-love approach to the weaker economies among them. With Greece locked in political chaos, much bigger Spain warns it can't keep afloat without help, as stock markets around the world tank over fears the leaders won't have the political will to act. The summit will have to fight multiple fires: political uncertainty in Greece that could see it renege on commitments made to secure rescue loans; rising borrowing costs in Spain and Italy that could force them to seek bailouts; and sluggish growth across the region exacerbated by budget cuts meant to reassure markets about high debt levels. Leaders have said that everything will be on the table, including a discussion about whether 17 countries that use the euro should spread the risk and borrow money jointly -- issuing so-called ""Eurobonds."" This would mean every country could borrow funds at the same rate, substantially lowering the costs for the more indebted countries. ------ Oil drops below $90 for 1st time since October NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of oil dropped below $90 per barrel Wednesday, the latest milestone in a weekslong decline brought on by uncertainty surrounding economies from Europe to China. Benchmark U.S. crude fell by $1.95 to end at $89.90 per barrel. Oil has tumbled more than 15 percent this month and is at its lowest level since Oct. 21. Other commodities such as copper and cotton fell sharply as well. Stocks markets in Asia and Europe fell sharply, while U.S. markets erased most losses with a late-day rally. Analysts say oil is in an extended slump that should lead to cheaper gasoline and other petroleum-based fuels this summer. Gasoline, which is made from oil, already has dropped by nearly 26 cents per gallon since early April. The national average is now $3.68 per gallon; some experts say it could fall as low as $3.50 by Independence Day. The average price of diesel fuel is below $4 for the first time since February. It's good news for an economy that has slowed down since last year's fourth quarter. ------ US sales of new homes rose 3.3 percent in April WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans bought more new homes last month, the latest evidence that the U.S. housing market could be starting to recover. New-home sales increased 3.3 percent in April from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 343,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Sales rose sharply in every region of the country but the South. The gain pushed the annual sales pace to its second-highest level in two years. Economists were encouraged by the increase but cautioned that new homes are still selling at half the rate consistent with healthy markets. ------ Stewart becomes non-executive chairman of company NEW YORK (AP) -- Martha Stewart was named as non-executive chairman of the lifestyle, media and merchandising company that she created Wednesday. Stewart rejoined the board of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. in September at the end of a five-year ban on serving as a board member or as an executive of a public company as part a settlement with federal regulators related to insider trading. As non-executive chairman, Stewart will help set the direction for the business but will have no direct operating role. An executive chairman would typically also hold a top management role such as being CEO. ------ FDA panel votes against new use for Johnson & Johnson's Xarelto WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of Food and Drug Administration panelists voted against a new use for Johnson & Johnson's blood thinner Xarelto to reduce life-threatening blood clots. The FDA's panel of experts voted 6-4 Wednesday against the new use for the pill, saying too much information was missing from company studies to accurately gauge the drug's benefit. One panel member abstained. The FDA is not required to follow the group's advice, though it often does. A final decision is expected by June 29. ------ Kraft shareholders give `Mondelez' thumbs up NEW YORK (AP) -- Kraft Foods Inc. says shareholders approved the name ""Mondelez"" for its new global snack food business, which may put to rest the snickering that initially greeted the name. The Northfield, Ill.-based company said Wednesday the name was approved by more than 90 percent of shareholders who cast a vote. The name -- pronounced ""mon-dah-LEEZ"" -- will take effect when the company officially splits into two publicly traded companies later this year. Mondelez International Inc. will be home to global brands including Oreo, Cadbury and Nabisco. ------ Mazda, Fiat to work together on small convertible TOKYO (AP) -- Mazda Motor Corp. and Fiat SpA are working together on developing and manufacturing a roadster, or two-seater convertible, although the automakers will come up with different, distinctly styled models. The deal with Fiat of Italy, which controls U.S. automaker Chrysler, serves as a perk for a money-losing Mazda, and highlights the Japanese automaker's trademark product -- the best-selling roadster of all time. Both sides said in a release Wednesday they had signed an agreement to work together, but each manufacturer will use its own engine and styling. ------ By The Associated Press(equals) The Dow Jones Industrial average closed Benchmark U.S. crude fell by $1.95 to end at $89.90 per barrel. Brent crude, which helps set the price of oil imported into the U.S., dropped to a new low for the year. It lost $2.85 to end at $105.56 per barrel in London. In other futures trading, heating oil fell by 4.9 cents to end at $2.812 per gallon while wholesale gasoline lost 6.5 cents to finish at $2.872 per gallon. Natural gas added 3 cents to finish at $2.737 per 1,000 cubic feet. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,"A look at how selected chipmakers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: April 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC estimate that PC shipments in the first quarter were ahead of their expectations, though growth was modest in light of competition from smartphones and tablet computers. Hewlett-Packard Co. appeared to have regained some of the business it had lost as it was weighing whether to dump its PC business. Lenovo Group Ltd. showed strong gains over last year. Dell Inc.'s market share fell as it focused on higher-end, higher-profit machines. April 17: IBM Corp. reports flat revenue, falling short of analysts' expectations. Software and services revenue grew, but IBM's hardware and financing segments saw a decline. Intel Corp. reports first-quarter results that were held back by a shortage of hard drives, which meant that PC makers had to curb production and needed fewer Intel chips. The scarcity was caused by flooding of hard-drive factories in Thailand last year. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology PLC reports that its earnings in the latest quarter surged and revenue almost doubled. CEO Steve Luczo says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. But Seagate says it also shifted its product line to ""industry-leading products"" across all of its markets. April 18: Strong demand boosted revenue at Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs says the company benefited from growing global demand for new 3G- and 4G-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. But he says the cost of making more 28 nanometer chips could cut into profit margins in upcoming months. April 19: Microsoft Corp. reports a surprise rise in sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers. Analysts had assumed that many businesses and consumers thinking about buying a PC would hold off until Windows 8 hits the market in the fall. That didn't turn out to be the case as revenue in the Windows division increased 4 percent in the latest quarter. EMC Corp., one of the world's largest makers of data-storage computers, says first-quarter earnings jumped 23 percent, boosted by increased demand for its cloud computing products. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. says its computing solutions unit had flat revenue, while the graphics segment saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue because of lower demand for desktop and mobile graphics. SanDisk Corp., a maker of flash memory, says quarterly earnings sank by almost half amid weak demand and low selling prices -- trends the company expects will continue in the current quarter. The company says it expects demand to rise, but not until the second half of 2012. Altera Corp., a semiconductor maker, reports weak results it attributes to lighter-than-expected demand for its products, particularly from customers in the communications industry. In addition, the company said it had some issues trying to fill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. The company expects its business to rebound in the second quarter and says its backlog has significantly improved since the end of the quarter on stronger demand for its products. April 23: Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. says the business cycle ""bottomed"" in the first quarter. Orders rose 13 percent. CEO Rich Templeton says 2012 will be ""a good year for growth."" Xerox Corp. says revenue from its services business grew, while technology revenue, such as sales of document systems and supplies, declined. Services now make up more than half the company's revenue. April 24: Apple Inc.'s Mac sales for the quarter came in slightly below expectations, at 4 million. But Apple once again reported blowout iPhone sales, along with iPad sales that were two and a half times what it sold a year earlier. The relative strength of iPhone sales means they accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent. April 25: Business software maker SAP AG says net income rose 10 percent in the first quarter. It cited strong sales momentum for its high-speed HANA data platform and cloud-computing acquisition SuccessFactors. April 26: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which supplies chips under contract for other companies including Apple, predicts ""solid growth"" with stronger-than-anticipated demand for smartphones and tablet computers coming from the U.S. and China. Western Digital Corp., a leading maker of hard drives, says production is heading back up. That led to a drop in its stock price, as a bigger supply could lead to lower prices. CEO John Coyne says Western Digital and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods that hit factories in Thailand last year. They had led to industrywide shortages of hard drives. May 11: Nvidia Corp., which makes graphics chips and processors for PCs, tablets and other devices, reports quarterly results that beat expectations and gives strong revenue guidance for the current quarter. May 17: Salesforce.com Inc., a maker of Web-based business software, says it lost money in the first quarter, but adjusted profit and revenue beat expectations, and the company raised its forecast for full-year results. Tuesday: Dell Inc. says total product revenue fell 5 percent to $11.42 billion in the latest quarter as revenue from mobility products, software, desktop PCs, and storage products all decreased. Sales to consumers took a particularly sharp decline of 12 percent, while sales to the public sector fell 4 percent and revenue from large businesses decreased by 3 percent. Sales to small and medium businesses grew 4 percent. Wednesday: Hewlett-Packard Co. announces plans to cut 27,000 workers, or 8 percent of its work force, as the growing popularity of smartphones, the iPad and other mobile devices makes it tougher for the company to sell personal computers. Revenue in the PC division was flat as revenue from consumer products fell 4 percent, offset by a 3 percent increase in revenue from businesses. Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's second largest PC maker, says quarterly profit rose 59 percent on record sales. The company reported strong growth in Europe and North America despite economic problems there. For the fiscal year ending in March, global PC shipments rose 35 percent, while market share rose to a new high of 12.9 percent. Coming up: Not yet known: Oracle Corp.

201205,Dell shares down on disappointing 1st-quarter results and weak sales forecast,"Dell Inc.'s shares fell sharply in trading Wednesday after the computer maker reported disappointing fiscal first-quarter financial results and gave a weak sales forecast for its second quarter. THE SPARK: Dell reported that its profit fell 33 percent for its first quarter on weak sales to consumers, businesses and the public sector. It earned 43 cents per share on an adjusted basis on revenue of $14.42 billion for the period. That fell short of the 46 cents per share on revenue $14.91 billion that analyst polled by FactSet were anticipating. Dell also said that it expects its revenue of roughly $14.71 billion to $15 billion for its second quarter, below the $15.44 billion that analysts had forecast. THE BIG PICTURE: Dell's report furthered concerns that the technology sector's recovery will be long and slow. Dell's personal computers sales have softened as consumers have cut back their spending or opted to buy smartphones and iPads instead. The Round Rock, Texas, company is also struggling with mixed results in its sales directly to businesses and the public sector as the tough economy has caused these customers to curb spending. This has furthered concerns that Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co., Cisco and other bellwether technology companies may be dealing with slow or volatile sales trends. Cisco issued a sobering forecast earlier this month for the current quarter -- typically the company's busiest period -- that raised fears of what impact the economy is having on the technology sectors. And shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. fell Wednesday following Dell's report and ahead of its own earnings report that is expected after the market closes. THE ANALYSIS: Sterne Agee's Shaw Wu said the weaker-than-expected results were a surprise given the market's already low expectations. He noted that for the first time, Dell acknowledged that it's facing competition from alternative devices such as smartphones and tablets made by companies like Apple Inc. ""We are frankly not surprised as we have said in the past our belief that consensus was underestimating the competitive impact from Apple in both small and medium-sized business and enterprise markets,"" Wu wrote in his note to investors. Yet Wu and other analysts showed some optimism that Dell's focus on building its server and service business could benefit the company in the long run. Wu, who has a ""Neutral"" rating on the stock, reduced revenue and earnings-per-share estimates for fiscal 2013. SHARE ACTION: Dell's shares fell $2.63, or more than 17 percent, to $12.45 in afternoon trading. That is down nearly a third from its 52-week high of $18.36 set in mid-February. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Key developments in Google's $12.5 billion Motorola Mobility bid,"Here are some key developments in Google's Inc.'s planned acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.: Aug. 15, 2011: Google announces plans to spend $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility. Google would get Motorola's lineup of cellphones, tablet computers and cable set-top boxes. More important, Google would get Motorola's more than 17,000 patents -- a crucial weapon in an intellectual arms race with Apple, Microsoft and others to gain more control over the increasingly lucrative market for mobile devices. Aug. 16: Standard & Poor's says investors should sell Google's stock because it believes the decision to buy Motorola Mobility increases the risk to the company and its shares. S&P says that although the acquisition would include a patent trove, that might not be enough to keep Google's Android mobile operating software from encountering intellectual-property issues. Aug. 22: Standard & Poor's reverses course, saying Google shares have fallen so much that they've now become a good deal. Sept. 13: In a regulatory filing, Google reveals that the $12.5 billion purchase price is 33 percent more than Google initially offered. If the deal falls through, Google will still have to pay Motorola Mobility $2.5 billion. Sept. 28: It's disclosed that the U.S. Justice Department is taking a closer look at the deal. The move had been widely expected. Oct. 27: Motorola Mobility reports smaller net loss in the July-September quarter as phone shipments rises by more than 25 percent from a year earlier. Nov. 17: Motorola Mobility says its shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to accept the proposed sale. Dec. 2: With the Motorola deal still pending, the U.S. Justice Department approves Google's acquisition of online advertising service Admeld after concluding the deal wouldn't diminish competition in one of the Internet's most lucrative marketing niches. Jan. 26, 2012: Motorola Mobility issues disappointing results for the last three months of the year. It reports a loss, mirroring preliminary numbers issued three weeks earlier, amid fierce competition in the markets for smartphones and tablet computers. Some analysts have already been worried that Motorola Mobility will become a financial millstone that could drag down Google's earnings growth. If that happens, Google's stock price would likely suffer. Feb. 13: European antitrust regulators clear the deal. Although regulators say they didn't find a reason to believe that the transaction would pose any competitive problems, they raise concerns about Motorola's aggressive enforcement of its patents. Hours later, the U.S. Department of Justice also approves the deal. Feb. 22: Microsoft lodges a formal complaint with the European Union's competition regulator accusing Motorola Mobility of breaking competition rules with its aggressive enforcement of patent rights against rivals. The complaint also names Google, which Microsoft fears will continue Motorola Mobility's tight hold on key patents. It follows a similar complaint from Apple. April 3: The European Commission agrees to investigate whether Motorola is unfairly restricting competitors from licensing essential patents. Motorola holds patents that are essential for standards linked to 2G and 3G wireless technology -- the focus of Apple's complaint -- as well as Wi-Fi connections and compressing video for online use, which are at the heart of Microsoft's complaint. May 1: Motorola reports a slightly larger net loss in the first quarter as expenses grew more than revenue. Saturday: Authorities in China approve Google's bid, though they require Google to make its Android operating system for mobile devices available to all at no cost for the next five years. The condition is apparently in response to concerns that competition could be hurt if Google gives updated versions to Motorola and withholds them from others. Google doesn't currently charge for Android, and it already had pledged to make Android available to all its mobile partners. Tuesday: Google says it has completed the acquisition. With the purchase, Google expands beyond its roots in programming software to provide Internet search and other online services to manufacturing equipment for the first time. The expansion will test Google's ability to keep its business partners, shareholders and employees happy. Dennis Woodside, president of Google's Americas region, replaces Sanjay Jha as Motorola's CEO. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,PC maker Lenovo says quarterly profit up 59 percent on record global sales,"BEIJING (AP) - Lenovo Group, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, said Wednesday its quarterly profit rose 59 percent over a year earlier on record sales. Profit for the three months ending March 31 was $67 million, or 0.65 U.S. cents per share, the company announced. Quarterly sales rose 54 percent to $7.5 billion. For the full year ending in March, Lenovo said profit rose 73 percent to $473 million on a 37 percent increase in sales to $29.6 billion. Global PC shipments rose 35 percent over the previous fiscal year, while full-year market share rose to a new high of 12.9 percent. ""Our fiscal year ended impressively with strong momentum,"" said chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing in a statement.

""Lenovo is focused on leading the PC industry and building upon that leadership in the `PC-plus era."" Lenovo, which has headquarters in Beijing and in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, reported strong growth in Europe and North America despite economic problems there. Sales in such mature markets rose 85 percent in the quarter to $3.4 billion, accounting for 45 percent of Lenovo's revenue. It said PC shipments in North American rose 26 percent despite a flat overall market. Growth was helped by a joint venture with NEC Corp. in Japan and the purchase of Germany's Medion AG, a maker of multimedia products and consumer electronics. Both deals were completed in July. In its home China market, shipments rose 22.7 percent over a year earlier and sales gained 32 percent to $2.9 billion.

A gauge of home builders in S.& P. indexes rose 1.9 percent amid a better-than-estimated housing report. Best Buy stock rallied 1.6 percent after the company reported first-quarter profit that exceeded estimates.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.67 points, or 0.01 percent, to 12,502.81. The Nasdaq composite average fell 8.13 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,839.08. The day had started with modest gains until Dow Jones reported that Lucas Papademos, the former prime minister of Greece, said the nation was considering preparations to leave the shared currency. European Union leaders are planning to gather in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss how to revive growth. Equities rallied earlier on Tuesday as sales of existing homes in the United States rose in April while investors speculated that China and Europe would stimulate growth. The S.& P. 500 is now down as much as 8.7 percent from an almost four-year high in April. Still, the benchmark gauge is up 4.7 percent for 2012, lifted by strong economic and corporate reports. About 70 percent of the S.& P. 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results have topped analysts' estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

201205,PRESS DIGEST-Australian Business News - May 24,"Compiled for Reuters by Media Monitors. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW (www.afr.com) Logistics group Asciano yesterday declared that chief executive John Mullen could be eventually replaced by chief financial officer Angus McKay, after recently appointing the latter to run its Pacific National rail division. ""Ultimately my succession is a matter for the board but part of my job is to ensure there are several strong high performing executives with a lot of talent and potential in key positions in the company,"" Mr Mullen, who recently recovered from serious illness, said. Page 27. -- John Borghetti, chief executive of Virgin Australia , said a move by rival Qantas Airways yesterday to announce a reduction of flights to Uluru and Darwin in the Northern Territory would not affect the airline's expansion plans. ""It doesn't change our strategy or our position at all. We didn't really contemplate that kind of response from them because frankly it's not of importance,"" Mr Borghetti said. Lyell Strambi, chief executive of Qantas Domestic, said the airline was ""committed to having the right aircraft on the right routes"". Page 27. -- Paul Young, analyst at financial services giant Deutsche Bank, yesterday declared that volatility in the global economy and a concern over financial discipline could lead global miner BHP Billiton to postpone the approval of all of its three US$10 billion-plus mining ventures. The company's board is due to vote on its potash mine in Canada, Olympic Dam uranium mine expansion and the building of an outer harbour at Port Hedland in Australia before the end of the year. Page 28. -- Advance Technology Ventures yesterday said while Australia was a good proving ground for biotech firms, it was unsure whether Australian firms supporting start-ups had the entrepreneurial nous to transform good science into a commercial windfall. ""I think the science is here, but is the team here to hand it off to run the company? That is what I'm considering,"" Mike Carusi, general partner of the United States-based venture capital group said, adding that ""there are some interesting investing opportunities"" in Australia. Page 28. -- THE AUSTRALIAN (www.theaustralian.news.com.au) Myer saw its shares suffer their largest single day fall in over 12 months after the luxury retailer downgraded its yearly profit guidance and warned that it had failed to abate a drop in sales. ""We could have held our guidance and cut wages at store level and our investment in omnichannel, but our plan has been to look at the longer-term view of the company rather than take a short-term approach,"" chief executive Bernie Brookes said. Page 19. -- Westpac Banking Corporation head of retail banking Jason Yetton yesterday declared that he saw ""no evidence of lending standards being relaxed"", although he insisted that some of Australia's largest lenders were lowering interest rates to boost their market dominance. ""There were some banks which have been growing their mortgages above system and in the first half there was aggressive pricing in the market by certain players who have growth objectives,"" Mr Yetton said. Page 19. -- The largest shareholder in Fairfax Media billionaire Gina Rinehart, has failed in her bid to secure a seat on the board of the media group, after it voted to appoint former Ernst & Young chief executive James Millar to replace outgoing director Bob Savage. Mr Savage, who is David Jones chairman and former chief executive of IBM Australia, will retire from Fairfax on June 30 to be closer to his family. Page 19. -- Dean Paatsch, co-founder of the Ownership Matters governance firm, yesterday said it was impossible for him to stay away from the corporate world, despite taking a break for 16 months. Observers say Mr Paatsch is known as one of the biggest troublemakers in Australian corporate life, having railed against the remuneration packages of many senior chief executives. ""I give as good as I get. If someone has a crack at me, I'm happy to give them the same back. But  we always play the ball,"" Mr Paatsch added. Page 19. -- THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD (www.smh.com.au) Shares in junior minerals explorer Syrah Resources skyrocketed yesterday from A93 cents to A$1.82 after the company announced that it had discovered graphite in the African nation of Mozambique. ""We know more about this deposit than something that might have had 100 drill holes, which is underneath the earth - this is all out-cropping  we are confident it's a world-class deposit,"" managing director Paul Kehoe said. The ore, however, is yet to be assayed and a formalised estimate for the deposit is not expected for at least a few months. Page B3. -- Foreign workers on two pipe-construction ships used in the building of the Gorgon-Jansz-lo gas venture off the coast of Western Australia will not be required to apply for Australian work visas because they are operating outside of the migration zone, the Federal Court ruled yesterday. Justice Neil McKerracher said that the vessels owned by Swiss corporation Allseas Construction were not ""resources installations"". Union members have protested against Allseas and energy giant Chevron, saying they are favouring foreign workers over locals. Page B4. -- Bernie Ripoll, Parliamentary Secretary to the Federal Treasurer, yesterday said he would be open to a suggestion from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to increase fines on listed companies that fail to declare key financial details. The corporate regulator's push to raise penalties came after it fined contractor Leighton Holdings A$300,000 for failing to unveil a A$900 million hole in its accounts earlier this year. Page B4. -- Qantas Airways and its discount brand Jetstar will reduce flights to the Northern Territory after the carrier said the high Australian dollar was reducing foreign demand. Return flights to Cairns and Uluru will be halved to seven a week from September, while services between the latter to Perth will be cut to two a week from four until October 28, after which they will be suspended completely. Page B5. -- THE AGE (www.theage.com.au) Regulators in North America have indicated that they may not oppose Royal Bank of Canada's move to sell covered bonds directly to the public in a market that has traditionally been blocked to major institutional investors. The sale could open the door for Australian lenders to follow suit, which analysts say would dramatically reduce the cost of issuing bonds. Legislation permitting local banks to issue covered bonds domestically was introduced last year. Page B1. -- Demand for shares in social media giant Facebook , among Australian investors has dimmed following the company's float last week. Contracts for difference provider IG Markets yesterday revealed that it had secured US$1.1 billion worth of trades on Facebook, with up to 20 percent of that figure driven from Australia. ""There was an increase in interest seen for Facebook  on Monday and Tuesday trading,"" a spokeswoman for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group's E*Trade online brokerage said ""but since then the activity has slowed"". Page B2. -- Gl [20120523 214338 GMT] obal miner Rio Tinto , has won approval from the Queensland government to develop a controversial A$1.45 billion South of Embley bauxite venture. The expansion of its project, which would include a new open-cut mine, ship loaders and a power station, now only requires the support of Federal Environmental Minister Tony Burke before it can proceed. Mr Burke earlier this year intervened in the venture over fears that it could increase the movement of ships through the Great Barrier Reef, a decision criticised by Rio's Tom Albanese. Page B3. -- Don Stallings, group chief executive of Masters, yesterday said more than half of the big-box hardware retailing franchise's customers checked rivals' prices on their smartphones while they were shopping. In an address to the Bulky Goods Retailers Association, Mr Stallings added that retailers needed to improve their customer service and personal touch to secure sales.

In 2011, LGE made about 83% of its total revenues in overseas markets--22% from North America, 13% from Europe, 8% from China, 21% from Asia (excluding Korea and China) and Africa, and 14% from Central and South America. Together with its strong positions in relatively stable businesses, such as washing machines and refrigerators, Standard & Poor's believes this good geographic diversity should partially offset volatile demand in the electronics industry. However, the company's volatile operating performance in the handset business constrains the current ratings. LGE posted operating losses in its handset business in 2011 due mainly to a sharp decline in handset sales and the late launch of its smartphone products. LGE's share of the global handset market dropped to about 6% in 2011 from about 10% in 2009, and the company's share of the global smartphone market was only about 4% in 2011. Although we expect LGE's position in the global smartphone market to gradually improve on the back of relative strength in hardware technology, it remains uncertain whether the company can overcome intensifying competition in the handset industry. LGD has also made operating losses since the fourth quarter of 2010, due mainly to weak demand and low prices for LCD panels globally. In our view, intensifying competition in the LCD panel industry and uncertain global economic conditions make it unlikely LGD will post a positive operating margin in the next one to two quarters. Nonetheless, the company's strong position in the LCD market and increasing range of premium products, such as mobile display panels, should mitigate the weak performance to some extent. We assess LGE to have an intermediate financial risk profile. Fully consolidated measures of the company's financial performance deteriorated in 2011, with the ratio of its adjusted debt to EBITDA rising to about 3.5x, compared with about 2.5x in 2010, mainly due to weak profitability. However, we expect LGE's debt to EBITDA to recover to about 3.0x in 2012 following improved performance in its TV and home appliances businesses. Also, LGE raised Korean won (KRW) 1 trillion in equity capital through a rights issue in November 2011, which partially improves its financial flexibility. Liquidity LGE's liquidity is adequate. We expect the company's liquidity sources to be about 1.2x uses over the next 12 months. As of Dec. 31, 2011, LGE had about KRW2.7 trillion in debt due to mature within a year, compared with KRW2.6 trillion in cash equivalents. Supporting its liquidity is the company's good access to domestic capital markets as one of Korea's major conglomerates. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our view that LGE group will gradually improve its financial performance in 2012 and beyond, based on its competitive positions in markets for digital TVs, home appliances, and LCD panels. Also, increasing revenues from premium products such as 3D TVs, smartphones, and high-end LCD panels should help sustain LGE group's current business risk profile. We may lower the ratings on LGE if the group's operating performance weakens further, likely due mainly to intensifying competition and weaker-than-expected global demand, resulting in deterioration in its financial risk profile, such as consolidated debt to EBITDA in excess of 3.5x for a prolonged period. On the other hand, we may raise the ratings if the company's earnings recover materially, especially in its handset and LCD panel businesses, and, as a result, consolidated debt to EBITDA eases to less than 2.5x on a sustained basis.

201205,"UPDATE 2-China, new products raise Lenovo Q4 net profit","* Diversifying into smart TVs, tablets, smartphones * Home market of China continues to outperform * Analysts say Lenovo could overtake HP next year (Adds Insider link, details on smartphones) By Lee Chyen Yee HONG KONG, May 23 (Reuters) - Strong sales in China helped Lenovo Group Ltd post a 59 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit on Wednesday, meeting analyst expectations, as the world's No.2 PC maker begins to diversify more aggressively into smartphones, tablet PCs and smart TVs. Lenovo's PC shipments in the world's second-biggest economy were more than double the industry's pace in the quarter, helping the company to report earnings growth that beat smaller rival Dell Inc. As Lenovo diversifies, analysts are forecasting the company could overtake market leader Hewlett-Packard Co as soon as next year. HP reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. ""Even though China's economy is slowing down, it's still ahead of the U.S. and Europe, so it will continue to be the driver for Lenovo to get to be the world's No.1, a position it should be able to achieve,"" said Arthur Liao, an analyst with Fubon Securities in Taipei. Lenovo posted a net profit of $472.99 million for the fiscal year ended March, it said, versus a consensus forecast of $472.2 million from a poll of 29 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The PC maker recorded a net profit of $273.236 million a year earlier, it said in a statement posted on the Hong Kong stock exchange. That meant Lenovo earned $66.8 million for the fourth quarter versus a consensus forecast of $66 million, based on a Reuters' calculation using unaudited nine-month financial data. Lenovo's results stand in contrast to Dell, the world's No.3 PC maker, which posted a decline in quarterly results on Tuesday and forecast a 2 to 4 percent revenue gain in the coming fiscal quarter to $14.7 billion to $15 billion, short of the $15.4 billion Wall Street had been expecting. The reason Lenovo is outperforming Dell is because Dell is focused on high-margin products while Lenovo is aiming for volume sales to gain market share, said Jonathan Ng, an analyst with CIMB Research in Singapore. Recent rankings showed Lenovo had a worldwide market share of 13.4 percent, lagging HP's 18.0 percent, but ahead of Dell's 11.6 percent, according to research firm IDC. CROSS-SELLING IN HOME MARKET The ability of Lenovo to cross-sell consumer products and business products ""should sustain higher PE multiples for Lenovo, reflecting the ability to expand its portfolio beyond the PC space in China,"" JPMorgan said in a note before the earnings release. The company said its smartphone market share in China reached 9.5 percent in the quarter and its tablets had a dominant position of about 50 percent of the Android market in China. Lenovo plans to triple its smartphone shipments this fiscal year from around 5 million in the previous year, executives said. China is Lenovo's stronghold, accounting for 42 percent of total revenue, while mature markets such as Japan and Europe make up another 42 percent. Emerging markets account for the remaining 16 percent. Operating profit in China grew to $552 million during the fiscal year and the operating margin was up 0.1 percentage point year-on-year to 4.5 percent, the company said. Chinese government measures to curb inflation had cut economic growth, but China's PC market continued to outgrow the worldwide PC market, driven mainly by relatively stronger demand in emerging cities. However, sales of its Lepads and Lephones still lag foreign leaders such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, as well as local rivals Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp . In China, Apple still dominates the tablet market with a more than 70 percent market share, with Lenovo coming in a distant second with a single-digit share. In May, Lenovo launched a smart TV in China in hopes of satisfying increasingly demanding consumers who prefer to play games and watch movies online on bigger screens. Since the beginning of this year, Lenovo shares have climbed about 30 percent compared with the Hang Seng Index's 1.6 percent gain. On Wednesday, Lenovo's shares ended down 1.45 percent at HK$6.78, lagging the broad Hang Seng Index's 1.33 percent fall.

201205,Another Top Executive Exits RIM,"TORONTO—In another blow to Research In Motion Ltd., its London-based head of global sales is stepping down. Patrick Spence, whose high-profile role included helping to roll out the company's latest line of smartphones—BlackBerry 7—around the world, is no longer at RIM, the company said Wednesday. ""Patrick will be taking on a leadership position in a different industry,"" a RIM spokeswoman said in an email. ""The sales function will report directly into Kristian Tear, our newly appointed COO when he starts this summer. In the interim, the sales function will report to [CEO] Thorsten Heins."" Mr. Spence—who is 37 years old and worked at RIM for 14 years—is the latest in a string of executive exits at the company, which has seen its market share erode amid growing competition from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. RIM has lost roughly 75% of its market capitalization over the past year. Mr. Spence, who was one of the most public faces at the company, was set to be a key part of the launch of BlackBerry 10, RIM's next line of smartphones due out later this year. Through much of RIM's turbulent past 18 months—amid a falling stock price, network outages and slowing BlackBerry sales—Mr. Spence took on a global-ambassador role. He was seen inside the company as a highflier, who was promoted quickly through the ranks. He was one of three executive vice presidents at RIM under Mr. Heins. In January, RIM's longtime co-chief executives, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, stepped down. Mr. Heins, then one of RIM's two chief operating officers, was named CEO. In March, Mr. Balsillie resigned from the board. Also in March, RIM's other chief operating officer, Jim Rowan, stepped down. RIM's chief technology officer also has stepped down. Last month, two other senior executives at RIM, Senior Vice President Alan Brenner and Vice President Alistair Mitchell, left the company.

201205,Vodafone Slumps on Grim Demand; Profit Drops 13% and Outlook Is Weak; IPO in India Appears Unlikely This Year,"LONDON—Vodafone Group PLC said its annual net profit fell 13% as dismal economic conditions in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal choked customer spending there, prompting a £4 billion ($6.33 billion) impairment charge. The world's biggest mobile operator by revenue also warned that conditions in Europe are likely to remain grim for the rest of the year. Separately, U.K.-based Vodafone said it is unlikely to launch an initial public offering of stock at its Indian operations this year given New Delhi's decision to auction a number of telecommunications licenses. Vodafone said Tuesday that its net profit declined to £6.96 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, from £7.97 billion a year earlier. The most recent figure included a £3.5 billion gain from the sale of the company's stakes in French mobile operator SFR and Polish mobile company Polkomtel SA. It wasn't all bad news, however. Vodafone performed well in Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands, and the company's reach into fast-growing markets in India, parts of Africa, the Middle East and Turkey helped overall revenue rise 1.2% to £46.42 billion. Revenue from phone services in India was particularly strong, climbing 20% and showing signs of stabilizing after a prolonged price war in the country. U.S. mobile company Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone holds a 45% stake, also did well, contributing £4.9 billion to profit, up 9.3%. With its revenue from traditional fixed-line calls under pressure from free Internet services such as Microsoft Corp.'s Skype and the WhatsApp messaging system, Vodafone has focused on boosting the revenue it gets from downloads of Internet data, photographs and video. Data revenue rose 22%, excluding acquisitions and currency movements, thanks to the growing popularity of smartphones such as Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy handsets. The number of customers with smartphones reached 45% in the year ended March 31, Vodafone said. Our focus on the key growth areas of data, emerging markets and enterprise is positioning us well in a difficult macroeconomic environment,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said. Still, Vodafone cut its forecast for fiscal 2013, saying revenue from phone services will be ""slightly below"" its previous medium-term guidance range of 1% to 4%, blaming larger-than-expected tariff cuts imposed by regulators. In India, the coming sale of second-generation licenses follows the Supreme Court's decision to cancel 122 licenses earlier this year after it found irregularities in their allotment by the government. Vodafone's license wasn't among those canceled, but the company said it is interested in participating in the new auctions—which must be held by the end of August— as a way to increase its bandwidth in India. ""It's highly unlikely that we'll be able to do an IPO in the middle of spectrum auctions,"" said Marten Pieters, chief executive of the company's India operations. UBS described Vodafone's latest results as ""solid,"" noting a 2.3% rise in overall fourth-quarter revenue from phone services, which beat its expectations. Sanford C. Bernstein called the results ""modest."" Vodafone last month agreed to buy C&W Worldwide PLC for £1.04 billion, transforming itself from a pure mobile operator into the U.K.'s second-biggest mobile and fixed-line operator behind BT Group PLC. The acquisition will improve Vodafone's network coverage in the U.K. and support its business-to-business operations around the globe. In July, Vodafone said it would receive a £2.8 billion dividend from its stake in Verizon Wireless after a six-year wait and would return the bulk to shareholders. On Tuesday, Vodafone declared a final dividend of 6.47 pence, taking the total for the year to 9.52 pence, up 7% from a year earlier. During the year, the company also paid a special dividend of four pence, paid out of the income dividend it received from Verizon Wireless. As a result, total dividends rose 52%.

201205,Sony Is Optimistic on India,"NEW DELHI – Sony Corp.'s India unit said Tuesday it expects a 30% rise in sales this fiscal year, a strong indication that the country represents one of few bright spots in the Japanese electronics company's otherwise challenging global outlook. Sony said in a statement that the Indian unit is on track to become the fifth-largest contributor to its worldwide sales by next March. Last fiscal year through March, Sony India's sales rose 16% to 63.13 billion rupees ($1.15 billion). India, where Sony held the top share in the flat-panel television market last fiscal year, is one of few markets that the struggling electronics giant can count on as it tries to turn around its business after four straight years of losses. Earlier this month, Sony posted a group net loss of ¥456.66 billion ($5.75 billion) for the fiscal year through March, while its revenue fell 9.6% to ¥6.493 trillion. While growth prospects remain uncertain in developed economies such as the U.S., Europe and Japan, major global consumer electronics makers like Sony and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. are renewing their focus on emerging markets such as India, which is Asia's third largest economy after China and Japan. For this fiscal year, Sony forecasts a net profit of ¥30 billion and a 14% rise in revenue to ¥7.4 trillion, as it tries to increase sales in emerging markets to make up for sluggish demand in Japan and other developed markets. In India, rising income levels are driving up consumer appetite for electronic goods such as flat-panel TV sets, personal computers, smartphones and large home appliances like air conditioners. Sony India Managing Director Masaru Tamagawa said the company was seeing ""strong demand"" for its products, indicating that high inflation in India hasn't had much negative impact on demand for personal gadgets and home appliances. Sony plans to spend 4.50 billion rupees on the marketing of its laptop computers, flat-panel TVs and cameras in India this fiscal year. It also said it plans to add 500 staff this year, lifting the headcount in India to 3,800. Sony India gets 35% of its sales from flat-panel TVs, 20% from laptops, 15% from digital cameras and the rest from audio and other equipment. Mr. Tamagawa said the company would look at revising prices of its products in India after June depending on the movement of the Indian rupee. The Indian rupee has been weakening of late, falling to a fresh record low against the U.S. dollar Tuesday. Mr. Tamagawa added that the company has hedged its exposure to the Indian rupee until June at a fixed rate. Write to Rumman Ahmed at rumman.ahmed@dowjones.com and R.

201205,"With Motorola, Google's Mobile Balancing Act Begins","Google Inc. begins a delicate balancing act in the world of mobile devices after finally closing its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. on Tuesday. With its biggest deal yet, Google is now armed with the hardware and software needed to build its own devices and muscle against Apple Inc.'s highly profitable iPhone and iPad. But as Google attempts to repair Motorola's unprofitable hardware business, it will also have to maintain strong ties with the dozens of other hardware makers that compete with Motorola and build devices using Google's free Android software. More than 300 million Android devices have been activated world-wide, including Motorola's line of Droid smartphones. Google is dependent on these handset makers to distribute its main moneymaker—the Web-search engine—and other mobile services that come with the software. The top Android hardware makers—Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp., Sony Corp., and LG Electronics Inc.—initially expressed formal support for the deal, after Google said its possession of more than 17,000 Motorola patents would protect the ""Android ecosystem"" from patent lawsuits. Behind the scenes, however, executives at many of the Android partners have privately expressed concerns about Google favoring Motorola after the deal closed. A recent shift in Google's Android strategy may help to allay such concerns. The company is looking to give multiple device makers early access to new releases of Android software to sell those devices directly to consumers, people familiar with the matter have said. That formula is different from Google's previous practice of joining with only one hardware maker—like it did with Motorola in creating the Xoom tablet last year—to produce a ""lead device"" before releasing the software to other device makers. That means Google could give Motorola and other hardware partners equal access to Android. Chinese antitrust authorities over the weekend said they cleared the deal on the condition that Google keep Android free and available without discriminating against any particular device maker for five years. Google's Android chief, Andy Rubin, has said there would be a ""firewall"" between Google and Motorola and he would have no knowledge of Motorola's affairs. Rajeev Chand, head of research at boutique investment bank Rutberg & Co., said it might take a year or two to find out whether Google can successfully employ an ""integrated"" approach like Apple's, while also ""serving needs and drawing business from an ecosystem"" of other hardware makers. Meanwhile, Google will be taking on Motorola's more than 90 facilities around the world and about 20,000 employees—a figure that some analysts expect to be cut by Google. It will also have to run manufacturing plants, manage inventory and nurture relations with carriers and retailers. Even before the deal closed, Google explored potentially selling Motorola's TV set-top box business, which could be worth more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. A Google spokeswoman pointed to past statements that the company would run Motorola as a separate business, and declined to comment further. Motorola sold more than 17 million Android-powered smartphones last year and ranked fifth among hardware makers in terms of Android market share, at 7.9%, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Google named longtime executive Dennis Woodside as Motorola's chief. The 43-year-old Mr. Woodside had been head of Google's sales in the Americas and before then had helped to build the company's business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In a statement, Mr. Woodside said he would focus the company's ""remarkable talent on fewer, bigger bets, and create wonderful devices that are used by people around the world."" Essentially, he plans to whittle down the number of devices Motorola manufactures. Google said it hired Regina Dugan, who had been director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the R&D facility for the U.S. Department of Defense, to lead Motorola's ""advanced technology and projects group."" Google also said it hired Mark Randall to lead Motorola's supply chain and operations. Mr. Randall had helped Amazon.com Inc. to produce the Kindle Fire, which has emerged as a robust competitor in the tablet space. The Kindle Fire is a threat to Google because unlike the iPad and Android tablets, it doesn't come with built-in Google services. Sanjay Jha, who had been Motorola's chief executive since it became an independent entity in January 2011, will leave the company and could gain more than $62 million in exit pay, according to calculations by The Wall Street Journal and the Hay Group, a management-consulting firm. Google declined to make Motorola executives available for comment. Google has said it is on track to generate more than $2.5 billion in mobile-related revenue, or around 5% of total revenue, though mobile researchers have estimated that the vast majority comes from selling ads on Apple devices rather than Android devices.

201205,What's News—,"Business & Finance *** Analysts for at least two of Facebook's lead underwriters lowered their financial forecasts for the company while it was holding IPO roadshow meetings with investors. The company's shares fell again Tuesday, down 4.4% in early-afternoon trade. Japan remained the world's biggest creditor nation in 2011, as government currency-market interventions and companies' overseas acquisitions helped boost its foreign-investment holdings. An outspoken advocate for more credit easing said there is still room for the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further. The British government should resume printing money and possibly cut the U.K.'s already low interest rate if economic growth remains elusive, the IMF said. Canadian securities regulators alleged that Sino-Forest and certain former executives inflated timber purchases and sales, capping an 11-month probe into the forest-products firm. Nissan expects approval within a month from China to make its luxury Infiniti cars in the country, as the Japanese auto maker seeks to localize production to contend with the strong yen. Firms are shutting Australian coal mines and questioning whether to continue with billions of dollars of investments, squeezed between falling prices and rising costs. India needs to make tough decisions on spending and tax generation to boost investment, Prime Minister Singh said. BlackRock and two other investors bought about a 20% stake in Formula One for $1.6 billion ahead of its planned IPO. Mongolia is finding it harder to get its biggest mining firms listed overseas than to dig the raw materials out of the ground. U.S. officials' comments provided the strongest sign yet that J.P. Morgan's stumble could reshape the debate over implementing Dodd-Frank. Google completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility and named a new executive to lead the smartphone maker.

201205,Vodafone's Net Slumps,"LONDON -- Vodafone Group PLC said its annual net profit fell 13% as dismal economic conditions in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal choked customer spending there, prompting a GBP 4 billion ($6.33 billion) impairment charge. The world's biggest mobile operator by revenue also warned that conditions in Europe are likely to remain grim for the rest of the year. Separately, U.K.-based Vodafone said it is unlikely to launch an initial public offering of stock at its Indian operations this year given New Delhi's decision to auction a number of telecommunications licenses. Vodafone said Tuesday that its net profit declined to GBP 6.96 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, from GBP 7.97 billion a year earlier. The most recent figure included a GBP 3.5 billion gain from the sale of the company's stakes in French mobile operator SFR and Polish mobile company Polkomtel SA. It wasn't all bad news, however. Vodafone performed well in Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands, and the company's reach into fast-growing markets in India, parts of Africa, the Middle East and Turkey helped overall revenue rise 1.2% to GBP 46.42 billion. Revenue from phone services in India was particularly strong, climbing 20% and showing signs of stabilizing after a prolonged price war in the country. U.S. mobile company Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone holds a 45% stake, also did well, contributing GBP 4.9 billion to profit, up 9.3%. With its revenue from traditional fixed-line calls under pressure from free Internet services such as Microsoft Corp.'s Skype and the WhatsApp messaging system, Vodafone has focused on boosting the revenue it gets from downloads of Internet data, photographs and video. Data revenue rose 22%, excluding acquisitions and currency movements, thanks to the popularity of smartphones such as Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy handsets. The number of customers with smartphones reached 45% in the year ended March 31, Vodafone said. Our focus on the key growth areas of data, emerging markets and enterprise is positioning us well in a difficult macroeconomic environment,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said. Still, Vodafone cut its forecast for fiscal 2013, saying revenue from phone services will be ""slightly below"" its previous medium-term guidance range of 1% to 4%, blaming larger-than-expected tariff cuts imposed by regulators. In India, the coming sale of second-generation licenses follows the Supreme Court's decision to cancel 122 licenses this year after it found irregularities in their allotment by the government. Vodafone's license wasn't among those canceled, but the company said it is interested in participating in the auctions -- which must be held by the end of August -- as a way to increase its bandwidth in India. ""It's highly unlikely that we'll be able to do an IPO in the middle of spectrum auctions,"" said Marten Pieters, chief executive of the company's India operations. UBS described Vodafone's latest results as ""solid,"" noting a 2.3% rise in fourth-quarter revenue from phone services. Sanford C. Bernstein called the results ""modest."" Vodafone last month agreed to buy C&W Worldwide PLC for GBP 1.04 billion, transforming itself from a pure mobile operator into the U.K.'s second-biggest mobile and fixed-line operator behind BT Group PLC. In July, Vodafone said it would receive a GBP 2.8 billion dividend from its stake in Verizon Wireless and return the bulk to shareholders. On Tuesday, Vodafone declared a final dividend of 6.47 pence, taking the total for the year to 9.52 pence, up 7% from a year earlier. During the year, the company also paid a special dividend of four pence, paid out of the income dividend it received from Verizon Wireless. As a result, total dividends rose 52%. --- Kenan Machado and Rumman Ahmed in Mumbai contributed to this article. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,The Facebook IPO: A Miscalculation in the Mobile Strategy,"As Facebook Inc. begins life as a public company, it is confronting heightened concern about its business. One of the biggest question marks is its mobile strategy. Facebook's recent experience with app developer CrowdStar Inc. shows just how deep its mobile problems are rooted. CrowdStar was an active developer of social games on Facebook in 2010, with 50 million daily active users playing its games like ""Happy Aquarium"" and ""Happy Pets,"" said CrowdStar Chief Executive Peter Relan. But last month, CrowdStar stopped making new games for Facebook. Instead, the Burlingame, Calif., company plans to focus on creating games for mobile devices like Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Google Inc.'s Android-based phones. The reason: While the number of people accessing Facebook with their smartphone and tablets is exploding, apps such as games can't be accessed on the social network's mobile site. ""We don't see Facebook. . . as attractive a platform as we see the mobile platform, so we believe all our efforts in the future will be focused on the growth available in mobile,"" Mr. Relan said. Facebook takes a 30% cut of games sales through its payments system when game players buy virtual goods on the site. So games developers are paying a hefty tax to use Facebook, yet their apps don't work in the place where Facebook's growth is surging. More than half of Facebook's 900 million users access the site using smartphones and tablets, but they see a limited version of the social network that includes main features like the News Feed and friends' profiles. App makers don't have a presence on the mobile site, and Facebook only began experimenting with how mobile ads might work. ""There are a large number of developers building apps for mobile, and Facebook is a key driver of growth for many of these developers,"" said a Facebook spokesman. Now Facebook is forced to play catch-up after earlier deciding not to create a sophisticated mobile app for the site. Rather, executives wanted people to access the site using their mobile device's Web browser, said a person familiar with the matter. This person said the reason for that thinking was twofold: Facebook didn't want to be beholden to other platforms like Apple's iOS or Google's Android. The company also wanted to create one version of the site for all mobile technologies, rather than different versions for Apple iPhones or Android devices. The problem is that the technology called HTML5 that would support sophisticated games and apps won't be ready for another two or three years. The company has taken certain steps in recent months to beef up its mobile team, acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram and social discovery app Glancee. In both cases, Facebook acquired not only talent but the technology from both products. Facebook has yet to forge relationships with handset makers or carriers to push out phones that can compete, even as Apple churns out iPhones and Google closes its deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. Facebook's mobile miscalculation is underscored by how quickly people are adopting iPhones and Android phones, and using the apps through them. According to Gartner, iPhone sales should hit 139 million this year, up from 25 million in 2009, while Android smartphones could reach 364 million this year, up from around 7 million in 2009. As more people gravitate to smartphones and tablets, they're increasingly forgoing the desktop to the access the Web. Between 2008 and 2011, the percentage of U.S. adults who accessed the Internet from PCs grew to 62% from 54%. In the same period, the percentage ofdaily mobile Internet users rocketed to 26% from 4%, according to Forrester Research. ""People see this modality of consumption shifting from the PC to mobile,"" said Matt Murphy, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. ""On top of that, mobile feels like it's much more the kind of wide open that anybody can win kind of arena."" On Monday, some of these issues appeared to rise to the fore as Facebook's stock fell 11% to $34.03 in its second trading day. In a research note before Facebook's IPO last week, Morningstar analyst Rick Summer listed the company's potential failure to monetize its mobile usage as a risk factor and suggested that $32 a share was a ""fair value estimate"" for the company. ""The enthusiasm for Facebook is not misplaced,"" Mr. Summer concluded, adding that he was optimistic about the company's growth opportunity with mobile, ""but the market may be underestimating several near-term challenges for the company."" Over the course of Facebook's roadshow with investors earlier this month, the company's executives were repeatedly asked about their mobile strategy. Facebook warned in its IPO prospectus that a lack of mobile advertising was a risk factor. Now Facebook needs to convince app developers like CrowdStar and others to stick with it and not abandon its platform because it lacks a strong mobile ecosystem. Facebook is still heavily dependent on one games maker, Zynga Inc. About 15% of its revenue comes from payments on the site, with most of that derived from games made by Zynga. Another Facebook games maker, Funzio Inc., which was bought by Japanese mobile game company Gree Inc. this month, said it is focusing on mobile apps, rather than Facebook's website. Anil Dharni, Funzio's chief operating officer, said when the company was founded in 2009, it had high hopes for Facebook's platform and early success with its ""Crime City"" game, which had 1.3 million monthly average users in May on the Facebook site and on its iPhone and Android apps, according to AppData. But over time, the cost of acquiring new users shot up on Facebook, and the social network also began requiring game developers to pay 30% of their revenue to the social network. So Funzio ""evaluated the mobile space and we knew we were ready to do mobile,"" said Mr. Dharni. Still, he said he hasn't written Facebook off completely. ""Whenever they [Facebook] bring the power of distribution to mobile, we think that's something we need to adopt,"" he said. Facebook's mobile problem doesn't only affect developers. Brands also build apps for the site that can't be used on smartphones or tablets, said Justin Kirstner, director of social products at Webtrends. ""The key thing that most often comes up around mobile is, if you click on links that go to applications in Facebook, in mobile that breaks,"" he said. ""That's a big problem because of the amount of mobile usage."" License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

201205,UPDATE 2-Telenet eyeing joint bid for KPN's BASE -sources,"* Telenet seeking private equity bid partners -sources * KPN weighs Belgium exit as America Movil tender offer looms (Adds further context and background) By Sophie Sassard and Victoria Howley May 22 (Reuters) - Belgium's largest cable operator Telenet is talking to private equity firms about making a joint bid for KPN-owned BASE, the country's third-biggest mobile phone company, people familiar with the process told Reuters. Blackstone, Cinven, Providence, Bain and KKR are among possible partners, the people said. Dutch telecom group KPN is weighing a sale of the Belgian business at the same time as it seeks ways to counter America Movil's tender offer for 28 percent of its shares, which it sees as undervalued. It is not clear whether KPN's broader defence will slow the BASE sales process, in which presentations to potential bidders were initially slated to go out in the next two or three weeks. ""Every private equity player would try to team up with Telenet as there is no trade rival that could offer the same synergies here,"" said a person at one of the interested private equity firms. KPN could raise between 1.6 billion and 1.8 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from the sale of BASE, based on 280 million euros of estimated EBITDA for 2012, and multiples of between 5.5 and 6.5 times. KPN declined to comment. Telenet, controlled by Liberty Global via a 50.2 percent stake, is reviewing a bid for BASE that would limit its owner's financial contribution by teaming up with a private equity firm, the people said. It is consulting advisory firms Lazard and Goldman Sachs on the matter, the people said. The two banks declined to comment. Telenet markets TV, phone and broadband services to households and companies in Belgium. It holds a mobile licence but has not built a network, and buys minutes from Belgian rival Mobistar so as to offer clients mobile services. If it were to acquire BASE, it could offer its 4.4 million subscribers an all-in-one bundle including mobile calling over its own network. Acquiring BASE would be a first major step into mobile for international cable company Liberty Global, which has traditionally focused on its core business. Liberty has become a major player in European cable, with a presence in 11 countries, by buying up smaller cable operators. It now owns the Netherlands' biggest cable operator, UPC, and the second biggest in Germany, KBW. Until now, Liberty has been reticent to take on the extra expense and complication of running a mobile business, although it did look at bidding for Orange Switzerland when it was sold by France Telecom last year. A move for BASE could indicate that Liberty is willing to look at mobile opportunities when they can be done with low risk and without big spending upfront. ""Liberty sees the potential for bringing together cable and mobile businesses in the next five years, but the two businesses are very different so they also have misgivings,"" said a person close to the BASE situation. ""They want to get their toes wet without making a bold move."" Liberty could not be immediately reached for comment. The next question Liberty will face in its mobile strategy will be whether to bid for a fourth generation mobile licence in the Netherlands, which will be sold later this year. The Dutch regulator has set aside blocks of relatively cheap spectrum for new entrants in a bid to increase competition in the three-player mobile market. Such a development would be bad news for KPN on its home turf, where it earns most of its revenue and profit. With profit falling at home, KPN's debt ratios are creeping closer to its self-imposed ceiling of 2.5 times EBITDA earnings, making it tougher for it to keep dividend pledges. Like its peers, KPN saw its performance dented by competition-boosting regulatory measures and the rise of smartphones from Google and Apple, whose messaging apps allow users to avoid charges for voice and text. Selling its Belgian arm would buy KPN a little time and allow it to pay down debt. An exit from Germany, a growing business that requires steep investments to keep up with larger rivals, would be a bolder move. The recent tender offer from America Movil, which would make the Mexican telecom giant KPN's largest shareholder, could halt or slow the exit from Belgium and Germany.

201205,"A look at how selected chipmakers, computer manufacturers and services providers are faring","A look at how selected companies providing computers, components, services and related software are faring: April 11: Research groups Gartner and IDC estimate that PC shipments in the first quarter were ahead of their expectations, though growth was modest in light of competition from smartphones and tablet computers. Hewlett-Packard Co. appeared to have regained some of the business it had lost as it was weighing whether to dump its PC business. Lenovo Group Ltd. showed strong gains over last year. Dell Inc.'s market share fell as it focused on higher-end, higher-profit machines. April 17: IBM Corp. reports flat revenue, falling short of analysts' expectations. Software and services revenue grew, but IBM's hardware and financing segments saw a decline. Intel Corp. reports first-quarter results that were held back by a shortage of hard drives, which meant that PC makers had to curb production and needed fewer Intel chips. The scarcity was caused by flooding of hard-drive factories in Thailand last year. The company says hard-drive supplies improved during the quarter and the shortage is now over. Seagate Technology PLC reports that its earnings in the latest quarter surged and revenue almost doubled. CEO Steve Luczo says the company benefited from a general recovery in the market for hard drives. But Seagate says it also shifted its product line to ""industry-leading products"" across all of its markets. April 18: Strong demand boosted revenue at Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs says the company benefited from growing global demand for new 3G- and 4G-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. But he says the cost of making more 28 nanometer chips could cut into profit margins in upcoming months. April 19: Microsoft Corp. reports a surprise rise in sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers. Analysts had assumed that many businesses and consumers thinking about buying a PC would hold off until Windows 8 hits the market in the fall. That didn't turn out to be the case as revenue in the Windows division increased 4 percent in the latest quarter. EMC Corp., one of the world's largest makers of data-storage computers, says first-quarter earnings jumped 23 percent, boosted by increased demand for its cloud computing products. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. says its computing solutions unit had flat revenue, while the graphics segment saw a 7 percent decrease in revenue because of lower demand for desktop and mobile graphics. SanDisk Corp., a maker of flash memory, says quarterly earnings sank by almost half amid weak demand and low selling prices -- trends the company expects will continue in the current quarter. The company says it expects demand to rise, but not until the second half of 2012. Altera Corp., a semiconductor maker, reports weak results it attributes to lighter-than-expected demand for its products, particularly from customers in the communications industry. In addition, the company said it had some issues trying to fill orders that arrived in the last month of the quarter. The company expects its business to rebound in the second quarter and says its backlog has significantly improved since the end of the quarter on stronger demand for its products. April 23: Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. says the business cycle ""bottomed"" in the first quarter. Orders rose 13 percent. CEO Rich Templeton says 2012 will be ""a good year for growth."" Xerox Corp. says revenue from its services business grew, while technology revenue, such as sales of document systems and supplies, declined. Services now make up more than half the company's revenue. April 24: Apple Inc.'s Mac sales for the quarter came in slightly below expectations, at 4 million. But Apple once again reported blowout iPhone sales, along with iPad sales that were two and a half times what it sold a year earlier. The relative strength of iPhone sales means they accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent. April 25: Business software maker SAP AG says net income rose 10 percent in the first quarter. It cited strong sales momentum for its high-speed HANA data platform and cloud-computing acquisition SuccessFactors. April 26: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which supplies chips under contract for other companies including Apple, predicts ""solid growth"" with stronger-than-anticipated demand for smartphones and tablet computers coming from the U.S. and China. Western Digital Corp., a leading maker of hard drives, says production is heading back up. That led to a drop in its stock price, as a bigger supply could lead to lower prices. CEO John Coyne says Western Digital and its suppliers have now recovered fully from the floods that hit factories in Thailand last year. They had led to industrywide shortages of hard drives. May 11: Nvidia Corp., which makes graphics chips and processors for PCs, tablets and other devices, reports quarterly results that beat expectations and gives strong revenue guidance for the current quarter. May 17: Salesforce.com Inc., a maker of Web-based business software, says it lost money in the first quarter, but adjusted profit and revenue beat expectations, and the company raised its forecast for full-year results. Tuesday: Dell Inc. says total product revenue fell 5 percent to $11.42 billion in the latest quarter as revenue from mobility products, software, desktop PCs, and storage products all decreased. Sales to consumers took a particularly sharp decline of 12 percent, while sales to the public sector fell 4 percent and revenue from large businesses decreased by 3 percent. Sales to small and medium businesses grew 4 percent. Coming up: Wednesday: Hewlett-Packard Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. Not yet known: Oracle Corp. (June), Micron Technology Inc. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,Key developments in Google's $12.5 billion Motorola Mobility bid,"Here are some key developments in Google's Inc.'s planned acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.: Aug. 15, 2011: Google announces plans to spend $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility. Google would get Motorola's lineup of cellphones, tablet computers and cable set-top boxes. More important, Google would get Motorola's more than 17,000 patents -- a crucial weapon in an intellectual arms race with Apple, Microsoft and others to gain more control over the increasingly lucrative market for mobile devices. Aug. 16: Standard & Poor's says investors should sell Google's stock because it believes the decision to buy Motorola Mobility increases the risk to the company and its shares. S&P says that although the acquisition would include a patent trove, that might not be enough to keep Google's Android mobile operating software from encountering intellectual-property issues. Aug. 22: Standard & Poor's reverses course, saying Google shares have fallen so much that they've now become a good deal. Sept. 13: In a regulatory filing, Google reveals that the $12.5 billion purchase price is 33 percent more than Google initially offered. If the deal falls through, Google will still have to pay Motorola Mobility $2.5 billion. Sept. 28: It's disclosed that the U.S. Justice Department is taking a closer look at the deal. The move had been widely expected. Oct. 27: Motorola Mobility reports smaller net loss in the July-September quarter as phone shipments rises by more than 25 percent from a year earlier. Nov. 17: Motorola Mobility says its shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to accept the proposed sale. Dec. 2: With the Motorola deal still pending, the U.S. Justice Department approves Google's acquisition of online advertising service Admeld after concluding the deal wouldn't diminish competition in one of the Internet's most lucrative marketing niches. Jan. 26, 2012: Motorola Mobility issues disappointing results for the last three months of the year. It reports a loss, mirroring preliminary numbers issued three weeks earlier, amid fierce competition in the markets for smartphones and tablet computers. Some analysts have already been worried that Motorola Mobility will become a financial millstone that could drag down Google's earnings growth. If that happens, Google's stock price would likely suffer. Feb. 13: European antitrust regulators clear the deal. Although regulators say they didn't find a reason to believe that the transaction would pose any competitive problems, they raise concerns about Motorola's aggressive enforcement of its patents. Hours later, the U.S. Department of Justice also approves the deal. Feb. 22: Microsoft lodges a formal complaint with the European Union's competition regulator accusing Motorola Mobility of breaking competition rules with its aggressive enforcement of patent rights against rivals. The complaint also names Google, which Microsoft fears will continue Motorola Mobility's tight hold on key patents. It follows a similar complaint from Apple. April 3: The European Commission agrees to investigate whether Motorola is unfairly restricting competitors from licensing essential patents. Motorola holds patents that are essential for standards linked to 2G and 3G wireless technology -- the focus of Apple's complaint -- as well as Wi-Fi connections and compressing video for online use, which are at the heart of Microsoft's complaint. May 1: Motorola reports a slightly larger net loss in the first quarter as expenses grew more than revenue. Saturday: Authorities in China approve Google's bid, though they require Google to make its Android operating system for mobile devices available to all at no cost for the next five years. The condition is apparently in response to concerns that competition could be hurt if Google gives updated versions to Motorola and withholds them from others. Google doesn't currently charge for Android, and it already had pledged to make Android available to all its mobile partners. Monday: Motorola indicates in regulatory filing that Google plans to complete its acquisition by Wednesday. Tuesday: Google says it has completed the acquisition. Dennis Woodside, previously president of Google's Americas region, is Motorola's new CEO. Departing CEO Sanjay Jha will help to ensure a smooth transition. 7 Press Association, Inc.

201205,UPDATE 4-Best Buy vows to change tack; mum on CEO search,"* Q1 EPS 72 cents vs Street view 59 cents, ex-items * Same-store sales off 5.3 pct in quarter vs view off 2.7 pct * Interim CEO to detail turnaround plan later in summer * No word on permanent replacement for CEO * Shares up 1.5 percent (Adds interim CEO, analyst comments, graphic) By Dhanya Skariachan NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc's interim chief executive said on Tuesday the world's largest consumer electronics chain needed to ""change substantially"" to fend off online and discount rivals, but offered little in the way of details. Interim CEO Mike Mikan's comments came just weeks after Brian Dunn abruptly resigned from the top job during a probe that eventually found he had an improper relationship with a female employee, leaving the company without a permanent CEO as it starts planning for the all-important holiday season. ""We do not have all the answers today,"" Mikan said on a conference call after the retailer reported yet another quarter of same-store sales declines. Mikan promised to take bold steps and said he will shed more light on the turnaround plan later this summer. Best Buy did not give an update on the CEO search process. It only announced on Monday the hiring of headhunter Spencer Stuart to conduct the search, almost six weeks after Dunn left the post. ""The keys to this investment story remains whom will lead this chain in the future and what will be the plan to right the ship,"" Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said, echoing the view shared by many on Wall Street. While Mikan is a candidate for the post, industry watchers have said the retailer will likely have to pick an outsider as CEO for the first time in its 46-year history to regain Wall Street's confidence. At least two brokerages have downgraded the stock this month, citing lack of leadership. BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba, who recently downgraded the chain to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" worried that even if Best Buy named a CEO soon, the person may not have enough time to prepare the retailer for the holiday season. Analysts have also raised concerns about Best Buy's inability to compete effectively in a marketplace where customers often go into its stores to test pricey electronics, then search for better prices and buy the items online via desktop or using smartphones and other mobile devices. Same-store sales, or sales at stores opened at least 14 months, fell 5.3 percent in the first quarter ended May 5. Analysts, on average, expected a 2.7 percent decline, according to Thomson Reuters data. The chain has reported declines in same-store sales in seven of the last eight quarters. Still, a lower tax rate and an extra week compared to a year earlier helped the retailer beat Wall Street profit estimates for the first quarter. ""The reality is that nothing has changed yet,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said. ""Sales are still challenged, as are margins."" NOT NEARLY ENOUGH Earlier this year, Best Buy laid out a plan to close 50 large U.S. stores and lay off another 400 employees to cut costs. But analysts have argued the steps are not nearly enough to fix its problems. ""Turnaround is not closing 50 stores,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said, adding the company needed to shut at least half of its stores and focus on smaller stores and higher-margin products. The company's problems have been exacerbated by the recent departures of its chief marketing officer and the finance chiefs of both domestic and international businesses, as well as of the CEO. Founder Richard Schulze was also forced out as chairman after the probe into Dunn found that Schulze did not tell board members or company officials about the allegations. SALES HELPED BY EXTRA WEEK Net earnings fell to $161 million, or 47 cents a share, from $255 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 72 cents a share, beating the average estimate of 59 cents. Sales rose 2.1 percent to $11.61 billion, topping the average estimate of $11.52 billion, but the results were boosted by an extra week in the quarter versus the prior year. ""But for the extra week, this would have been a terrible result,"" Pachter said. Results were also helped by a lower tax rate and strength in its U.S. online segment. The company maintained its fiscal 2013 outlook, seeing earnings of $3.50 to $3.80 a share, excluding restructuring costs. Best Buy shares rose 1.5 percent to $18.45 after touching a low of $17.94 on Tuesday.

201205,European Factors to Watch-Shares to advance; EU summit eyed,"(Adds detail, company news; updates snapshot table) LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - European shares are set to rise on Tuesday on expectations that European leaders may agree on some measures to boost investor confidence at an informal meeting this week and that China will invest in infrastructure projects to combat slowing growth. Investors were also likely to find value in stocks that were hit hard during last week's sell-off following concerns that Greece might quit the euro zone and Spain's ailing banks might cripple the slumping economy. Futures for Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were up 0.6 to 0.8 percent. Financial spreadbetters earlier predicted Britain's FTSE 100 to gain as much as 0.8 percent. ""News today from the China Securities Journal that the country plans to speed up the approval of infrastructure construction projects to improve the economy is encouraging, and fits in well with Premier Wen (Jiabao)'s pro-growth comments on the weekend,"" Chris Weston, trader at IG Markets, said. ""There is also a heightened sense of expectations ahead of the EU (informal) summit on Wednesday, and a hope that French President (Francois) Hollande will continue his push for euro bonds, something that has been discussed for some time as the ultimate answer to creating a real fiscal union."" The new French president raised the idea of bonds jointly underwritten by all euro zone member states during G8 talks at the weekend and intends to raise it again when EU leaders meet on May 23, even if it goes against German Chancellor Angela Merkel's wishes. Mining shares are likely to advance, tracking gains in copper prices that rose on expectations that European and Chinese leaders will take steps to reinvigorate their economies. Xstrata, the world's fourth-largest copper miner, said Chinese demand for copper was likely to improve in the second half. The remarks came after some miners sounded a cautious note on expansion. European equities rebounded from five-month lows on Monday, with investors seeing value after the steep retreat to five-month lows and taking heart from global politicians' weekend pledge to combat financial turmoil and prevent a euro zone break up. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.5 percent higher at 975.04 points on Monday, breaking a week-long losing streak. U.S. shares rose 1.1 percent to 2.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1 percent on Tuesday.   COMPANY NEWS VODAFONE Vodafone lowered a medium-term target for revenue growth on Tuesday as consumers in southern Europe slashed spending and regulators upped the pressure on the world's largest mobile operator. MARKS & SPENCER Bellwether British retailer Marks & Spencer posted a 1.2 percent fall in full-year profit, its first decline in three years, as even its relatively older and more affluent customers were touched by the economic downturn. XSTRATA Chinese demand for copper is likely to improve in the second half, the head of Xstrata's copper unit said on Tuesday, as the miner pledged to lift output by about 60 percent over three years after some rivals have put the brakes on expansion. ARM HOLDINGS The head of British chip designer ARM Holdings on Tuesday shrugged off concerns that Europe's debt crisis may hit global consumer demand and sales of smartphones and tablets. SONOVA Swiss hearing aid maker Sonova expects sales and operating profit to grow in the current financial year after the strong Swiss franc hit its operating profit in 2011/12. TECHNIP The French oilfield services group agreed to buy U.S. engineering company Shaw Group's energy and chemical division for about 225 million euros in cash. Technip adds that its 2012 financial targets are unchanged. DEXIA The rescued Franco-Belgian bank said two directors, Isabelle Boullot and Francis Vermeiren, had ended their mandates as board members with immediate effect. The company named Karel De Boeck as replacement for Vermeiren.   Credit Suisse Group AG announced the issuance of 24,195,537 new shares as a result of the scrip dividend elections, representing 1.9 percent of the group's share capital. FINNAIR Finnish daily Ilta Sanomat reported on Tuesday that Finnair will announce a partnership deal with Norwegian on Tuesday or in the upcoming days. The Finnish flag carrier is seeking a parter to run its unprofitable European routes.. A Finnair spokeswoman denied such plans exist. HOCHTIEF The German builder's Australian unit Leighton said it sees a strong project pipeline ahead despite comments from major miners that they may cut spending on big new projects to conserve capital in an uncertain environment.

201205,ANALYSIS-Security features offer RIM a fragile lifeline,"* RIM still commands loyalty of security-minded niche * Police, insurer embrace PlayBook for sensitive data * RIM's hold on niche could attract takeover interest * RIM aims to profit from Apple's move into workplace By Alastair Sharp TORONTO, May 22 (Reuters) - Along with firearms, radio and other standard-issue gear, Constable Ken Koke's police cruiser comes equipped with portable technology made by Research In Motion Ltd that he says has become an important tool in policing rural Canada. Koke, with the Chatham-Kent police force in southwestern Ontario, uses RIM's PlayBook to run checks on vehicles and suspects. Unlike his old laptop, the tablet is portable enough to take out of the car to record evidence at crime scenes. But for law enforcement officers like Koke, the big draw is RIM's acclaimed network security, a feature that Apple Inc and RIM's other competitors can barely match, and cannot beat - at least not yet. Police, along with insurers, the military and thousands of government agencies, remain important customers for the struggling BlackBerry maker as a data breach could invite litigation, compromise reputations or even endanger national security. ""Despite the adversity and displacement RIM is experiencing across its enterprise customers, it's obvious that a hardcore contingent still see no solution better than BlackBerry,"" said John Jackson at CCS Insight, which advises wireless companies. The loyalty of that core customer base is a rare bright spot for RIM as it fights a tide of defections to flashier devices. Its still-unrivaled leadership in secure communications could also pique the interest of a potential buyer for the Canadian company, whose shares have sunk 80 percent since February 2011. ""When I go in the street I have my handcuffs, I have my sidearm, and I have my BlackBerry. It's part of my gear and not something I would leave the station without,"" Koke said. ""The PlayBook is a natural extension of that."" NICHE NOT SAFE But it's far from clear if that niche will be big enough to rescue RIM, which faces a continuing decline in sales for its once-ubiquitous BlackBerry, and whose compact PlayBook never took off with consumers. RIM does not specify what proportion of its sales go to security focused government, legal and military customers, and analysts don't break that market out of the broader ""enterprise market,"" which they believe has stagnated in recent years to make up about a quarter of RIM's 77 million BlackBerry users. Unlike Apple and other rivals, security-focused RIM has built direct connections between its servers and those of carriers and big customers, and its private network offers encryption that others need help to get. But the niche is not as safe for RIM as it used to be, given the arrival of smaller providers such as Good Technology, a private outfit based in Sunnyvale, California, that help companies beef up security on their employees' iPhones and Androids. Such offerings may not be as convenient for a corporate IT manager as RIM's out-of-the-box security, but they have enabled many companies to let their employees use personal devices in the workplace. The BlackBerry's secure approach is ""becoming less of an advantage for RIM because, frankly, organizations are being forced to put solutions in place to allow secure access to documents and apps and other things on (Apple's) iOS and Android devices,"" said Tyler Lessard, who left RIM six months ago to join Fixmo, a small mobile security company. To fight this challenge, RIM is taking an ""if-you-can't-beat-them-join-them"" approach, offering to manage other devices via a service it calls Mobile Fusion. Even if it no longer sells every device, the thinking goes, RIM can still profit by keeping office communications secure. Several analysts say RIM's strength in security and network components could attract takeover interest from companies that deliver online content such as Akamai Technologies Inc or Amazon.com Inc. Amazon took a look at RIM last year, but decided not to bid after RIM made it clear it wanted to fix its problems on its own. Ken Dulaney, vice-president for mobile devices at research firm Gartner, said RIM's connections into hundreds of carriers worldwide represent an ""intriguing"" asset that could hold value to Amazon or Akamai, the company that powers Apple's iTunes store. At a current valuation of less than $6 billion, a fraction of its 2008 peak of $84 billion, RIM might look cheap to a company such as International Business Machines Corp. IBM could use RIM's assets to expand corporate services on to mobile platforms, said Northern Securities analyst Sameet Kanade. RIM's customer base alone could tempt buyers such as Cisco Systems Inc, he added, but cautioned that prospective buyers could also choose to build such capabilities internally. Security aside, the larger market for smartphones and tablets is turning away from RIM, which now has less than 7 percent of the global smartphone market, according to Gartner, down from 13 percent a year ago. CEO Thorsten Heins is putting his hopes on a new generation of phones, due later this year, as well as possible asset sales. He has not ruled out a sale of the entire company. ""The rules have changed,"" said David Krebs, vice-president for mobile and wireless practice at VDC Research. ""They're not acting from a position of strength today."" A LOYAL CORE But at the same time, the most security-conscious customers prefer the tried-and-true RIM approach. Aviva Plc, one of Britain's largest insurers, has handed out PlayBooks to scores of risk assessors, the type of traditional road warrior that first worshipped the BlackBerry. ""For any role in Aviva that's collecting data, why would we use anything but the PlayBook,"" said Paul Heybourne, who heads the company's global technology innovation efforts. Meanwhile, the Pentagon, RIM's single largest customer, this month approved six recent BlackBerry models for use on its secure networks, meaning some quarter of a million military and intelligence staff can upgrade to more modern devices. Counterparts in Britain and Australia followed soon after. David Paterson, RIM's vice-president for government relations and public policy, said BlackBerry sales to the U.S. government are still growing. ""There is no mass exodus,"" he insisted, even after Washington's main procurement agency, the General Services Administration, loosened its BlackBerry allegiance to adopt an approach more open to RIM's rivals. If RIM fends off its challenges until new phones and tablets are ready - and if the market embraces the new devices - its future could brighten. If not, a takeover could loom.

201205,UPDATE 2-Telenet eyeing joint bid for KPN's BASE -sources,"* Telenet seeking private equity bid partners -sources * KPN weighs Belgium exit as America Movil tender offer looms (Adds further context and background) By Sophie Sassard and Victoria Howley May 22 (Reuters) - Belgium's largest cable operator Telenet is talking to private equity firms about making a joint bid for KPN-owned BASE, the country's third-biggest mobile phone company, people familiar with the process told Reuters. Blackstone, Cinven, Providence, Bain and KKR are among possible partners, the people said. Dutch telecom group KPN is weighing a sale of the Belgian business at the same time as it seeks ways to counter America Movil's tender offer for 28 percent of its shares, which it sees as undervalued. It is not clear whether KPN's broader defence will slow the BASE sales process, in which presentations to potential bidders were initially slated to go out in the next two or three weeks. ""Every private equity player would try to team up with Telenet as there is no trade rival that could offer the same synergies here,"" said a person at one of the interested private equity firms. KPN could raise between 1.6 billion and 1.8 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from the sale of BASE, based on 280 million euros of estimated EBITDA for 2012, and multiples of between 5.5 and 6.5 times. KPN declined to comment. Telenet, controlled by Liberty Global via a 50.2 percent stake, is reviewing a bid for BASE that would limit its owner's financial contribution by teaming up with a private equity firm, the people said. It is consulting advisory firms Lazard and Goldman Sachs on the matter, the people said. The two banks declined to comment. Telenet markets TV, phone and broadband services to households and companies in Belgium. It holds a mobile licence but has not built a network, and buys minutes from Belgian rival Mobistar so as to offer clients mobile services. If it were to acquire BASE, it could offer its 4.4 million subscribers an all-in-one bundle including mobile calling over its own network. Acquiring BASE would be a first major step into mobile for international cable company Liberty Global, which has traditionally focused on its core business. Liberty has become a major player in European cable, with a presence in 11 countries, by buying up smaller cable operators. It now owns the Netherlands' biggest cable operator, UPC, and the second biggest in Germany, KBW. Until now, Liberty has been reticent to take on the extra expense and complication of running a mobile business, although it did look at bidding for Orange Switzerland when it was sold by France Telecom last year. A move for BASE could indicate that Liberty is willing to look at mobile opportunities when they can be done with low risk and without big spending upfront. ""Liberty sees the potential for bringing together cable and mobile businesses in the next five years, but the two businesses are very different so they also have misgivings,"" said a person close to the BASE situation. ""They want to get their toes wet without making a bold move."" Liberty could not be immediately reached for comment. The next question Liberty will face in its mobile strategy will be whether to bid for a fourth generation mobile licence in the Netherlands, which will be sold later this year. The Dutch regulator has set aside blocks of relatively cheap spectrum for new entrants in a bid to increase competition in the three-player mobile market. Such a development would be bad news for KPN on its home turf, where it earns most of its revenue and profit. With profit falling at home, KPN's debt ratios are creeping closer to its self-imposed ceiling of 2.5 times EBITDA earnings, making it tougher for it to keep dividend pledges. Like its peers, KPN saw its performance dented by competition-boosting regulatory measures and the rise of smartphones from Google and Apple, whose messaging apps allow users to avoid charges for voice and text. Selling its Belgian arm would buy KPN a little time and allow it to pay down debt. An exit from Germany, a growing business that requires steep investments to keep up with larger rivals, would be a bolder move. The recent tender offer from America Movil, which would make the Mexican telecom giant KPN's largest shareholder, could halt or slow the exit from Belgium and Germany.

201205,Facebook's Mobile Miscalculation; The Social Network Plays Catch-Up After Ignoring Its App; One Frustrated Game Maker Bows Out,"As Facebook Inc. begins life as a public company, it is confronting heightened concern about its business. One of the biggest question marks is its mobile strategy. Facebook's recent experience with app developer CrowdStar Inc. shows just how deep its mobile problems are rooted. CrowdStar was an active developer of social games on Facebook in 2010, with 50 million daily active users playing its games like ""Happy Aquarium"" and ""Happy Pets,"" said CrowdStar Chief Executive Peter Relan. But last month, CrowdStar stopped making new games for Facebook. Instead, the Burlingame, Calif., company plans to focus on creating games for mobile devices like Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Google Inc.'s Android-based phones. The reason: While the number of people accessing Facebook with their smartphone and tablets is exploding, apps such as games can't be accessed on the social network's mobile site. ""We don't see Facebook…as attractive a platform as we see the mobile platform, so we believe all our efforts in the future will be focused on the growth available in mobile,"" Mr. Relan said. Facebook takes a 30% cut of games sales through its payments system when game players buy virtual goods on the site. So games developers are paying a hefty tax to use Facebook, yet their apps don't work in the place where Facebook's growth is surging. More than half of Facebook's 900 million users access the site using smartphones and tablets, but they see a limited version of the social network that includes main features like the News Feed and friends' profiles. App makers don't have a presence on the mobile site, and Facebook only began experimenting with how mobile ads might work. ""There are a large number of developers building apps for mobile, and Facebook is a key driver of growth for many of these developers,"" said a Facebook spokesman. Now Facebook is forced to play catch-up after earlier deciding not to create a sophisticated mobile app for the site. Rather, executives wanted people to access the site using their mobile device's Web browser, said a person familiar with the matter. This person said the reason for that thinking was twofold: Facebook didn't want to be beholden to other platforms like Apple's iOS or Google's Android. The company also wanted to create one version of the site for all mobile technologies, rather than different versions for Apple iPhones or Android devices. The problem is that the technology called HTML5 that would support sophisticated games and apps won't be ready for another two or three years. The company has taken certain steps in recent months to beef up its mobile team, acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram and social discovery app Glancee. In both cases, Facebook acquired not only talent but the technology from both products. Facebook has yet to forge relationships with handset makers or carriers to push out phones that can compete, even as Apple churns out iPhones and Google closes its acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. Facebook's mobile miscalculation is underscored by how quickly people are adopting iPhones and Android phones, and using the apps through them. According to Gartner, iPhone sales are projected to hit 139 million this year, up from 25 million in 2009, while Android smartphones are expected to reach 364 million this year, up from around 7 million in 2009. As more people gravitate to smartphones and tablets, they're increasingly forgoing the desktop to the access the Web. Between 2008 and 2011, the percentage of U.S. adults who accessed the Internet from PCs daily grew to 62% from 54%. In the same period, the percentage of daily mobile Internet users rocketed to 26% from 4%, according to Forrester Research. ""People see this modality of consumption shifting from the PC to mobile,"" said Matt Murphy, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. ""On top of that, mobile feels like it's much more the kind of wide open that anybody can win kind of arena."" On Monday, some of these issues appeared to rise to the fore as Facebook's stock fell 11% to $34.03 in its second day of trading. In a research note before Facebook's IPO last week, Morningstar analyst Rick Summer listed the company's potential failure to monetize its mobile usage as a risk factor and suggested that $32 a share was a ""fair value estimate"" for the company. ""The enthusiasm for Facebook is not misplaced,"" Mr. Summer concluded, adding that he was optimistic about the company's growth opportunity with mobile, ""but the market may be underestimating several near-term challenges for the company."" Over the course of Facebook's roadshow with investors earlier this month, the company's executives were repeatedly asked about their mobile strategy. Facebook warned in its IPO prospectus that a lack of mobile advertising was a risk factor. Now Facebook needs to convince app developers like CrowdStar and others to stick with it and not abandon its platform because it lacks a strong mobile ecosystem. Facebook is still heavily dependent on one games maker, Zynga Inc. About 15% of its revenue comes from payments on the site, with most of that derived from games made by Zynga. Another Facebook games maker, Funzio Inc., which was bought by Japanese mobile game company Gree Inc. this month, said it is focusing on mobile apps, rather than Facebook's website. Anil Dharni, Funzio's chief operating officer, said when the company was founded in 2009, it had high hopes for Facebook's platform and early success with its ""Crime City"" game, which had 1.3 million monthly average users in May on the Facebook site and on its iPhone and Android apps, according to AppData. But over time, the cost of acquiring new users shot up on Facebook, and the social network also began requiring game developers to pay 30% of their revenue to the social network. So Funzio ""evaluated the mobile space and we knew we were ready to do mobile,"" said Mr. Dharni. Still, he said he hasn't written Facebook off completely. ""Whenever they [Facebook] bring the power of distribution to mobile, we think that's something we need to adopt,"" he said. Facebook's mobile problem doesn't only affect developers. Brands also build apps for the site that can't be used on smartphones or tablets, said Justin Kirstner, director of social products at analytics firm Webtrends. ""The key thing that most often comes up around mobile is, if you click on links that go to applications in Facebook, in mobile that breaks,"" he said. ""That's a big problem because of the amount of mobile usage.""
